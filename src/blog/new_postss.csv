Tech investing isn’t what it used to be — even compared to six months ago.
Investors are applying greater scrutiny to deals. Many wonder if the days of the mega round that produced the likes of Snapchat, Uber and Magic Leap are fading quickly. Founders are realizing they can’t favor growth over profitability, or vice-versa — both are crucial to success. There’s a reason VCs are calling for “a return to fundamentals” — they don’t want to see newly minted unicorns shrivel into unicorpses.
Companies need to spend their capital carefully, with an eye on steady, sustainable growth. As the pendulum continues to swing more toward smart growth, startups are naturally forced to rethink their approach to operations. Based on my experience advising portfolio companies and consulting, I believe that data-driven operations is the new table stakes for survival today. Here are a few fundamentals of data-driven ops I’d share with any company straddling that line between high-growth and sustainability.
One of the most important decisions is choosing a set of benchmarks and metrics that will actually help you measure progress toward specific goals — whether it’s profitability or growth. Don’t reinvent the wheel — look at how other companies measured up at similar stages. If you’re an enterprise SaaS company, for example, compare yourself to other SaaS startups rather than any type of company. Another best practice is to look at the data in aggregate — don’t rely on one company’s experience. I advise portfolio companies to use cumulative data (not just anecdotal evidence), whenever possible, to inform operational decisions.
Many VCs keep detailed data on key metrics, like employee compensation, sales & marketing spend, rent and other big expenditures. For example, Scale developed the SaaS Index, which tracks the performance of 58 companies, to benchmark the metrics key to the success of subscription-based software businesses. AngelList, PitchBook, Mattermark and CB Insights are examples of other resources that index startup metrics.
Sales efficiency is a key indicator of sustainable growth. You need to know the levers that drive sales efficiency — whether it’s lead costs, conversion rates or sales productivity — in order to thrive and make smart decisions. Think about sales efficiency as an ecosystem that you must constantly nurture. While it’s difficult to boost your sales efficiency with any single decision or policy, it’s easy to see it slip if you’re not keeping your eye on the ball.
In gauging sales efficiency, I recommend our portfolio companies use our Magic Number, which measures the efficiency of your go-to-market model. The Magic Number is a relatively straightforward calculation: (Revenue change x 4)/Last Quarter’s Sales and Marketing Spend. A high magic number (x>0.7) might mean it’s time to step on the growth pedal, while a low magic number (x<0.7) could indicate trouble down the road. Regardless of which situation you find yourself in, it’s important to understand your company’s financial health.
While sales efficiency is important, there are plenty of other meaningful benchmarks and KPIs that are important for businesses to monitor. You might study customer churn, sales rep productivity or net promoter score (NPS) to gauge how your company is tracking toward its goals. It’s important that everyone on your team or company is aligned on the definitions for the KPIs you choose. Once you’ve done this, you can make sure you’re improving on those KPIs against your historical performance, as well as the benchmark universe you’ve decided on.
Whether you think we’re headed for a downturn or not, there will always be ups and downs in the market. Right now, there is more of an emphasis on sustainability, given current uncertainty over the economy, criticism over companies that are running out of money and an uncertain IPO market.
No matter the economic climate, you should think about incorporating data-driven benchmarking into your approach to scaling your business. Keeping a close eye on how you’re tracking against your metrics enables you to have a clear understanding of your performance, and provides you with early indicators that you are doing well or that you need to course-correct.",2016-10-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/shutterstock_94007068.jpg?w=738,data,How startups can use data to grow smarter
1,"Ben Narasin,Jeremy Abelson","

The IPO market is poised to make an almost complete 180° turnaround after a bleak Q1 and a very quiet summer. JPMorgan alone said they were launching 20 global IPOs, and has successfully launched nine in the U.S. to strong demand. The broad market (S&P 500) has largely recovered, as well, from a low point of 1,810 earlier this year to a current (near) record level of 2,193 (as of September), a 21 percent move.
In contrast, venture capital investments, which had recalibrated alongside the IPO market in the second half of last year, have remained sedate with a clear flight to quality; fewer rounds, for higher-quality companies, with larger check sizes.
Private funding activity cannot recover as fast as the public markets. While the music seems to be back on at the IPO party, aspects of the private market re-calibration may be permanent. Eighteen months ago a SAAS company with $1 million of revenue in their first year of operation would have had a solid shot at a Tier 1 Series A. Today, those companies go wanting, resorting to “second seeds” and “inside rounds.”
The IPO window quickly cooled in August of 2015, marked by the BETR and RUN IPOs. Both were significantly oversubscribed deals that opened and traded poorly, as they weren’t able to attract real buyers/holders.
The buyer fatigue was palpable. IPO volume dried up and a buyer’s market set in.
A few IPOs dribbled out over the remaining months of 2015, with only two notable tech deals: SQ and TEAM. This was followed by an almost complete freeze at the beginning of 2016.
This closure was very well publicized, with pundits claiming it was because of market volatility caused by any number of factors, including the election, oil prices, the Fed raising rates, Brexit, China/Brazil economies, etc. There’s been little resolution to many of these factors, yet investors have still regained an appetite for IPOs.
Insiders claimed there was a complete shift in investor sentiment from growth to value, or more specifically to growth with value in the form of profitability or an obvious path to it. Investors were also concerned about debt-laden companies. This message reverberated across Silicon Valley, where companies were advised to decrease burn and show sustainability by demonstrating an ability to make money.
Tech multiples, which compressed significantly at the beginning of the year, have recovered, but not to levels as lofty as early 2015:
Two months ago, the general consensus was that the IPO market would shut down until at least 2017 — essentially 17 months with almost no IPO deal flow.
June 22, 2016, Twilio (TWLO) priced at $15 (a healthy premium to the last private round) and traded up 92 percent day 1. Since then, TWLO has traded up 278 percent and the IPO window has opened wide.
Just like that, IPOs are back in favor… all fear evaporated, all hesitation erased without any resolution to the supposed issues that precipitated the pullback originally. Perhaps all anyone needed was a breather in the shape of the most severe IPO drought since the recession.
Private company fundings followed the IPO market’s lead dropping from 1,333 in Q3 2015 to 1,137 in Q4. Deal volume stayed suppressed through Q2 2016, and this year is on pace to be slower than 2012.
Dollars raised in 2016 versus 2015, but not as significantly as deals quantity; fewer deals for larger dollars were done for the biggest and best private companies.
As the IPO market cooled, private funding showed an even more severe and immediate flight to quality. Uber and Snap alone account for $4.5 billion of the $31.8 billion in U.S. VC-backed financing in 2016. High-flyers like Slack, Airbnb and Spotify also commanded sizable rounds at, often, sizable prices.
Select innovative sub-sectors, such as artificial intelligence, insurance tech, autonomous driving and virtual reality also saw demand and excitement in line with early 2015 levels. Otherwise, venture investors have returned to more cautious, diligence-focused investing, as they had before unicorn euphoria hit, and with the complete retreat of crossover investors, venture remains largely a buyer’s market.
The bias toward proven stories has led to a significant decrease in the number of unicorns created in 2016. Twelve unicorns were created in the first two quarters of the year, compared to 49 in Q2 and Q3 of 2015.
With stocks touching all-time highs, and IPOs once again coming to market (and performing), the public market recovery is clear. Banks have said the IPO market will remain extremely active through the end of the year and into 2017.
The cracks in venture can’t be repaired that quickly. Renewed VC prudence hasn’t slowed down innovation, but it has slowed getting that innovation through the funding machine.
There has been a meaningful shift in VC interest in a company’s technology to the company itself. VC investors want to see infrastructure, track record and reliability, not just the next big idea. The rhetoric of “tell me how you are going to become the next billion-dollar business” has turned into “tell me how you are going to make this a sustainable business.”
So the large, clear winners still attract a buying frenzy, but it has become much harder for most companies, especially smaller companies, to raise. However, opportunity is knocking for VCs willing to go against the grain that have now been given more time and pricing power to selectively uncover the next unicorn.",2016-10-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/shutterstock_326595335.jpg?w=738,ipo,"While the IPO market roars back, venture remains leery"
2,Matthew Lynley,"Under pressure from shoppers complaining about losing the ability to receive tips last month as the company looked to smooth out the earnings curve, Instacart said it is re-introducing customer tipping.
“After announcing this change, we heard a lot of feedback from our shopper community,” the company said in a blog post. “While our shoppers liked most of the changes, they did not like the fact that we were removing tips from our online platform. Taking that feedback into account, we have decided to continue to accept tips as part of this change.”
CEO Apoorva Mehta stressed that the decision came from customers looking to continue tipping, rather than complaints from shoppers, which he called a small group that was “very vocal” about the change. However, following removing tips, Instacart received some backlash from shoppers who said they were losing significant portions of their earnings. The backlash went so far as to inspire a boycott among some shoppers, though again Mehta said that this was not the primary cause for returning tipping.
“We have tens of thousands of shoppers,” Mehta said. “I think that a lot of times it’s the most vocal ones you hear from. A lot of times what ends up happening is that frankly we were over-communicative, we communicated for weeks before the chain before it happened. Genuinely, I think there’s always going to be the case that we can always do better, this is one of those cases where we can definitely do better. I hope the next time changes we carry out, we hope that we’re better at it now than we were before.”

Despite all this, Mehta said the company was clearly communicating with the shopper base what the change would be. But he also said that Instacart, with the change, was “getting in the way” of customers tipping their shoppers, which would have to then rely on cash in order to give a tip for a good customer experience. One original argument for the change was that 20% of customers didn’t tip, but that other 80% comprised a significant portion of its shopper base’s income.
Instacart has to remain competitive among other on-demand services that are looking to scoop up the same potential shopper base. In that sense, Instacart has to ensure that it provides a positive shopper experience as well as a customer experience, and changing a long-accustomed to model can incite a lot of backlash. In this case, it appears that the shopper base was content with the old model, and it certainly seems like the model was working well for shoppers despite more chaotic income rates.
And as Instacart continues to expand, it’s going to have to not only rely on a good shopper experience and marketing, but also positive word of mouth from shoppers. If even a “vocal minority” ends up fighting back against changes, that’s going to cause a potential optics issue for the company’s attempts to attract new shoppers.
“What we look at, from the shopper’s perspective, there is a market-clearing wage that we have for shoppers,” Mehta said. “What we benchmark is with other on-demand services and other jobs that are similar. We need to make sure we are paying competitive to those. That’s better than anyone else, this is a competitive market, if shoppers are not able to earn a competitive wage on Instacart they will defect to other platforms.”
Customers will still pay a service fee at checkout. “This payment will be used to guarantee a higher commission to all shoppers,” the company said in a blog post. “Shoppers will no longer need to depend on tips for the majority of their compensation. This also means that customers no longer need to feel obligated to tip. However, if a customer wishes to recognize exceptional service, they will have the ability to tip their shopper directly on the Instacart platform.”
This update launches on October 17 in Washington D.C., and the change comes to San Francisco and Instacart’s other markets on October 24.",2016-10-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/instacart-thumb.jpg?w=738,apoorva-mehta,"Instacart reverses course, re-introducing tips for shoppers"
3,"Matthew Lynley,Ingrid Lunden","PayPal, the giant digital payments company that was spun off from eBay last year, has had an up-and-down relationship with the business of crowdfunding over the years, but there are some indications that this could change. We’ve been hearing that PayPal was interested in buying GoFundMe — the crowdfunding site that lets people raise money for both serious causes and lighter life events — potentially for a price above $1 billion.
It’s not clear how far conversations proceeded between the two, or if they are still active.
Both GoFundMe and PayPal said their companies do not comment on rumor or speculation; several investors and others we contacted also declined to comment. We believe conversations took place among a limited group of senior people.
Co-founded by Andrew Ballester and Brad Damphousse in 2008 in San Diego, GoFundMe has been on a growth tear. In 2015, the startup — which sits alongside others like Kickstarter, Indiegogo and Tilt, all covering different kinds of crowdfunding — raised what appears to be its only significant external funding: an undisclosed amount of money from a group of investors led by Accel and Technology Crossover Ventures (also including Iconiq Capital, Greylock and Meritech). A month later, it was revealed that Stripes invested in it, too.
As part of that transaction, the investors took a majority stake in the business, buying out the two founders in the process; installing an Accel venture partner, Rob Solomon, as CEO; and valuing the business at around $600 million. At the time, GoFundMe was estimated to be processing $100 million per month in funding for the different campaigns using its platform, growing 300 percent year-over-year.
For PayPal, a closer relationship or acquisition of a crowdfunding site would be an interesting — if surprising — turn of events.
Earlier this year, PayPal stopped offering Purchase Protection for payments made on crowdfunding platforms. The company has had a rocky relationship with the crowdfunding community, with some notable cases of freezing accounts. One of the problems for PayPal is risk management, and specifically whether it would be liable for chargebacks — that is, if a person contributing money decided that he/she wanted a refund.
At GoFundMe, PayPal was removed as a payment option altogether some time ago, replaced by a combination of Stripe and WePay. The reason given by GoFundMe was that these two allowed people to pay directly with debit or credit cards on a campaign page, and gave GoFundMe more control over the payment experience.
Earlier this month, GoFundMe took the issue of purchase protection into its own hands: it launched its own form of limited guarantee for donors and fundraisers, who respectively can claim up to $1,000 and $25,000 in the event of a campaign gone wrong. The guarantee for now is only applicable in the U.S. and Canada.
However, there are reasons why PayPal might be interested in giving crowdfunding another chance, and perhaps getting involved in it in a deeper and more serious way.
GoFundMe, which focuses on funding causes and events, may have had its share of controversy, but it’s also been a strong platform for bringing out generosity and goodwill. It’s also been very popular: one source described it as “printing money”.
A potential buyer could continue to operate GoFundMe as a separate entity. Or more strategically, the company would be a strong complement to PayPal’s existing business, which includes its ongoing relationship providing payments services to eBay, physical world point of sale, payments in third party apps through Braintree and P2P payments.

You probably have already seen plenty of campaigns for GoFundMe in your Facebook News Feed, some inspiring, maybe a few bizarre and in bad taste. Altogether, the company said in May that it has seen 25 million donors and has raised around $2 billion total.
GoFundMe, like other commerce platforms, takes a 5% share of the total transaction volume, in addition to a small additional fee through the commerce platforms it uses. Because the site basically operates on the principles of an online social network and (today) relies on outside payment providers, it has little overhead — meaning the gross margin for an operation like this is likely very high.
And integrated with PayPal, GoFundMe could become even more valuable.

4,Megan Rose Dickey,"Uber, the ridesharing behemoth that recently began operating driverless cars and exploring self-flying drone taxis, can’t seem to catch a break these days in the legal arena. The New York State Department of Labor has ruled that two Uber drivers, Jakir Hossain and Levon Alesanian, are indeed employees — not contractors —  and therefore eligible to receive unemployment benefits, the New York Times reports. Now, Hossain and Alesanian are eligible for weekly unemployment payments of up to $425 each.
Back in July, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance sued the state on behalf of the two drivers for refusing to “investigate or adjudicate complaints for unemployment insurance benefits.” Hossain and Alesanian had filed for unemployment after getting deactivated from Uber’s platform, but their applications were not being reviewed for months. This ruling only applies to the two drivers, but now the NYTWA is seeking a “comprehensive audit” of Uber.
“I think this is a game-changer,” NYTWA Executive Director Bhairavi Desai said at a press conference today. “Uber has depended on the political structure turning a blind eye. What these decisions do is force a microscopic review.”
The hopes is that Uber would be forced to make all of its drivers employees. If that happens, Uber would suffer a hit on its bottom line. Some of the differences between independent contractors and W-2 employees are that employees are eligible for minimum wage, workers’ compensation insurance and other protections, while contractors are not. Employers also have to “withhold income taxes, withhold and pay Social Security and Medicare taxes, and pay unemployment tax on wages paid to an employee,” according to the Internal Revenue Service. For employees, W-2 status gives them access to training programs and, more importantly, benefits like overtime, or reimbursement for gas and other car expenses. In short, that means it would be more costly to Uber if it had to offer W-2 employment to its drivers.
“Nearly 90 percent of drivers say the main reason they use Uber is because they love being their own boss,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement. “Drivers use Uber on their own terms; they control their use of the app along with where and when they drive.  As employees, drivers would lose the personal flexibility they value most — they would have set shifts, earn a fixed hourly wage, and be unable to use other ridesharing apps. While the Department of Labor has ruled that several drivers are independent contractors, we have appealed the other determinations.”
But this is just the latest in a series of legal woes the company has been facing. Uber’s battling a nationwide class-action lawsuit that aims to achieve employee status for drivers. Meanwhile, back in August, a San Francisco judge rejected a $100 million settlement Uber had reached over their employment categorizations for drivers in California and Massachusetts.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/uber-volvo-self-driving1.jpg?w=738,lawsuits,Uber hits another roadblock
5,Ajay Chopra,"

Despite what some politicians say, no country is an island in today’s rapidly changing world. In the same way, no company can survive as an island, either.
Most won’t have noticed a recent $6.5 million Series A for a company called Mobilize, but it’s indicative of a major change occurring in businesses today. Companies’ growing reliance on a distributed workforce have been occupying headlines and podcasts for the past couple of years. However, these conversations must now turn to how companies increasingly depend on partnerships as their force multiplier.
The most successful companies today live or die based upon their business partners, whether they be channel partners, technology partners, suppliers or outsourced operations partners. Some of the wisest business leaders realize that the only way to scale and remain competitive is to stick to their core competency — then, work collaboratively with other groups whose complementary core competencies can make a business process more efficient than by trying (and largely failing) to create such disparate capabilities themselves.
The result? A business that is more nimble, while remaining focused on building greater value for shareholders, employees and customers. When each party does what it is expert at, everyone can add value efficiently up and down the value chain.
Furthermore, by working with a broad demographic of partners externally, companies are able to be far more responsive to market and perception changes. Integrated partners are able to relay changes back to the core company more quickly, and, when there is a response the partners are involved in developing or supportive of, they provide a sizable ambassadorship that would’ve otherwise taken huge investments of time and effort to rally organically.
It’s no wonder, then, that the largest hotel company in the world, Airbnb, does not own any hotels, relying instead on a network of accommodation provider partners. Fun fact: This network includes more than 1,400 castles, which I doubt they would have had access to otherwise. And the largest “taxi” company in the world, Uber, doesn’t own any cabs. Instead, they rely on an expansive network of driving partners.
For companies like Airbnb, Uber, ClassPass, Thumbtack and countless others, partners are mission-critical to their operation and value proposition. They would not exist without these partnerships working seamlessly to help them execute their core competency and vision.
And the partnership trend isn’t limited to just consumer companies. Significant open-source software companies, starting with Red Hat years ago and Docker more recently, would cease to exist without the partner communities on which they were built.
The networks of partnerships that all kinds of companies are acknowledging as essential to their businesses are growing and becoming more diverse in terms of their purpose, size, type and geographies. In the same fashion, in light of recent changes in the economy, traditional companies are rethinking and re-investing more in their partner programs, too — relying even more on affiliates, resellers, franchisers and any external network that can broaden their reach and impact.
Naturally, as with any business development, this new paradigm is creating other business opportunities. There’s come a growing need for companies to quickly and coherently communicate with and manage fluid relationships with these partner communities. Good-old emails no longer need apply. Just raise your hand if you think that would be the best way to send a mission critical message to a Lyft driver about surge pricing in New Orleans at 6pm tonight!
Furthermore, the tracking and engagement of ever-growing groups of partners across their actions and milestones can result in significant internal team demands. Some companies have long offered group communication tools that go beyond emailing to more dynamic communication, but they’ve largely been left for people to adopt to their own needs. Google Groups, Facebook Messenger and others weren’t built around the specific needs of managing sizable groups of people like on-demand workers or a city’s-worth of dinner hosts.
Slack and HipChat provide a good hub for informal conversation and the sharing of materials, though targeted toward internal teams. Mobilize provides a more developed platform for communicating, scheduling and driving impact with regard for diverse partner contexts.
Companies large and small — from MasterCard to Maker Faire — are already migrating to Mobilize’s platform from other solutions so they can better manage their growing external partnerships without having to grow internal teams. There are already internal job titles and consultants lining up to help manage these groups, so the need for platforms focused on managing these networks of partner groups is only growing.
As these partnerships grow and the platforms that support them develop, rhythms for partner relationship management will evolve. Today, these rhythms are more a tap on the drum set. Someday they’ll become fluid jam sessions. This will require focused attention and understanding of how different groups live, behave and what they want from these partnerships, as well. But the companies that engage in the partnered economy will be rewarded with the strongest ties with these groups, through to their customers, and become the most adept at working through market and other changes beyond their control. This in turn will allow them continued growth and tenure at the top of their industries.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-495828975.jpg?w=738,partnerships,From the distributed workforce to the partnered economy
6,Matthew Lynley,"Today, Pinterest said it hit 150 million monthly active users, up from the 100 million it announced in September 2015.
However, as TechCrunch previously reported, Pinterest in 2015 was targeting that it would hit 151 million monthly active users by the end of 2015. We reported the story in October last year, and the information was used by Andreessen Horowitz to solicit limited partners to invest in a special investment fund for Pinterest earlier in the year.
With Pinterest growing by half this year, it looks like it may miss on its 2016 projections that it set earlier last year as well. Leaked documents reviewed by TechCrunch at the time also projected that Pinterest would end 2016 at 218 million monthly active users. The Wall Street Journal today also reported the company is expected to triple last year’s revenue to $300 million in 2016. That, too, falls below projected estimates of $663 million for 2016 from those leaked documents.
Again, these projections came in early 2015, and companies are constantly revising them as the years progress. Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann, in response to those projections, told The Wall Street Journal that “there were some early projections when we were just a couple months into building the business, but we’ve learned more about it.”
“Start up life is dynamic, and years old projections aren’t particularly relevant to where companies are today,” Andreessen-Horowitz partner Jeff Jordan, who is on Pinterest’s board, told TechCrunch. “We’re thrilled with Pinterest’s performance — strong continued user growth, best-in-class user engagement, and an increasingly robust platform for advertisers that’s leading to rapidly expanding revenue. We’re very excited about what’s to come.”
Revenue of $100 million for 2015, and potentially $300 million for 2016, are enviable numbers for a consumer ad-driven startup that’s only 7 years old. This isn’t really a reflection of poor performance for Pinterest, it would seem — just that the expectations may have been set a little high. Many startups are sometimes valued, to some extent, at a multiple of next year’s revenue. While Pinterest’s valuation is likely also relative to the latent pent-up marketing and user demand, as well as its growth and overhead, it would still seem the company needed to reset its expectations.

Last week, the company announced that it had brought on its first chief financial officer, former Twitter executive Todd Morgenfeld. But at that time, The Wall Street Journal reported that the company had generated $100 million in 2015, which fell below its projections of $169 million. To be sure, 50% growth year-over-year would be an enviable clip for any service with more than 100 million users (as in, Twitter), but there has always been a question as to what the upper bound of Pinterest would be beyond really powerful use cases like wedding planning or recipes.
There are a lot of potential reasons for this. With Facebook still immensely growing, scooping up new communications platforms and offering a wider array of advertising products, advertisers may be more inclined to simply stick to what they know. And the experimental budgets that these firms have, which previously may have gone to Pinterest, may be shifting to other emerging platforms like Snapchat, which has 150 million daily active users. Snapchat, a 5-year-old company, is already projecting revenue as high as between $500 million and $1 billion for 2017.
The souring on alternative platforms to Facebook and traditional advertising has been made increasingly apparent as Twitter’s valuation has dropped off a cliff. In recent weeks, reports came out that suitors have emerged (and slinked back, and emerged, and so on) to buy Twitter. That sent Twitter’s shares rocketing up, but it’s since cratered back to a market cap of around $12.5 billion. That’s not too far off from Pinterest’s valuation of $11 billion in its previous financing round.
Pinterest has increasingly offered an advertising tool that serves a larger funnel than other services. While Facebook — and likely Snapchat — are very effective at awareness and brand advertising, Pinterest has billed itself as a way for marketers to push users further and further toward conversion. It can get their attention at the awareness phase, their intention to purchase with search, and finally a conversion when they are pinning products or even purchasing them. For many kinds of products, particularly fashion, Pinterest is one of a very small set of marketing tools that touches users at every point in a purchasing life cycle.
That’s also why it’s been aggressively investing in tools surrounding visual search, including a tool that would allow users to search for products with photos from their smartphone cameras. Those sort of things are designed to capture the moment of an impulse purchase, increasingly offering alternative marketing products to its partners — and potentially to draw advertising dollars away from Facebook (or Snapchat).
In addition, Pinterest is also an online advertising service. Something like that might generally require little overhead, and to be sure, the company is generating a lot of revenue. It raised $553 million in its last financing round that valued it at $11 billion, so at face value it would appear that the company shouldn’t have any fear of running out of cash despite a lot of R&D investment and talent acquisitions — to go along with a healthy revenue stream.
What remains to be seen is whether this represents a more general trend for Pinterest. Will it being to see slowing user growth similar to Twitter, or more sustained gains like Facebook? The company’s international expansion appears to be going effectively, with 80 million of its users coming from outside the United States. There are of course different cultural quirks in different countries, but there’s clear demand for a service like Pinterest.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/pinterest-save-button.jpg?w=738,pinterest,"Pinterest hits 150M monthly users, missing earlier leaked projections in 2015"
7,Jordan Crook,"It’s not uncommon to feel a bit helpless at the end of a news binge. Oftentimes, the news leans toward the negative side and doesn’t offer much in the way of a solution.
But Speakable, a startup founded by Jordan Hewson, wants to give people the opportunity to do something at the exact time and place that they feel called to take action.
The year-old startup today introduced the Action Button, which is a snippet of code that lives on publishers’ article pages and gives their readers the option to take direct action. Speakable’s technology is able to understand the content and sentiment of an article and match it with the proper non-profit partner.
From there, users can click the Action Button to send an email to a legislator or tweet to a decision-maker or even make a donation. But the Action Button, and it’s subsequent actions, never take the user away from the article page itself.
Speakable also vets all of its NGO partners to ensure that they have a big impact and appropriate funds responsibly.
The company already has big-name publishing partners onboard, including the Guardian US, The Huffington Post, and VICE Media.
“My long-term vision for the action button is to be able to go after other types of content, whether it’s a YouTube video or a documentary,” said Hewson. “Eventually, you should be able to come across any piece of content and take action within 30 seconds or less.”
For now, Speakable is entirely free to both publishers and NGO partners while the company focuses on growing and fine-tuning the product.

The recall follows reports by customers of the food bars making them “violently ill” — with complaints including nausea and diarrhea.
It’s not clear how many customers felt sick after eating the bar but clearly enough to convince Soylent to act.
In an update on its blog detailing the product recall, the company writes: “It has recently come to our attention that a small number of our customers have experienced gastrointestinal issues after consuming Soylent Bars. As a precautionary measure, we are halting all Soylent Bar purchases and shipments and are advising our customers to discard any remaining bars in their possession.”
The startup, which has raised some $22.3M in funding since being founded in 2013, says it has been investigating the complaints — but has not yet been able to identify a root cause.
“Though our investigation into this matter continues, we have decided to err on the side of caution and take this preventative step,” it says, adding: “We will be reaching out via e-mail to all Bar customers to offer a full refund.”
It also apologizes for “any negative experiences after eating a Soylent Bar”, and suggests customers discard any remaining bars uneaten.
The Soylent Bar’s full ingredients list runs pretty long — perhaps raising the risk of allergies to particular substances. On its website the company does also note the bar is not allergen-free, given it contains soy and gluten.
Among its main listed ingredients are: Soy Protein Isolate, Corn Syrup, Oat Flour, Canola Oil, Glycerine, Whole Algae Floue, Isomaltulose, Isomaltooligosaccharide Fiber and Oatmeal.
We’ve reached out to Soylent with questions about the recall and will update this post with any response.

9,Anthony Ha,"Four digital media organizations are coming together to form a new holding company — and they’ve also raised $100 million in additional funding from Discovery Communications.
Those four companies are Thrillist (lifestyle), NowThis Media (video news), The Dodo (animals) and Discovery’s digital network Seeker (including its production studio SourceFed). Thrillist’s Ben Lerer will become CEO of the combined organization.
Why these companies? In the press release announcing the merger, Lerer described this as “truly a ‘win-win’ scenario,” allowing each brand to operate independently while tapping into the resources of “one of the best media and entertainment companies in the world.”
“Each of our brands has found great success independently, but with consolidation of digital content companies around the corner, there is extraordinary value in all existing under one multi-brand roof,” he said. “We will be stronger brands working together – we will have more influence; we will have better data and insights; we will be better partners to our advertisers; and most importantly, we will be substantial enough to make a real difference and stay ahead of the market.”
After the deal, advertisers will also be able to buy campaigns that run across all four properties.

While Discovery (which previously invested in The Dodo) will be a minority investor in Group Nine, it will have the option to buy a controlling stake. Axel Springer, which backed Thrillist and NowThis, will be the second largest shareholder in the company.
Group Nine says its brands collectively deliver 3.5 billion video views each month and have more than 12 billion monthly social impressions.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ben-lerer.jpg?w=738,"discovery,nowthis-news,thrillist","Thrillist, NowThis, The Dodo and Seeker form a new, Discovery-backed holding company"
10,Sarah Perez,"Pluto TV, a video streaming service targeting cord cutters by offering a TV-guide like experience that connects you to hundreds of online channels, has raised $30 million in Series B funding, valuing the business at $140 million. The new funding comes from ProSieben of Germany, one of Europe’s largest independent media companies, and lifestyle media company Scripps Networks Interactive. The additional capital will help to fuel Pluto TV’s expansion into the European market, the company says.
ProSieben led the oversubscribed round, which also included participation from new investors Scripps Network Interactive and Sallfort PrivatBank. Existing investors USVP, Sky, Luminari Capital, Chicago Ventures and Thirdwave Capital Partners joined, as well.
The company, which last year nabbed Spotify’s chief content officer Ken Parks for its executive chairman, raised $13 million in Series A funding in late 2014.
Unlike other online streaming services, which also cater to those who still subscribe traditional television, Pluto TV from the start has more narrowly focused on acquiring consumers who are abandoning their cable and satellite TV subscriptions. However, instead of offering on-demand TV and movies like Netflix, Pluto TV attempts to replicate the TV experience through online streams that you can “tune into” much like TV broadcasting.

In the U.S., the company has over 75 content partnerships with TV networks, studios, publishers and digital media companies, including Sky, NBC, A&E, CBSi, Bloomberg, Paramount and others.
It’s also adding content via newcomers to the streaming video market, whose niche offerings may have otherwise struggled to find traction. This is the case with the recent launch of the celeb and pop culture-focused PEN, for example – aka the People Entertainment Network, a joint project from People and Entertainment Weekly.
This area, perhaps, is where Pluto TV has the most potential. Explains Pluto TV co-founder and CEO, Tom Ryan, it will be difficult for consumers to discover all the niche services, especially given “how chaotic and crowded the space has become and how high the cost of user acquisition is,” he says.

“Pluto TV has already aggregated over 5 million [monthly active users] in one place and a lot of these niche services are already looking to us to help them get their content discovered and drive users to their platforms,” Ryan adds. “We believe most consumers don’t want to go in and out of different apps for their entertainment.”
To some extent, this is Amazon’s strategy as well, but with paid networks. The company now allows users to add on subscriptions to channels like Showtime and Starz through Amazon Video. The difference is that Pluto TV is focused on free video, not premium channels.
Pluto TV attributes its user growth – up from 500,000 in the first quarter of 2015 – to the accelerating cord-cutting trend, as well as to distribution partnerships with Vizio Cast and the new Xiaomi Mi Box, where it comes pre-installed.
It also has apps for streaming media devices, like Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, and more recently, PlayStation 3 and 4.
The company also acquired Berlin-based TV startup Quazer in order to immediately arrive in Germany, while also giving it footing in Europe as it prepares to expand. Including the acquisition, Pluto TV now has a team of 50 and plans to hire a VP Sales to begin building out its direct sales team in the months ahead.
Currently, the startup generates revenue through advertising, which comes through its content and device partners selling into the platform, as well as programmatic. Ryan declined to discuss the revenue situation in detail, however.
“We can’t discuss the details of our financials but I can tell you that, having only started monetization less than a year ago, we and our content partners are delighted with the progress,” he says.
According to Ryan, the company plans to use the new funds to further invest in product, content and marketing, while also moving toward the goal of becoming a global destination for free television.
“With this funding and the expansion into Europe, Pluto TV is uniquely positioned to become the global OTT destination for free television. That’s the goal. That’s the future of TV,” he says.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/screen_in_laptop.png?w=738,"computing,pluto-tv,video-on-demand,internet-television","Pluto TV, a free streaming service for cord cutters, raises $30 million more"
11,Jordan Crook,"Ever wonder which of your selfies is best? Tinder wants to help you figure it out, with the launch of a new feature called Smart Photos. And Smart Photos, in turn, show us just how much Tinder is a big data company, meticulously collecting information about what (and who) you like and don’t like.
Smart Photos is a single toggle in the Profile section of the app. When toggled on, Tinder continuously tests your various profile photos to determine which one is most popular, and automatically serves up that photo first in your ‘deck.’
Not only does the Smart Photos algorithm take into account overall popularity of your photos, but it also accounts for the swiping patterns of people looking at your profile.
So let’s say that you have one regular selfie, one picture of you sky-diving, and one picture of you with your Schnauzer named Donald.
The pic of you and the pup gets more overall right swipes than any other picture, and is served up as the first picture (or, calling card) of your profile most of the time. But, if your profile is about to be served up to someone who typically swipes left on dogs, Tinder re-orders your photos to show the selfie or sky-diving first to that particular person.

This is where things get really interesting.
Tinder has long been quiet about what kind of information it takes into account about its users. There is the obvious stuff, like gender, age, location, bio information, and if you hook up your Instagram then that’s even more data. But Tinder has never outright said that paying attention to what each individual user is swiping right and left on within an image.
In fact, the company has always said that the most ‘successful’ photos are the ones where you’re “being yourself.”
In testing, Tinder found that folks with Smart Photos toggled on saw up to 12 percent increase in matches. But the implications go well beyond more matches on Tinder.
In more ways than one, Tinder is a big data company. With millions of engaged users, Tinder is constantly trying to figure out how to serve you the most relevant matches in your area. And on that quest, the company is likely pulling in whatever data points it possibly can about you.
This type of information — that you hate pictures of dogs or that you tend to prefer buff, blonde guys — can be used in a variety of ways that go beyond matching you with other Tinder users.
For example, Tinder has an advertising product, where ads are served directly in the feed of folks who don’t pay to use the app (Tinder Plus). You could see how information about what you find attractive could be valuable to advertisers and other entities over time, especially as the world inches toward more targeted, personalized marketing.
It’ll likely be a long while before Tinder is actively using its troves of data — about who you like, and if you’re in the majority, and all your deal-breakers — to help marketers and advertisers better sell to you. But Smart Photos tells us a lot about what kind of data Tinder is collecting about its users.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/tindermatch.jpeg?w=738,,Tinder’s new Smart Photos show just how well the app knows you
12,Steve O'Hear,"Back in the days when I did a startup I almost de-railed our VC funding after discovering my passport had expired. Without it I couldn’t pass the anti-money laundering checks imposed on the fancy and overpriced London law firm we’d hired. Then we almost failed to open a bank account so we could actually receive the money because we were unable to fly over all of our investors from Eastern and Central Europe to pass ID checks in person. The takeaway: compliance is a pain in the ass.
Enter ComplyAdvantage, a London-based startup that claims to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to help firms manage compliance obligations and at reduced cost. The young company is announcing $8.2 million in Series A funding led by Balderton Capital, money it plans to plough into growth across Europe and the U.S., including opening a New York office this week.
Founded by Charles Delingpole, who previously founded Market Invoice, ComplyAdvantage originally launched to help a small number of businesses meet complex anti-money laundering (AML) and counter financing of terrorism (CFT) requirements. It has since developed its product to also cover things like Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) lists and other risk and compliance areas that are hard to scale.
“The way organisations screen and monitor their customer relationships to comply with sanctions regulations and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing risk is fundamentally broken,” ComplyAdvantage VP of Sales & Marketing Stephen Ball tells me over email. “ComplyAdvantage is here to help compliance and risk professionals fix it”.
“Legacy technologies are outdated, expensive and inefficient, typically generating large amounts of manual work in the form of unnecessary risk alerts for the team to review,” he adds, citing as an example a customer having the same name as a completely different Politically Exposed Person. “Furthermore, the criminals are winning, with existing solutions having limited impact on actually reducing financial crime”.
That, argues Ball, has left compliance officers jaded. Originally attracted to the role of fighting crime, they find themselves often doing a box-ticking exercise that is ineffective but designed to keep the companies they work for on the right side of the regulators, even if that often fails too. Meanwhile, regulator fines are kind of expected and baked into the pricing models of financial services.
To fix this, ComplyAdvantage is betting that AI and machine learning can help compliance scale properly and says the startup is part of a “regtech revolution” that is coming to financial services. “ComplyAdvantage are at the forefront unleashing the power of AI and ML to change the way compliance is done,” says the VP of Sales & Marketing.
Adds Tim Bunting, General Partner at Balderton Capital, in a statement: “We believe that this is one of the few remaining large industries that is still ripe for digital disruption. We are thrilled to be backing Charles and his team, they are well on their way to changing the way companies can understand and monitor risk around their clients. Their mission is truly exciting, and relevant to all businesses.”",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/charles.jpg?w=738,,ComplyAdvantage raises $8.2M Series A to help firms manage compliance
13,Anthony Ha,"PlaceIQ has a new, big-name investor — Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.
The companies aren’t disclosing the size of the deal; they’ll only say that it’s a strategic, minority investment, and that it’s an addition to the $25 million round that PlaceIQ announced at the beginning of this year. Co-founder and CEO Duncan McCall told me this is part of a larger partnership, where Alibaba will be using PlaceIQ’s technology.
“I don’t want to speak for [Alibaba], but in my mind, they didn’t want to invest in a company — they wanted to find a strategic partner,” McCall said.
PlaceIQ combines location data with “first-party” data from marketers to provide a fuller understanding of consumer behavior — not just whether someone’s visited a car dealership, for example, but whether they’re actually shopping for a car, and what kinds of TV stations they’re likely to watch.
McCall said Alibaba could use PlaceIQ’s technology in a variety of ways, including marketing, product recommendations and providing data for broader decision-making. 
McCall also suggested that as PlaceIQ looks to expand internationally, it will continue to follow this partnership model.
“For us, our core value is in the data and technology,” he said. “When we want to get into [a new geography], let’s find the market leader and deploy with them.”",2016-10-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/world-map.png?w=738,"location,placeiq","Alibaba backs PlaceIQ, a provider of location tools and data"
14,John Rampton,"

The JOBS Act was signed into law by President Obama in 2012, allowing companies to acquire funding through online portals from non-accredited investors, which roughly accounts for 97 percent of the population in the United States. On May 16, 2016, Title III of the JOBS Act, also known as regulation crowdfunding, or equity crowdfunding, was the last section to be implemented by the SEC. 
With such a large pool of potential investors looking to enter the market, it would seem that the crowdfunding and investment communities would be extremely welcoming of Title III — but it seems like the exact opposite is happening. This could be because not enough is understood about this type of crowdfunding. As a founder who has tried all types of crowdfunding, I’ve seen significant benefits to all platforms, including equity crowdfunding.
Equity crowdfunding shares similarities with Kickstarter campaigns in terms of how a company must spread their message to potential investors about their products in order to successfully raise enough funding. However, the main difference between equity crowdfunding, rewards-based crowdfunding and donation-based crowdfunding is the investor’s end goal in rewards-based crowdfunding, such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Rewards-based fundraising is aimed at enticing investors based on the benefits they would receive in relation to the amount they contribute.
As a founder, I’ve used this type of crowdfunding, and have helped others do so with great results. It’s been ideal for taking a prototype to the next level because those investing are excited about the concept they see and are incentivized to invest because they will most likely be one of the first to receive the new product. I’ve experienced wildly successful rewards-based crowdfunding; it’s been the reason our company could move to the next level in our development.
Donation-based crowdfunding seeks funding that comes as goodwill from the community. This method is geared toward charitable contributions rather than capital acquisition, which is the aim of equity crowdfunding. When investing through equity crowdfunding, an investor receives shares in the company instead of a final product, which tends to yield a greater benefit for the investor long-term. The way the shares are structured allows the founders to retain control of their company even after selling a portion of their equity to multiple investors across the country.
While equity crowdfunding was developed with the intention of providing significant benefits, many have professed some major concerns related to how equity crowdfunding might change the funding landscape. The major concerns include the numerous intimidating filing requirements that entrepreneurs must fill out for the SEC, the need for constant reporting to the SEC, the requirement that company financials be made available to investors and the review or audit of financials by an accountant based on how much you have raised.
However, others believe these requirements are justified. Manny Fernandez, CEO and co-founder of Dreamfunded and the 2014 Equity Crowdfunding Leadership Award recipient, notes, “When a company is just starting, transparency in terms of financials is irrelevant because there is nothing to hide from potential investors. This is one of the various ways in which established investors are trying to maintain control of entrepreneurs and prevent them from finding alternate funding opportunities apart from the traditional methods. It makes good business sense to all involved.”
Another concern has been the liability companies might face when an investment venture, failing to generate any returns or growth, shuts down. A decision such as this made by founders may motivate some jilted investors to seek compensation for their lost investment. However, when an entrepreneur fills out a Form C, full disclosure is made to potential investors about the risks, which are associated with investing in the company.
It is highly unlikely that any disgruntled investor would be able to win any lawsuit seeking reparations as long as general risks involved in their investment are disclosed to potential investors. Also, investment limitations based on income level have been established by FINRA and the SEC to help investors not risk their entire pension or life savings by making one bad investment.
Another issue has been the fact that because there tend to be smaller investment amounts with equity crowdfunding, the cost of using this type of crowdfunding platform might outweigh the benefits of it, as smaller individual investment amounts may raise the amount of investors on the cap table. In addition, the fee charged by funding portals reduces the total amount raised. However, although the amount per investor is smaller, there is also a larger amount of people who are helping you watch the business grow.
For me, as an entrepreneur, I’ve spent a considerable amount of time and money looking for potential investors for my digital wallet startup who are not always readily available, in the local area or willing to invest in the idea that they are pitched. Instead, with equity crowdfunding, I pay a fee and then get access to more investors, which has saved me considerable time, money and effort, as well as enables me to get started on building out my company sooner.
One of the greatest benefits with equity crowdfunding is that I can set my own terms for the shares of the company, providing me with more autonomy and freedom. The shares sold through equity crowdfunding are limited to only one class of securities, so there are no voting rights. Instead, the investor is simply investing in the company’s profitability and success. This process has helped me maintain control and minimize any potential threat of investors commanding the direction of the company during the early stage of fundraising.
Some entrepreneurs have expressed their dislike of the fact that there is a fundraising limit of a million dollars over a 12-month period. However, it’s important to remember that this type of funding is typically only for the first round, and it can be used again for future stages of growth or other types of funding can be implemented at that point. Also, some of my companies started on much less funding and I was able to leverage more funding through equity crowdfunding at a later stage when I really needed a larger amount.

The second proposal is the “test the waters” provision, which allows entrepreneurs to gauge the interest of potential investors through an online portal before they take the time, effort and money to extend an initial offering. The third proposal is to allow for the use of SPVs (special purpose vehicles), which would help entrepreneurs keep their cap tables organized because the investors of low-dollar amounts are grouped together into one large fund that appears on the cap table as one large entity. These proposed fixes are now up to the Senate to decide, and it will take at least a year for it to be passed.
In the meantime, I highly recommend considering equity crowdfunding, as it has offered an additional avenue for funding without having to contend with investors who want to take over and run my business.
As an entrepreneur, I know that risk is just part of the game. If I always played it safe, I wouldn’t be here today, with a rapidly growing online invoicing and payments business. The risk involved with equity crowdfunding is minimal. What I always recommend before using any kind of funding vehicle is to do your research, understand what is involved in terms of benefits and risks and determine how you could use the funds wisely at a certain stage in your startup’s development.
Today’s equity crowdfunding marketplace also has credible platforms that are driving greater success for those using this funding source and connecting more entrepreneurs quickly to the investors they need to become successful.",2016-10-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/shutterstock_305221517.png?w=738,"securities-and-exchange-commission,equity-crowdfunding",What regulation crowdfunding in the JOBS Act means to entrepreneurs and startups
15,John Mannes,"On the heels of Samsung’s acquisition of Viv just a week ago, a new AI assistant has risen into the spotlight and is jockeying to fill the shoes of its now well-known rival. Ozlo, the Greylock- and Jerry Yang-backed independent entrant to the personal assistant race, is launching today on iOS and the web in an effort to give stalwarts like Siri, Alexa and Cortana a run for their money.
The new personal assistant promises early adopters a good memory, a brain full of knowledge, and an independent soul — everything you could hope for in your new binary friend.
When I sat down with Charles Jolley, CEO of Ozlo and previous head of platform for Facebook on Android, the two of us immediately had a nice laugh about the repetitive female names for assistants in the marketplace right now — Ozlo, by name alone, is already something different. That said, a name is one thing; the more important question is whether Ozlo is useful and doesn’t make its users want to throw their phone against a wall after use.
I’ve been using the assistant for the last few weeks and have been mostly impressed. The bar is still quite low for assistants and us enthusiasts have to find small things to get excited about, but that wasn’t a problem with Ozlo.
One thing in particular that Ozlo delivered well was a good memory of my previous interactions with him. For people that suffer from gluten allergies, Ozlo can digest that information and put it to use later on when you ask for a cute date spot. This is a feature that Google’s new assistant is heavily investing in, but after initial use, Allo still struggles with. When the app first dropped, I had an extended frustrating conversation trying to convince it that juice and coffee were in fact two distinct preferences rather than some weird personality tick where I can only drink coffee if juice is also present.
Jolley is insistent that Ozlo isn’t simply useful for users, but is a critical piece of the the AI ecosystem itself. Ozlo is a personal assistant independent of the big tech illuminati of Google, Baidu, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. When we met, Viv was still among its private brethren, but with the company’s new connection to Samsung, the impetus has only become greater.
Big tech conglomerates have a strong market advantage when it comes to the size and scope of their data sets. For example, much of the hype around Google’s assistant relates to its integration with Google Search. Jolley wants us to remember that bigger isn’t always better. These companies tend to prioritize their own services when responding to queries even if a more holistic response could come with better integrations.
Ozlo is launching integrated with services like Yelp, TripAdvisor, Zagat, Michelin, DoorDash, IMDB, Westworld Media, TimeOut, the Infatuation, and Yummly. He also has support from Further Food, Authority Nutrition, Gluten Free Globetrotter, Gluten Free Mrs. D, and Cookies and Kate to provide nutritional guidance.
Every assistant on the market right now could use some training in the natural language understanding department, and Ozlo is no different. Accuracy is improving with data and the box of potential queries is getting larger, but it is still fundamentally a box. This isn’t to say that Ozlo is frustrating to use, just important to remember to keep expectations in check. It will be interesting to see how he continues to adapt to my speaking style in the coming weeks while keeping an eye on future deep hardware integrations with AI. Pixel gave us a taste of that but it won’t be the end. Ozlo’s thesis requires that a world exist outside of those integrations, now it’s just a matter of watching the games play out to see if independence can trump convenience.",2016-10-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-12-at-8-35-26-am.png?w=738,artificial-intelligence,Ozlo AI assistant is the new underdog filling the void left by Viv
16,Matthew Lynley,"Under pressure from shoppers complaining about losing the ability to receive tips last month as the company looked to smooth out the earnings curve, Instacart said it is re-introducing customer tipping.
“After announcing this change, we heard a lot of feedback from our shopper community,” the company said in a blog post. “While our shoppers liked most of the changes, they did not like the fact that we were removing tips from our online platform. Taking that feedback into account, we have decided to continue to accept tips as part of this change.”
CEO Apoorva Mehta stressed that the decision came from customers looking to continue tipping, rather than complaints from shoppers, which he called a small group that was “very vocal” about the change. However, following removing tips, Instacart received some backlash from shoppers who said they were losing significant portions of their earnings. The backlash went so far as to inspire a boycott among some shoppers, though again Mehta said that this was not the primary cause for returning tipping.
“We have tens of thousands of shoppers,” Mehta said. “I think that a lot of times it’s the most vocal ones you hear from. A lot of times what ends up happening is that frankly we were over-communicative, we communicated for weeks before the chain before it happened. Genuinely, I think there’s always going to be the case that we can always do better, this is one of those cases where we can definitely do better. I hope the next time changes we carry out, we hope that we’re better at it now than we were before.”

Despite all this, Mehta said the company was clearly communicating with the shopper base what the change would be. But he also said that Instacart, with the change, was “getting in the way” of customers tipping their shoppers, which would have to then rely on cash in order to give a tip for a good customer experience. One original argument for the change was that 20% of customers didn’t tip, but that other 80% comprised a significant portion of its shopper base’s income.
Instacart has to remain competitive among other on-demand services that are looking to scoop up the same potential shopper base. In that sense, Instacart has to ensure that it provides a positive shopper experience as well as a customer experience, and changing a long-accustomed to model can incite a lot of backlash. In this case, it appears that the shopper base was content with the old model, and it certainly seems like the model was working well for shoppers despite more chaotic income rates.
And as Instacart continues to expand, it’s going to have to not only rely on a good shopper experience and marketing, but also positive word of mouth from shoppers. If even a “vocal minority” ends up fighting back against changes, that’s going to cause a potential optics issue for the company’s attempts to attract new shoppers.
“What we look at, from the shopper’s perspective, there is a market-clearing wage that we have for shoppers,” Mehta said. “What we benchmark is with other on-demand services and other jobs that are similar. We need to make sure we are paying competitive to those. That’s better than anyone else, this is a competitive market, if shoppers are not able to earn a competitive wage on Instacart they will defect to other platforms.”
Customers will still pay a service fee at checkout. “This payment will be used to guarantee a higher commission to all shoppers,” the company said in a blog post. “Shoppers will no longer need to depend on tips for the majority of their compensation. This also means that customers no longer need to feel obligated to tip. However, if a customer wishes to recognize exceptional service, they will have the ability to tip their shopper directly on the Instacart platform.”
This update launches on October 17 in Washington D.C., and the change comes to San Francisco and Instacart’s other markets on October 24.",2016-10-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/instacart-thumb.jpg?w=738,apoorva-mehta,"Instacart reverses course, re-introducing tips for shoppers"

18,Matthew Lynley,"Today, Pinterest said it hit 150 million monthly active users, up from the 100 million it announced in September 2015.
However, as TechCrunch previously reported, Pinterest in 2015 was targeting that it would hit 151 million monthly active users by the end of 2015. We reported the story in October last year, and the information was used by Andreessen Horowitz to solicit limited partners to invest in a special investment fund for Pinterest earlier in the year.
With Pinterest growing by half this year, it looks like it may miss on its 2016 projections that it set earlier last year as well. Leaked documents reviewed by TechCrunch at the time also projected that Pinterest would end 2016 at 218 million monthly active users. The Wall Street Journal today also reported the company is expected to triple last year’s revenue to $300 million in 2016. That, too, falls below projected estimates of $663 million for 2016 from those leaked documents.
Again, these projections came in early 2015, and companies are constantly revising them as the years progress. Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann, in response to those projections, told The Wall Street Journal that “there were some early projections when we were just a couple months into building the business, but we’ve learned more about it.”
“Start up life is dynamic, and years old projections aren’t particularly relevant to where companies are today,” Andreessen-Horowitz partner Jeff Jordan, who is on Pinterest’s board, told TechCrunch. “We’re thrilled with Pinterest’s performance — strong continued user growth, best-in-class user engagement, and an increasingly robust platform for advertisers that’s leading to rapidly expanding revenue. We’re very excited about what’s to come.”
Revenue of $100 million for 2015, and potentially $300 million for 2016, are enviable numbers for a consumer ad-driven startup that’s only 7 years old. This isn’t really a reflection of poor performance for Pinterest, it would seem — just that the expectations may have been set a little high. Many startups are sometimes valued, to some extent, at a multiple of next year’s revenue. While Pinterest’s valuation is likely also relative to the latent pent-up marketing and user demand, as well as its growth and overhead, it would still seem the company needed to reset its expectations.

Last week, the company announced that it had brought on its first chief financial officer, former Twitter executive Todd Morgenfeld. But at that time, The Wall Street Journal reported that the company had generated $100 million in 2015, which fell below its projections of $169 million. To be sure, 50% growth year-over-year would be an enviable clip for any service with more than 100 million users (as in, Twitter), but there has always been a question as to what the upper bound of Pinterest would be beyond really powerful use cases like wedding planning or recipes.
There are a lot of potential reasons for this. With Facebook still immensely growing, scooping up new communications platforms and offering a wider array of advertising products, advertisers may be more inclined to simply stick to what they know. And the experimental budgets that these firms have, which previously may have gone to Pinterest, may be shifting to other emerging platforms like Snapchat, which has 150 million daily active users. Snapchat, a 5-year-old company, is already projecting revenue as high as between $500 million and $1 billion for 2017.
The souring on alternative platforms to Facebook and traditional advertising has been made increasingly apparent as Twitter’s valuation has dropped off a cliff. In recent weeks, reports came out that suitors have emerged (and slinked back, and emerged, and so on) to buy Twitter. That sent Twitter’s shares rocketing up, but it’s since cratered back to a market cap of around $12.5 billion. That’s not too far off from Pinterest’s valuation of $11 billion in its previous financing round.
Pinterest has increasingly offered an advertising tool that serves a larger funnel than other services. While Facebook — and likely Snapchat — are very effective at awareness and brand advertising, Pinterest has billed itself as a way for marketers to push users further and further toward conversion. It can get their attention at the awareness phase, their intention to purchase with search, and finally a conversion when they are pinning products or even purchasing them. For many kinds of products, particularly fashion, Pinterest is one of a very small set of marketing tools that touches users at every point in a purchasing life cycle.
That’s also why it’s been aggressively investing in tools surrounding visual search, including a tool that would allow users to search for products with photos from their smartphone cameras. Those sort of things are designed to capture the moment of an impulse purchase, increasingly offering alternative marketing products to its partners — and potentially to draw advertising dollars away from Facebook (or Snapchat).
In addition, Pinterest is also an online advertising service. Something like that might generally require little overhead, and to be sure, the company is generating a lot of revenue. It raised $553 million in its last financing round that valued it at $11 billion, so at face value it would appear that the company shouldn’t have any fear of running out of cash despite a lot of R&D investment and talent acquisitions — to go along with a healthy revenue stream.
What remains to be seen is whether this represents a more general trend for Pinterest. Will it being to see slowing user growth similar to Twitter, or more sustained gains like Facebook? The company’s international expansion appears to be going effectively, with 80 million of its users coming from outside the United States. There are of course different cultural quirks in different countries, but there’s clear demand for a service like Pinterest.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/pinterest-save-button.jpg?w=738,pinterest,"Pinterest hits 150M monthly users, missing earlier leaked projections in 2015"
19,Darrell Etherington,"Samsung is hoping to keep its customers with incentives, including a $100 credit for Note 7 owners who stick with a Samsung device as their replacement hardware. But carriers are leaving the door open for buyers to pick whatever kind of smartphone they want instead. A new survey conducted by e-commerce agency Branding Brand suggests that a decent number may end up moving to other brands, and Google’s new Pixel phones could get a sizeable early bump for its new premium approach to in-house designed hardware.
Of those surveyed, which include 1,000 Samsung smartphone owners (of any devices, not just the Note 7), has found that 40 percent of respondents won’t buy another device from the manufacturers, which represents a 6 percent increase in the number of buyers looking elsewhere compared to the first time Branding Brand ran this survey just after the first Note 7 recall.
Of that group, 8 percent of those planning a switch will buy a new Google Pixel (which wasn’t yet announced when the first survey was conducted), and 30 percent will switch to iPhone, with the remaining 62 percent saying they plan to go to another Android maker. Compared to the original survey, those considering iPhone dropped 4 percentage points, which means Pixel is looking like a legitimate premium competitor to some at least, alongside iPhone and Samsung’s top-tier hardware.
Pixel still represents a very small percentage of buyer choices in the survey, of course, but the fact that it’s tipping the scales at all already represents a kind of victory for Google and its marketing efforts around the device. I still don’t think Pixel will make a sizeable dent in the premium smartphone market this year, but Note 7 woes could help it make a stronger showing than it would have otherwise.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/pixel7.jpg?w=738,google-pixel,"Google Pixel to benefit from Samsung’s Note 7 brand damage, survey finds"
20,Josh Constine,"Periscope is embracing professional streaming and expanding beyond amateur content shot on phones with its new Periscope Producer feature. It allows creators to generate a special URL that they can then stream to from a wide array of devices, including professional cameras, studio editing rigs, satellite trucks, desktop streaming software like OBS, games, VR headsets, drones and later, potentially 360 cameras.
Periscope Producer is Twitter’s answer to Facebook’s Live API, which similarly allows news rooms, brands, web celebrities, app developers, and others to livestream to mobile and web users. The feature could help fill Periscope and Twitter with more polished content, filling the gap between off-the-cuff Periscope phone broadcasts, and the big licensing deals Twitter has struck with the NFL and other premium content makers.
Today Twitter will start offering Periscope Producer access to more creators who apply here, with availability on iOS now and Android coming soon. Eventually Periscope wants to roll it out to all streamers as well as provide an API for programmatically initiated broadcasts.

Check out our interview with Periscope CEO and co-founder Keyvon Beykpour about the potential for Periscope Producer and its impact on Twitter’s strategy above.
“We’re taking a big step towards allowing any live broadcast, captured on mobile or otherwise, to be piped into Periscope and vicariously Twitter” Periscope co-founder and CEO Kayvon Beykpour told reporters yesterday at Twitter HQ. When asked if Periscope might eventually serve ads on Producer-based streams or help creators monetize, Beykpour said “Periscope Producer is definitely laying the groundwork to do those explorations.”
Periscope Producer has been in testing for six weeks with launch partners like ABC’s Dancing with the Stars, CBS 12, Estadao, Fusion, Louis Vuitton, The News & Documentary Emmy Awards, Walt Disney Studios, XBox UK, and TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference. You can click these links to check out what they’ve created with the feature.
If you have Producer access, you’ll be able to go into your Periscope app’s profile settings, and in Additional Sources you can generate the streaming link you’ll enter into your professional equipment. Once your stream starts recording, you’ll see a preview in Periscope from which you can publish the stream publicly. Once a stream has started, you’ll have all the typical Periscope features, like visible replies from the audience, view counts, feedback hearts, and more. Tweets hosting Periscope videos can also be embedded on the web.

Periscope Producer won’t actually help make your video itself look more professional. It’s just a new pipe. But creative content makers using their own software or equipment can create overlaid graphics, swap in images or videos, take call-ins from Skype, stream from the first-person perspective of a VR headset, or use iOS ReplayKit to broadcast live gaming footage. Creators can even make their streams or games react to viewer comments or feedback. The Periscope team built a version of Flappy Bird that goes faster and gets harder as more viewers send hearts.
“We think this is the lowest common denominator to giving the most people access to this tool” Beykpour says about building Producer as a feature available in Periscope’s app rather than an API only more experienced developers can use. The streaming link method means anyone with a desktop streaming studio app like OBS can instantly broadcast through Producer with no coding skills necessary.
For example, bedroom web TV host Alex Pettit used Producer to show sponsorship reels, bring on Skype call-ins, and display overlaid graphics like you’d see on CNN.
 
Tyler Hansen used Producer to stream from a Mount Everest VR game.
TechCrunch has been testing Periscope Producer since September, and found it to be powerful and simple to use. There were a few issues, though. Periscope Producer streams get cropped into squares within embedded tweets, which can cut off the sides of the video as seen below. Longer streams can suffer since Producer doesn’t offer a way to republish tweets with the link, so you’d have to manually promote your stream during the broadcast after it drops down Twitter’s river.
Periscope will to prove the reach of Producer streams in order to attract broadcasters. The easier the set-up and the bigger the audience, the more creators who’ll be willing to syndicate video to Periscope or make content for its specifically. It will be competing with Facebook Live video, which can now be watched on televisions, and YouTube Live, which has close ties to creators.
Getting more broadcasts piped in is critical for Twitter at a time when live video is emerging as its best bet for success. It needs to demonstrate any long-term business potential it can right now as it’s accepting acquisition bids from Salesforce and possibly others. Rather than just being the second screen for television, Producer could bring that the best video content to Twitter so it can be the first screen too.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/periscope-producer.jpg?w=738,facebook-live,"Periscope Producer lets you stream to Twitter from pro cameras, apps, VR"
21,Lora Kolodny,"Song identifying app Shazam is rolling out music video channels to all of its 120 million monthly active users in a partnership with Vadio, a Portland-based startup. Through their partnership, whenever a user taps on the Shazam icon to identify a song, a thumbnail of the official music video for that track will display on the song’s Shazam page.
As we recently reported, the Shazam app has been downloaded over 1 billion times since the company was founded in 1999 and has finally become profitable.
Thankfully, the videos don’t just auto-play. A user has to click on the video thumbnail to make that happen. After the first video concludes, another relevant video will cross-fade in and begin playing through Vadio. Vadio shares a portion of its ad revenue with content creators but declined to discuss specific terms.
Something like a mashup of Outbrain and Vimeo, Vadio’s technology “ingests” premium video content, mostly music videos, distributes them and monetizes them with advertisements. Vadio CEO Bryce Clemmer said that Shazam and Vadio aim to “influence the discovery of new video content,” through this integration.
Vadio does not yet offer users an offline mode for bookmarking video channels to keep watching on the go, but Clemmer said the company is always working with partners to develop new features.
In a company statement, Shazam said the integration of Vadio is part of an effort to “give fans a great reason to spend more time with Shazam.”
Video channels within Vadio can be curated by editors, auto-generated using trending data, or built by marketers to reflect what they think are the interests of their targeted audiences. That means Shazam, or other platforms using Vadio, could extend a new type of creative unit, a video channel, to advertisers or artists on their platform.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/06_shazam_iphone_insitu_final.png?w=738,"shazam,music-videos,video,online-video",Shazam rolls out in-app music video channels with Vadio
22,Sarah Perez,"Tucked away inside Pandora’s rebranded app, launched yesterday, the company was hiding its first iMessage app, too. In fact, it’s the first third-party party streaming music service to launch its own iMessage extension, the company says.
That’s not to say it’s the only music-focused iMessage app, of course.
Apple Music already lets you share your favorite songs within iMessage, and Shazam recently launched a similar tool to both detect and send songs directly in iMessage.
However, Pandora’s app works a little differently.

Shazam and Apple Music’s iMessage extensions both point users to Apple Music and iTunes after a track preview is shared with the friend.
Meanwhile, Pandora’s app also lets you send a 30-second sample within a chat thread, but if the recipient likes the track, they can tap it to start a Pandora artist station based on that shared track instead.
The experience works better if both parties have the Pandora app installed, though the recipient doesn’t need to be logged in to hear the track (just start the station.)  And if the person you’re sharing with doesn’t have Pandora installed, they’ll be prompted to download it, the company notes.

Obviously, kicking of artist radio stations via a shared music clip isn’t as useful as being able to go directly to that artist and listen to their entire song, album, or catalog, as with an on-demand service. However, given that Pandora’s install base tops 78 million users, it’s more likely that your friends have Pandora on their phone rather than any other third-party music service, including Spotify, which has 40 million subscribers as of September, or even Apple Music, which announced at its iPhone 7 event that it had grown to 17 million subscribers.
In order to share songs, you simply launch the iMessage app while playing a Pandora station on your phone.
The current track will immediately pop up under “Now Playing” in the iMessage extension. Pandora’s curators will also handpick tracks that are good for sharing, including the current top hits and those that are trending.
As a bonus, the app includes a dozen stickers you can use to annotate your message. These are fairly basic – a thumbs up and thumbs down, a heart, lips, sad and happy emojis, and a few that say things like “Fire” or “Jam Alert,” among others.
There are also a couple of versions of the new Pandora logo included in the sticker pack. Why? Uh…because branding?
The iMessage extension arrived in yesterday’s app update, but like all iMessage apps, it only works if you’re running iOS 10.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/pandora-ios-icon.jpg?w=738,"pandora-radio,ios,imessage,pandora",Pandora’s new iMessage app lets you text your favorite music

24,Lora Kolodny,"Lyft has struck a landmark partnership with one of the largest operators of senior living facilities in the U.S., Brookdale Senior Living.
Through this partnership, Brookdale residents will be able to book a Lyft ride, on-demand or pre-scheduled via a concierge in their community, no smartphones or apps required. The rides will be billed to their rooms, and they won’t have to give out personal credit card information to book them.
According to Andrew Smith, Brookdale’s Director of Strategy and Innovation, Lyft’s app will also be included in tech education courses for seniors living in Brookdale communities. Seniors who do use smartphones, or web-enabled feature phones, will be able to learn how to book Lyft rides on their own from Brookdale tech educators.
The partnership is the latest indication of Lyft’s strategy to gain users in the massive, aging boomer demographic. Uber has pursued a similar strategy, partnering with cities to and senior groups and facilities within them to offer tech education and services.
In January, Lyft announced it was launching something called Concierge, a service that lets a “requester” book non-emergency medical transport for seniors.
Via Concierge, a requester puts in a passenger’s name, pick-up and drop-off locations and Lyft dispatches a driver with a vehicle that can accommodate their needs, including wheelchair-friendly vehicles.
Brookdale does run some transportation services of its own to take seniors on a regularly scheduled basis to shopping centers, museums and other cultural or social hubs, as well as medical appointments.
But Smith said Lyft will give residents more personal freedom in between those scheduled rides, and can help Brookdale tap into a network of Lyft drivers and avoid having to navigate all the mom and pop transportation services in every market where they operate.
Brookdale is currently facing a False Claims Act lawsuit filed by a nurse, Marjorie Prather,  who previously worked there alleging $35 million worth of Medicare billing fraud. The case was recently reopened by the U.S. Court of Appeals after previous dismissals.
The Lyft service is currently being piloted at 10 Brookdale communities around the San Francisco Bay Area and Phoenix, Arizona.
If it proves a success, Brookdale will consider expanding it across their 1,114 facilities across 47 states, where more than 100,000 seniors live today.
Both companies are slated to discuss innovation and technology design for and with seniors at the Aging 2.0 OPTIMIZE conference in San Francisco on Friday October 14th.
Aging 2.0 seeks to improve the lives of older adults through media and events that bring senior care professionals together with tech entrepreneurs, and connect both to senior communities who can inform the design of their products and services.

25,Josh Constine,"Tribe’s voice recognition video chat technology could make Snapchat and Facebook Messenger look outdated. That tech also attracted a $3 million seed round led by prestigious VC Sequoia, its first seed investment of the year.
Today, Tribe’s one-touch video walkie-talkie app launches a huge Version 2 update on iOS and Android powered by access to some unreleased Google voice APIs. You still hold down on a friend or group’s tile to send them a short, asynchronous video message, but now Tribe automatically adds subtitles to your video chats. And if it recognizes you’ve said a “Magic Word,” Tribe will offer a helpful related link.
Say “coffee” and Tribe offers a button to send a calendar request overlaid on your video chat. Say a celebrity’s name and it will link to their social media accounts. Products link to Amazon, locations link to maps and songs playing in the background link to Spotify.
Cyril Paglino, CEO and founder of Tribe, calls this “augmented messaging.” He built the features because, he says, “I want Tribe to be the most convenient app for me and my friends.”

Now the question is whether these features are enough to pull people away from the standard messaging apps they use, like iMessage, Facebook Messenger and Snapchat. Those all do video, but Tribe wants to make the format the default way people communicate, with text just for when you have to be quiet or share details people need to copy.
Tribe already has 500,000 downloads since its founding in August 2015, and now has 40,000 daily users. It built that community on a meager $500,000 seed round from Ludlow Ventures raised last November. But with the new cash secured in May from Sequoia, plus Ludlow, Partech Ventures and Kima Ventures, Tribe is ready to challenge the world’s most powerful chat apps. And if it doesn’t work out, I’m sure one of the tech giants would be happy to scoop up this product team.

“Professional breakdancer” isn’t on the résumé of most startup founders, but that was actually how Paglino got the idea for Tribe. While signed with Red Bull’s dance team, he traveled across Europe making friends. But trying to keep up with them all over text messengers like WhatsApp was too slow. You can’t type as fast as you can think on mobile. But you can talk.
After building and selling a startup called Wizee in his home of France, Paglino realized he could create an app to solve his typing problem. With Tribe, instead of mashing out long text messages, you simply hold down on the screen, record a video message and it’s instantly sent to friends. Paglino teamed up with some buddies, rented a hacker house in San Francisco’s secluded Dolores Heights for them to live and work from and pushed out the MVP of their app in December.
Tribe is still video first, but it’s also adding a text option just in case you need to send someone something they’ll want to copy and paste, like a phone number or address. Tribe is also branching out from just being for personal contacts to allow Telegram-style public rooms. For now you’ll have to watch every video left in the room, in order, but the startup is building feedback and ranking features to algorithmically show you the best ones first.
But the big new feature, Magic Words, could be the key to monetizing messaging without annoying its users. Affiliate links to Amazon are one obvious way Tribe could make money. There are also opportunities for tie-ins with other apps, like pushing people to certain ride-sharing services. Paglino imagines that one day you might use Tribe to get per-minute legal advice or telemedicine from a doctor.
The first step is mass traction, though, which could be difficult when everyone’s social graphs are already established on other apps. Tribe does let you pull in your Facebook friends, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Facebook cut off access for competing with it, which it’s done to messaging apps in the past. Video might be more vivid and less taxing on your thumbs, but not everything needs a face behind it, and utilitarian chat platforms could feel easier than Tribe.
What Tribe is betting on is that the shift to video will upend these chat apps like iMessage, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp that are essentially desktop IRC programs ported to mobile. And with Snapchat’s increased focus on broadcasting of Stories instead of private messaging, and the failure of Taptalk, there’s a huge open space.
Tribe and Sequoia think that gap can be filled with a video walkie-talkie that doesn’t just let you talk instead of type, but actually understands what you’re saying.
Tribe 2.0 already has one loyal user: Paglino’s mom, who’s deaf. Thanks to the subtitles, she can still see the face of her son and video chat with him even though he’s far away in Silicon Valley, chasing his dream.",2016-10-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/tribe-video-chat.png?w=738,"video-chat,tribe",Tribe augments video chat with speech recognition subtitles and suggested links
26,Frederic Lardinois,"With Android Experiments, Google is giving itself the freedom to experiment with quirky little apps that show off some interesting technologies but don’t really have any other real purpose. The latest of these experimental projects is Sprayscape, a VR camera app for Android that is probably not quite what you expect when you read the words “VR camera app.”

Unlike similar apps, including Google’s own Cardboard Camera, Sprayscape doesn’t simply capture a 360-degree sphere. “Just point your phone and tap the screen to spray faces, places, or anything else onto your canvas,” is how Google describes it.
When you first try the app, it’s not immediately obvious that you shouldn’t keep your finger on the screen as you move around. All that will give you is a very blurry image. It’s all a bit weird, but oddly fun, too.
Once you’ve captured your 360-degree photo collage, you can share your photos with the rest of the world via a link.
The app uses the Cardboard SDK to read gyroscope data and the NatCam Unity plugin to control the camera. Google has published the app’s code on GitHub, so if you want to build a similar app, you can use Google’s code to see how it’s done.
If you want to give it a try, you can download the app here.

27,Sarah Perez,"A startup called Shine is rolling out a new service offering on-demand life coaching via text messages as a paid tier to its free, daily texting service. While a number of today’s chatbots and SMS-based concierge services have been focused on helping people shop via text message, Shine to date has instead focused on helping you become a better person. Through automated texts, Shine delivers daily self-help, encouragement, and advice to its subscribers, via either SMS or Facebook Messenger.
With the debut of Shinevisor, it’s preparing to introduce a more personal touch: advice and guidance from real people, who are certified life, career, and school coaches.
Launched into beta roughly a year ago, Shine’s free service is largely targeted toward a millennial audience. Every day, it sends out an automated text that tackles life’s struggles. For example, recent texts I’ve received from Shine have delved into subjects like facing criticism, trying to let go of the need to exert control over everything, overcoming procrastination, practicing patience, learning self-compassion, and so on.
Many of the texts are particularly tuned into issues you would face at work, and in particular those that women deal with in their careers. As co-founder Naomi Hirabayashi explained at last year’s launch, half of women report having experiences with self-doubt about their performance and careers, compared with 31% of men. Shine wants to address that.
Each Shine text starts of with an introduction to the day’s subject, which you can respond to by texting back “M” (for more). Shine then sends additional insight, including the why’s and how’s of the issue and hand, as well as further reading via web links.
As of this summer, the service had sent out over 2.8 million messages to a user base that’s almost entirely (88%) under the age of 35. Today, that number has grown to 10 million messages, to an audience that’s 70% women.

Now, Shine is experimenting with the next phase of its business: personal, one-on-one coaching. Through Shinevisor, users are connected with a certified coach they can text any time.
According to messages recently sent out to early Shine users, a number of members have been asking for the ability to talk to a real person for advice on work, school and life.
These advisors and coaches are first vetted by Shine before being connected to users. They have to have accreditation from a formal coaching program, many are referred through the Dreamers // Doers community for entrepreneurial women, and they receive virtual training to make sure their coaching is on-brand in terms of Shine’s voice, energy and personality.
The cost for this service is not cheap, however. Shinevisor is a fairly steep $15.99 per week (billed on a 12-week basis). That’s nearly as costly as the co-pay at a therapist (for those with health insurance), even though it isn’t like having an in-person session.
Instead, this real-world life coach will listen to your venting, your problems, and your life goals, via text, then write back with customized advice, feedback, and guidance. They’ll also send articles on the subject, so you can learn more about whatever it is you’re facing. Paid members are guaranteed at least one texting session per day, and the messages are sent asynchronously.
“We’re meeting people where they are in terms of the platform – which is on the go,” explains Hirabayashi. “So you can text your coach at any time, and they’ll get back to you when they’re able, and vice versa. So it’s a fluid conversation, versus the traditional coaching that’s a set session,” she says.
Traditional life coaching can clock in as high as $250-300 for an hour-long session, Hirabayashi adds, explaining how Shine aims to offer a lower cost competitor.
It should be interesting to see if Shine is actually able to convert its young users to this level of paid, on-demand coaching, however. After all, there’s so much free support available online – ranging from blogs and websites to email newsletters to private Facebook support groups and more.
Shinevisor, meanwhile, falls somewhere in between those looking for free advice, and those who are committed to seriously tackling problems through therapy or real-world mentorship.
The new service, still in beta, is currently being pitched via text to select Shine users, but is also available via the company website, where you can sign up for a free trial.",2016-10-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-12-at-11-47-09-am.png?w=738,"text-messaging,texting,shine",Shine is rolling out on-demand life coaching via text message
28,Lora Kolodny,"Remember those old school chemistry sets that came in a cardboard box with a bunch of vials, plastic beakers, safety glasses and a booklet full of instructions for different experiments?
London startup MEL Science is putting a high-tech twist on them, with virtual reality and augmented reality content that takes kids on a virtual tour inside a chemical reaction, right after they conduct an experiment in the real world.
The startup has raised $2.5 million in Series A funding from Sistema Venture Capital to grow their subscription commerce and VR content business.
Subscribers to MEL Science get two new chemistry sets by snail mail each month for $49 each. The kits are now selling in the U.K., U.S. and Russia.
The MEL Science app shows a 3-D model of glucose.
The experiments in the kit work along with the MEL mobile app, available for iOS and Android devices, and a Google Cardboard VR headset that the company provides in its introductory kit.
The app was designed to enhance kids’ understanding of what’s happening in a given experiment, with 3D graphics, macro photos and videos of molecules up-close.
According to MEL Science CEO and founder Vassili Philippov, he decided to start the company after conducting science experiments to entertain and educate his own kids at home.
After they used tin chloride and zinc to grow a “crystal hedgehog,” his kids were clamoring for more information about what caused the crystals to grow so quickly. He turned to YouTube, and myriad educational sites, but couldn’t find good content that would show kids more about what was happening on the molecular level during this chemical reaction.
The entrepreneur said IT and physics were always dueling passions for him. MEL Science allows him to bring those together.
Philippov previously co-founded SPB Software, a developer of mobile games, apps and mobile OS shells, which was acquired by Yandex in 2011.
Sistema VC’s Dimitry Filatov said he expects MEL Science to use its new funding to develop more VR content, kits and curriculum for use both in schools and at home.
MEL Science is currently sold direct to consumers, and typically parents or grandparents are buying a subscription as a gift for science-curious kids. Subscriptions are also popular among families that homeschool their kids.

29,Matthew Lynley,"Dropbox is still working its way through the enterprise world in order to show the world it isn’t just dumb online storage — which, given as simple as it was to use, was one of the tool’s original top selling points.
So it’s had to shift gears in order to focus on larger companies, and that means consistently rolling out new tools that companies need as they start to expand. And that also means that Dropbox has to keep pace with the rest of the market. So today, to do that, the company is updating its apps with a few new features that should help it continue to have a toehold within larger companies.
“I think overall our approach is, let’s work well extensively across all platforms,” Matt Pan, group product manager for Dropbox’s File Collaboration Product Group said. “We know workplaces increasingly have a set of heterogeneous tools, not just at a platform level like a bunch of people using Mac and Windows. A lot of people have very mixed environments where some people use Office, whether you’re Adobe users or the long tail. Dropbox making all those things tied together in a really simple way has been very much the key to success in the workplace.”
So, here’s a quick rundown of the things that Dropbox is rolling out today:
The first update is PDF signing, which allows users to open PDF files right from their mobile devices and insert signatures and text into them. It seems simple enough, but this is actually a pretty big pain point for a lot of companies that need to get approval for projects and want to keep the ball rolling quickly.
Another update Dropbox is getting today is an integration with iMessage. When Apple opened up iMessage to third-party developers, it became clear to the company that it would have to address the service’s usage within businesses, which was very common, Pan said. So the company is rolling out more rich file-sharing within iMessage that includes previews and the like for its users.
“For workplace communications in a meaningful way we’re seeing [a lot of iMessage use] with small or medium businesses, especially for medium companies — larger companies might be a little stricter with what kind of tools users use,” Pan said. “Within SMBs, we see iMessage used pretty significantly — especially desktop — and for people who have a primarily mobile workforce, like when you have kind of a big real estate team.”
The company is also rolling out a lock-screen widget that will give users the ability to do the most common actions you might find in a Dropbox app from the lock screen. Tapping on one of the functions will go straight to an operation within Dropbox. While this idea might seem useful, Dropbox is still going to have to deal with the constant uphill battle for real estate on that lock screen to ensure that users aren’t getting a cluttered screen and simply ignoring it.
Later this year, the company is adding split-screen usage on the iPad, so users can have the Dropbox app open while surfing through other services. The strongest use case likely still has to be determined here, but there are some natural ones — like viewing a video while still operating the Dropbox app.
The last one is that Dropbox is enabling a picture-in-picture environment on the iPad that allows users to have a video going while they continue to work, similar in the way to YouTube users having a video playing at the bottom-right corner while they are searching for a new video.
All these additions can at times seem incremental (though some, including a literal document scanner through your phone camera, less so), but they’re all an effort to essentially keep pace with the rest of the tools available in the market. Not only does Dropbox have to contend with Box, which started with enterprise customers in the first place, it has to deal with other services like Google Docs, as well. And it seems clear that Salesforce is looking to increasingly get into collaboration services after buying Quip for $750 million.
The company has around 500 million registered users and 200,000 paying customers, it says. While its previous valuation hit as high as $10 billion, there are certainly going to be questions as to whether the traditionally consumer product will be able to pick up steam in the corporate world. Dropbox is banking — including with this update today — that focusing on simplicity and ease of use will give it an edge over those other competitors.

30,Sarah Perez,"Apple has unveiled its own official measurements for iOS 10 adoption, which comes in at 54 percent. That means the majority of iOS device owners are running the new mobile operating system. What’s interesting, however, is how different Apple’s official figures are from the third-party estimates released earlier this week, which saw much higher adoption among their install base – as high as two-thirds, in fact.
According to two different sources – Mixpanel and Fiksu – iOS 10 was installed on roughly 66 percent of devices, the firms found. Both data sets are based on apps that use the company’s SDK. In Fiksu’s case, the company reports data sampled hourly in batches of approximately 10 million events, filtered to count unique devices; Mixpanel, meanwhile, claims its reported is “generated from  300,083,243,931 records.” This equates to a sample size of hundreds of millions of unique users, Mixpanel tells us.
In Apple’s case, however, it calculates iOS adoption rates by App Store visits. That’s a more accurate means of making a determination, as it doesn’t require that users have an app installed on their device running a specific SDK from a third-party.

According to Apple’s data, 54 percent are now on iOS 10, 38 percent remain on iOS 9, and only 8 percent are running an older version of the iOS mobile operating system.
Also of note, we’ve confirmed that Apple did not prompt users to upgrade their devices for the first two weeks the iOS update was available – a delay that was spotted in the charts from the third-party firms, as well. Adoption rates spiked sharply toward the end of September, which is when the alert notifications started hitting users’ devices.
The decision to delay the upgrade notifications was made to ease the strain on Apple’s infrastructure and its Apple Care support teams, we understand. This is the first time Apple has implemented a new policy of delaying the upgrade notifications in order to allow for a smoother, if slower, iOS rollout. After the initial rush of upgrade activity died down, only then did the company begin to alert users who had not yet updated that an upgrade was available to them.
Despite this delay to notify users, now more than half the active user base moved to iOS 10. For comparison’s sake, Android 7.0 “Nougat,” which arrived several weeks ahead of iOS 10, is only installed on 0.1 percent of devices. The prior release, Android 6.0 “Marshmallow,” is still present on 18.7 percent of devices, and other previous versions still have a good chunk of the overall pie as well.

In part, this is because Android updates are handled by the manufacturers and carriers, not Google directly, in most cases. This has historically been a huge issue for Google, not only because of security reasons, but also because it fragments the ecosystem, and makes it difficult for Google to get its entire install base using the same features and tools. Even with its new flagship Pixel phones, Google is allowing Verizon to handle all system updates, except for security patches, the company says.",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_8790.jpg?w=738,,"According to Apple’s official figures, iOS 10 adoption rate now at 54%"
31,Lora Kolodny,"VenueNext Inc. has raised $15 million in Series B funding to bring its venue management technology to Europe, and beyond the live entertainment industry.
Among other things, using VenueNext apps, people can wave their mobile tickets at the gate to get into a game or concert, order food, drinks or merchandise to be delivered to their seats, and get information and amenities that they need when they are in the venue.
The SAP Center in San Jose, home to the NHL’s San Jose Sharks, is the most recent major venue to adopt VenueNext for the 2016-2017 hockey season.
The Sharks join a long list of sports teams and venues to adapt VenueNext. The app will be familiar to anyone who has recently attended a game, concert or races at: Yankee Stadium, Churchill Downs, Minnesota Vikings’ U.S. Bank Stadium, Dallas Cowboys’ AT&T Stadium, Belmont Park & Saratoga Springs, and the San Francisco 49ers’ Levi’s Stadium, where it debuted.
Founded in 2013, VenueNext originally spun out of the San Francisco 49ers Stadium Technology group at a time when stadiums were investing in improved wi-fi for attendees, and beginning to favor mobile over paper-based tickets.
Causeway Media Partners led the $15 million Series B round in VenueNext, joined by food service giants Compass Group Plc, and Sharks Sports & Entertainment, along with other unnamed investors. In 2015, the company raised a $9 million Series A round. 
While VenueNext has found its early traction with stadiums and theme parks, the company’s founder, John Paul reports that hotels and hospitals are also signing up to use the app, at this point.
“In a venue, we want to improve your guest or fan experience, through your smartphone. For the venue operators, we’re helping them improve their business through real time data that we collect about who is in the building and what they are doing during an event or their visit,” he said.
One feature of VenueNext’s platform that sports organizations like, Paul said, is a ticket “forwarding” feature. This allows a ticketholder to easily give a ticket, via mobile, to friends or family when they can’t attend.
Venues can begin to know when, for example, season ticketholders attended games themselves or when they handed off tickets bringing new fans to the venue.
In some cases, VenueNext allows ticketholders to sell their unused tickets back to a team. The team can re-sell the ticket. And the original buyer gets credit to spend during their next visit to the stadium on things like a seat upgrade, a locker room tour, or food and beverages.
Sharks Sports & Entertainment COO John Tortora tells TechCrunch that his organization does not typically invest in tech startups but did so because of VenueNext’s potential, positive impact to the industry.
Tortora said, “VenueNext should help us drive greater revenue around ticket sales and food and beverage, and to deliver the best possible customer service. We also think ticket forwarding and mobile ticketing reduces the risk of ticket fraud. We faced that issue during the Stanley Cup finals.”
With the new round of venture funding, VenueNext aims to expand beyond the U.S., namely into Europe. Longer-term, it also intends to help venues and campuses make use of emerging technology from augmented reality to delivery drones.",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/san_jose_sharks_and_pittsburgh_penguins_shaking_hands.jpg?w=738,venuenext,VenueNext raises $15 million to take its app beyond U.S. sports stadiums
32,Devin Coldewey,"It’s a funny thing: Smartwatches are supposed to be the more accessible alternative to your smartphone, but you can operate a phone with one hand, while the watch takes two. Luckily, Dartmouth researchers are on the case, and have engineered a way to use your wrist as a sort of joystick, allowing you to use your smartwatch one-handed.
It’s a very hacky project; this isn’t some custom app running on an Apple Watch. Xing-Dong Yang and his colleagues built their own smartwatch with a 2″ display, a wristband and a dozen infrared proximity sensors. The WristWhirl prototype is literally duct-taped together.

The proximity sensors monitor how far away the bits of your hand are, collating that information into a larger picture of the position of your wrist. This data is sent instantly to the watch, where it drives a virtual cursor. Tilting your hand down moves the cursor down, and so on.
Tilt in a pattern to launch or switch apps, scroll up and down and play games, all without using that second hand of yours. And it only detects gestures when you want it to: another sensor detects the sound made when you tap your thumb and index finger together (!), which turns the recognition software on and off.

There are already gyros and accelerometers in smart watches, but having to move the watch around when you want to zoom in on a map seems pretty weak, especially once you’ve seen WristWhirl in action.
Will you look insane flipping your wrist around while staring at your watch? Yes. But onlookers will soon know the convenience of this form of input and it will become mainstream. Remember how we used to look at people talking into Bluetooth headsets? (Actually, we still look at them that way.)
Now, I don’t think anyone was really hurting for lack of being able to use their smartwatch while carrying groceries (shades of Everything is Terrible in the video) — but this is still a clever solution. Of course, the thing looks like a bomb at present, so it’s not quite ready for deployment. But a future version could easily be much smaller, and, really, developers would have a field day. It’s very futuristic.

33,Darrell Etherington,"In the latest instalment of Samsung’s ongoing Note 7 saga, the U.S. Department of Transportation has issued an official, blanket ban against bringing the Galaxy Note 7 on airplanes. The ban applies to all Note 7 devices, and covers both carry-on and checked baggage, as well as prohibiting anyone from carrying the phone onto a plane on their person. The ban will go into effect beginning October 15 at 12 PM ET.
U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx issued the following statement in a press release announcing the ban:
The Galaxy Note 7 has been officially recalled by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, so theoretically all Note 7 owners should be returning the phone anyway. But this new blanket ban means passengers can no longer even transport a Note 7 on a plane (perhaps to the place where they originally purchased it), and face the penalty of a potential fine if they attempt to do so, or even “criminal prosecution,” according to the DOT.
Samsung will be fielding requests about how best to return Note 7s, the release notes, and customs can look for more info on their recall support site, or contact them directly via their customer support number at 1-844-365-6197 if the flight ban leaves them in a lurch.
A flight ban is likely the only course of action that can guarantee incidents related to the Note 7 don’t occur in the future, given that the replacement Note 7 which caught fire on a Southwest Flight last week wasn’t even powered on when it began to smoke, and subsequently burned through the cabin’s carpeting. The blanket ban won’t do Samsung’s brand any favors, however, and it’s now more likely than ever that the Note sub-brand won’t survive this ongoing ordeal.
A Samsung spokesperson provided the following statement to TechCrunch regarding the ban:",2016-10-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/p8112360.jpg?w=738,,U.S. Department of Transportation bans Galaxy Note 7 from all flights
34,Romain Dillet,"Apple is on a research & development spree! The company has announced a bunch of new R&D centers over the past few months, and R&D spendings have skyrocketed. This time, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the company plans to open a new center in Japan during a visit in Tokyo, according to Xinhua.
This isn’t the first time we’re hearing about a new R&D center in Japan. Previous reports have indicated that Apple was building a new R&D center for 2016 or 2017.
Cook met with Japan’s prime minister Shinzo Abe to discuss all things Apple and Japan. Later at a press conference, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga reported that Apple would complete its R&D center in December.
So what is this R&D center anyway? Located in Yokohama, the building used to be a Panasonic factory. Apple has taken over the building and transformed it into an R&D center.
This way, Apple can more easily hire talented Japanese engineers. It’s unclear what the Japanese team is going to work on.
Overall, in addition to existing R&D centers, Apple will soon have R&D centers in Shenzhen, Israel, the U.K., France, Japan and Sweden. Maybe it’s time to rethink Apple’s tagline on all of its products — “designed by Apple in Cupertino and many other countries.”

35,Darrell Etherington,"Consumer virtual reality has a clear new leader today, and it’s the just-launched PlayStation VR. Unequivocally, this is the best VR experience currently available outside of the kinds of high-flying, super-secret test rigs that exist out there for army training or whatever that cost millions of dollars. That includes top-of-line hardware like HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, as well as smartphone standouts like Samsung Gear VR.
I own the HTC Vive, and I’m not abandoning it by any means. I also have and use Gear VR, and I’m excited to explore Daydream VR further, after getting a small taste of it at Google’s Pixel launch event. And if you’re looking for an assessment of which VR hardware you, personally, should buy, Lucas has that covered with his roundup. But despite all of that, it’s clear to me that PlayStation VR is the new gold standard when it comes to consumer VR, and could go a long way to proving that the technology is accessible and viable for everyday users.
Is PSVR perfect? Not at all — the visual fidelity and room-scale VR are both better on my HTC Vive. Plus, it doesn’t have the wireless freedom you get from Gear VR. I’ve even noticed some tracking issues where the PlayStation camera seems to lose sight of the headset temporarily, leading to disorienting jitters in the immersive experience.

But what PlayStation VR offers is simplicity — from setup, to calibration, to actual use, the experience is very similar to what you’ve experienced before setting up any new console. It’s definitely due partly to having gone through the process of setting up much more complicated systems, including Vive, but unboxing and using PSVR consistently results in a “that’s it?” response from my brain, which is tuned to expect more hassle leading up to the actual VR stuff itself.
Simplicity alone isn’t enough, however, and the PSVR manages the right balance between simple and powerful, giving an end-user experience that’s as likely to wow the average person as is a high-end Vive or SteamVR game, but without the high-end technical requirements or comfort level with tech.
The other reason PlayStation VR wins is because of game selection. At launch, the game library is impressive already, and the best part of it is that all the experiences deserve to be there. Not all of them are necessarily amazing, but all the ones I’ve tried have impacted my overall opinion of VR for the better. That’s definitely not true of everything I’ve tried on the Vive, or on Gear VR.
If PSVR has a significant remaining issue, it’s that it’s still too expensive; despite not reaching the stratospheric pricing of Vive or Oculus, especially when you factor in the cost of the PC, PlayStation VR’s price tag is likely too high to attract much of a crowd beyond the core gamer group. But it’ll live in households where it’s much more likely to be exposed to a range of different kinds of users, which is exactly what VR needs right now.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/playstation-vr.jpg?w=738,playstation-vr,PlayStation VR is easily the winner in virtual reality right now
36,Devin Coldewey,"“Index… ring… pinky… index… middle…”
Nathan Copeland is telling a researcher which of his fingers he feels a touch on. But the researcher is touching a robotic hand, not Copeland’s, whose hand hasn’t felt a thing in over a decade.
In this “proof of principle” experiment, a man whose spinal injury removed all sensation from his limbs was able to “feel” pressure on several robotic digits connected directly to his brain. It’s a long way from a cybernetic hand, but it opens the possibility of using one to even more of those who need it.

That said, this is still important research because it skips a step many other prosthetics rely on: the peripheral nervous system. If you need to send signals from a replacement hand, you can often plug in further up the arm, tapping in where those signals would have gone anyway. But with a spinal injury, those signals never reach the brain, so that approach doesn’t work.
What Robert Gaunt and his team at the University of Pittsburgh have done is essentially plug the robotic arm directly into the brain, bypassing the intermediary nerves and spinal cord altogether.
Copeland was in an accident 12 years ago that left him a quadriplegic. But 16 years of operating his limbs means he remembers what it feels like when his hand is touched — and that means his brain remembers, too.
So the researchers had Copeland concentrate on the feeling of having different fingers touched, and tracked the brain activity associated with that feeling. Then they surgically implanted four sets of fingertip-sized microelectrode arrays into Copeland’s sensory cortex, where those feelings were centered.
Over the next few months the team repeatedly stimulated those areas of the brain, finding the patterns and locations that produced the sensation of being touched on the index finger, ring finger and so on. Eventually, Copeland was hooked up to a robotic hand, each finger of which corresponded to the circuit in his brain.
He got 85 percent right at first, then later nearly 100 percent. This is highly validating, although everyone involved will tell you how early this is.
“The ultimate goal is to create a system which moves and feels just like a natural arm would,” Gaunt said in a UP news release. “We have a long way to go to get there, but this is a great start.”
For one thing, the sensation needs to be evened out — “sometimes it feels electrical and sometimes it’s pressure, but for the most part, I can tell most of the fingers with definite precision,” Copeland said. The many gradations and types of touch are miles off.
This is also a one-way street: No data is being passed from the brain to the arm. Control methods would rely on completely different neural circuitry, in the motor cortex; it’s a whole different field of research. But this kind of feedback, going straight from the prosthetic to the brain, is important for intuitive controls that allow a user to grip and manipulate things in a natural way.
The team’s work is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. It was funded through DARPA, the US Department of Veteran’s affairs and several other grants.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/copeland_hand.jpg?w=738,"prosthetics,cybernetics,neuroscience,brain-computer-interface",Brain-computer interface lets a man with a spinal injury feel robotic fingers
37,John Biggs,"Samsung is on the ropes. It pains me to say it but the Note 7 fiasco is probably going to hurt them more deeply than they’ll admit and I suspect we’ll see two or three quarters of slow growth thanks to Explode-gate.
It’s bad.
Consider the damage done to the brand. Pilots were telling users not to turn on their Note 7 phones as they taxied for takeoff. A total recall is now making everyone think their Samsung phones can explode at any time. The damage these exploding batteries did is complete. I’ve never seen so many burnt phones in one news cycle and, as evidenced by the plethora of Note 7 posts that followed the phone from fan darling to Public Enemy Number One, Samsung’s sales this quarter are going to take a hit.
The bottom line? Samsung lost a lot of money and a lot of brand loyalty. As Natasha Lomas writes, “analysts [are] estimating that a permanent end to Note 7 sales could cost the company up to $17 billion.” They’re even thinking of retiring the arguably clever Note name. This mess could mean the end of the dual Samsung/Apple rivalry, opening the market to new devices like the Google Pixel.
To be clear, it will be hard to knock Samsung off its perch. According to Statista Samsung sold 77 million phones in Q2 2016. This is a strong showing but down from their peak in Q1 2014 of 88 million. In Q1 2016 they owned 27.8% market share compared to Apple’s 14.4%.
The problem is that Samsung left the door open to other Android competitors. While there are few that can match its manufacturing and marketing might I assure you that none of them will ignore this opportunity to try to push cheaper and ostensibly better phones to Samsung consumers. Manufacturers like OnePlus and Xiaomi can easily step in and take over chunks of the market until Samsung is as popular or, more correctly, as unpopular, as Motorola or HTC.

The exploding Notes were a fluke. All told there was the potential for about 1,000 fiery phones out of the millions Samsung sold. But even one fiery phone on a bed stand or Jeep or plane is enough to scare consumers. Look what faulty batteries did to the hoverboard craze.
Samsung’s competitors are scrambling. Apple has just refreshed its iPhone line and we can expect an event later this month. In short, the deck is stacked against Seoul and it now has lots of explaining to do. Imagine the marketing problem: rather than crowing about being the best phone in the business now Samsung has to convince the world that their next phone (and their next and their next) won’t explode in your hand.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/screen-shot-2015-09-22-at-9-30-24-am.png?w=738,"samsung-electronics,business",Could this be the end of Samsung’s smartphone reign?
38,Darrell Etherington,"Samsung is hoping to keep its customers with incentives, including a $100 credit for Note 7 owners who stick with a Samsung device as their replacement hardware. But carriers are leaving the door open for buyers to pick whatever kind of smartphone they want instead. A new survey conducted by e-commerce agency Branding Brand suggests that a decent number may end up moving to other brands, and Google’s new Pixel phones could get a sizeable early bump for its new premium approach to in-house designed hardware.
Of those surveyed, which include 1,000 Samsung smartphone owners (of any devices, not just the Note 7), has found that 40 percent of respondents won’t buy another device from the manufacturers, which represents a 6 percent increase in the number of buyers looking elsewhere compared to the first time Branding Brand ran this survey just after the first Note 7 recall.
Of that group, 8 percent of those planning a switch will buy a new Google Pixel (which wasn’t yet announced when the first survey was conducted), and 30 percent will switch to iPhone, with the remaining 62 percent saying they plan to go to another Android maker. Compared to the original survey, those considering iPhone dropped 4 percentage points, which means Pixel is looking like a legitimate premium competitor to some at least, alongside iPhone and Samsung’s top-tier hardware.
Pixel still represents a very small percentage of buyer choices in the survey, of course, but the fact that it’s tipping the scales at all already represents a kind of victory for Google and its marketing efforts around the device. I still don’t think Pixel will make a sizeable dent in the premium smartphone market this year, but Note 7 woes could help it make a stronger showing than it would have otherwise.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/pixel7.jpg?w=738,google-pixel,"Google Pixel to benefit from Samsung’s Note 7 brand damage, survey finds"

41,Devin Coldewey,"Robotic exoskeletons are one of those technologies that tend to be associated with warfare or at least the industrial sector, but soft robotics and artificial muscles like these ones created by Swiss researchers make them suitable for more delicate operations as well.

Alone, they look like weird little worms. But by packing these actuators into bundles, the researchers have made simple robots that act as a credible analogue to human muscles.
Sure, you could use them to create super-strong workers or punching machines, but the Swiss aren’t like us. They’re taking a more humanitarian path.

“We are working with physical therapists from the University Hospital of Lausanne who are treating stroke victims,” said EPFL’s Matthew Robertson in a university news release.

42,Matt Burns,"A few days ago we revealed an automotive product from Anker called Roav. At the time, it seemed the Roav was an in-vehicle heads-up display that looked a lot like the Navdy. Today, Anker reached out with additional details.
Roav, when it launches in November, will be Anker’s automotive brand, with the Roav Dashtop as the flagship product.
Anker tells TechCrunch the Roav Dashtop connects to the vehicle and driver’s smartphone and displays relevant information from both such as gas level, navigation details, caller information, and thanks to a 4G connection, traffic information. The device also connects to dash and rear cams, which will alert the driver, through the HUD, of physical objects around the vehicle.
The device seems to be controlled through voice commands and a controller mounted on the steering wheel.

The Roav Dashtop still feels like a clone of Navdy’s device. The core functions are similar and the design is similar in look and feel, though with the addition of cameras and cellular connectivity, the Roav Dashtop could have more functions. And according to an image provided to us by Anker, the Dashtop looks to have an app store of sorts.
Anker says the Roav Dashtop will be available starting in November and, shortly before the release, the company will make an official announcement with a complete list of product details and specs.",2016-10-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-12-at-1-28-10-pm.png?w=738,anker,"Anker reveals details about its upcoming automotive brand, Roav"
43,John Biggs,"Skagen is a Danish watch company famous for its minimalist designs and affordable prices. Now, for $215, you can add a little smarts to your minimalist wrist, a welcome bit of news for those who think the flat black slab of an Apple Watch is too flamboyant.
The Skagen Hagen is basically an activity watch similar to the Withings Activite and the watches containing smart movements from MMT. The watch can measure your steps and sleep patterns and vibrates when you get a notification on your phone. The battery lasts four to six months and you can easily swap it out for a new one by opening the back case.
Why is this watch interesting? First it’s surprisingly light. Made of titanium this particular piece could pass for a modern minimalist mechanical. Skagen also has a steel version on a mesh strap and a rose gold model but this one is the nicest, I think. The three buttons on the side control the various functions including music playback on your phone or other device. The sub-dial at nine o’clock displays the percentage of steps taken and a separate iOS or Android app lets you see your progress.
The Skagen Hagen is a really nice watch. As a timepiece I’m quite pleased with the soft leather band and handsome case. As an activity tracker I could see it replacing a non heart-rate-sensing Fitbit in, well, a heartbeat. This is also not Fossil’s first smartwatch effort. I still have their original Palm watch – an amazing little bit of technology – and they’ve been mucking about with Android Wear over the past few months as well. This sort of watch – pared down, simple, and usable – is just another arrow in their smartwatch quiver.
For $215 the Hagen is a pretty solid deal. It doesn’t do much, but if you’re primarily interested in your steps and some minor notification controls then this does exactly what you need it to. Sure it doesn’t have a passcode, weather readouts, and a way to send little hearts to your friends, but who needs that when you have minimalism?",2016-10-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_5876.jpg?w=738,"withings,wearable-devices,watch",The Skagen Hagen smart watch keeps tabs on your minimalist life
44,"Devin Coldewey,Jonathan Shieber","Since 1956, when computer science researchers gathered in the small town of Hanover, N.H. at Dartmouth College to talk about the field’s nascent investigations into artificial intelligence, both government and industry in the U.S. have grappled with how to structure a systematic approach to research and development in the newly important field.
From the government’s perspective, this is increasingly important. With both federal research institutions and private companies pursuing artificial intelligence breakthroughs at breakneck speed, the federal government is frankly having a bit of an existential crisis about its role in research efforts and the priorities it has for what AI research should look like.
To wit, in 2015 government spending on unclassified research and development in AI-related technologies was around $1.1 billion, according to one of the twin reports released today. But in the last five years alone, mergers and acquisitions among private companies vying for dominance in the AI market have far outstripped that figure, according to data from CB Insights.
Google’s acquistion of DeepMind was reportedly $600 million, and that’s one of over one hundred acquisitions made by companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, and Twitter since 2011.
So The White House has released a new pair of reports, offering a framework for how government-backed research into artificial intelligence should be approached and what those research initiatives should look like (basically, the government wants to avoid a Skynet scenario).
The main paper, entitled “Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence,” focuses on the general state of and challenges faced by AI, and both of those things have a constant presence on our front page.
Google, for instance, addressed the possibility of bias tainting the results of AI systems, which know not what they do. This is merely irritating when it’s an image recognition error, but what if it’s for “predictive policing”?
Google’s solution, at least for now, is what they call the “equality of opportunity” method, which ensures a system doesn’t accidentally discriminate based on sensitive, non-relevant data, for instance race or religion, when calculating something not directly related to them. As for understanding the models created by machine learning — that’s a bigger problem.
As AI and AI-like systems proliferate, they begin to overlap with highly regulated areas, as we’ve seen with autonomous vehicles and drones. This creates a sort of wild west compared with the traditional sides of those industries, and things like reporting and risk management aren’t anywhere near formalized.
How detailed should Google’s self-driving car accident reports be? Can NTSB officials inspect Autopilot code? Where do federal and state authority interface?
To make informed decisions, the White House suggests more and better data is required:
Furthermore, as AI systems infiltrate our infrastructure, the cowboys of private AI research should look to old school civil engineers for help, as little as they might like the idea:
You’ve got to get them while they’re young, according to the White House. And we agree, of course: STEM education should start early — with an emphasis on the T, in this case.
Of course, a data-literate citizenry implies a literate citizenry, and the ethics of all this stuff won’t be learned in CS class, so we can’t neglect the humanities, either.
The report also calls for pushes for diversity, highlighting comments solicited from experts regarding “the importance of AI being produced by and for diverse populations.”
The goal with both papers is to establish what an effective approach to artificial intelligence looks like from a government perspective. There’s an understanding that corporate interests will pursue corporate interests, but a range of issues exist in the development of artificial intelligence technologies that businesses are not necessarily equipped to deal with. And they don’t have any incentives to try and grapple with some of these issues anyway.
The report on the government’s strategic investment plan states:
Alongside this emphasis on artificial intelligence for the public good, is an acknowledgement that these innovations could lead to job insecurity as the robots take over. That’s why one of the main thrusts of the government’s research is in how to make artificial intelligence work with humans rather than exclusively work for humans, or work instead of humans.
The meat of the government’s strategy, outlined in the bullet points below, deals with the human cost of artificial intelligence.
It’s also worth mentioning that these reports aren’t the last word (or even the first word) on the U.S. approach to artificial intelligence. There are at least seven other (probably very long) research and development strategic plans that deal with aspects of the government’s approach to AI research.
That’s a good thing, too because, as the White House report acknowledges, we’re no longer necessarily the leader in the field. Research from China has outstripped the U.S. (at least in terms of papers published on the subject).

Now’s the time for a more invigorated policy, which perhaps these papers will help charge.",2016-10-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/datawhitehouse.jpg?w=738,"white-house,artificial-intelligence",Here’s how The White House wants the U.S. to approach AI R&D
45,Frederic Lardinois,"HoloLens, Microsoft’s $3,000 mixed-reality goggles (or “the world’s first self-contained holographic computer” in Microsoft’s parlance), was only available in the U.S. and Canada so far. Today, however, the company announced that it will also start selling the devices in Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Preorders start today and the devices will ship in late November.
We hear that Microsoft’s yield for producing HoloLenses is higher than it expected, so the company is now also able to bring it to new regions faster than it expected. What’s gating an even wider rollout, though, is that Microsoft still needs to get its certifications from the international equivalents of the U.S.’s FCC as it enters new markets. It’s worth noting that even though it’s officially only rolling out in a few European countries, the single European market pretty much means anybody in Europe will be able to get a HoloLens now.
Like in the U.S. and Canada, potential buyers will be able to choose between the standard $3,000 Development Edition or the $5,000 Commercial Suite that includes better support, as well as added security and device management features for enterprise users.
“When we set out to pioneer the mixed reality category we knew that many of the best innovations would be discovered when others got their hands on the technology,” wrote Alex Kipman, Technical Fellow, Microsoft Windows and Devices Group, in today’s announcement. “It has been quite inspiring to see what our partners have built and what individual developers have created. Together, we have only scratched the surface for what mixed reality can do. I can’t wait to see what happens next as we welcome these new countries to our holographic landscape.”
It’s worth remembering that HoloLens is only one aspect of what Microsoft calls “Windows Holographic.” The overall idea here is to also enable third-party manufacturers to use Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system to build their own mixed reality — or even virtual reality — headsets and peripherals over time.",2016-10-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_20160330_184536.jpg?w=738,"europe,hololens","Microsoft starts selling its HoloLens in Germany, France, UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand"
46,John Biggs,"The promise of 3D printing has been kind of a dud. Aside from a few cool Yoda heads and some small plastic pieces, there have been no “indie” players doing much interesting in the space except Markforged. Markforged is a Boston company we featured last year that makes carbon-fiber reinforced plastic parts using traditional 3D-printing techniques. This means the objects they print are stronger, lighter and more resilient than steel.
Now they’ve added “more precise” to that list. The Markforged Mark X is a unique 3D printer that uses laser scanning to ensure pieces that come off the machine are precisely as ordered. In other words, you can send objects that will get the “the strength and quality you’re expecting,” says founder Greg Mark, an aerospace engineer and MIT grad.
“We invented Continuous fiber reinforcement (10 issued patents), and in-process laser-micrometer quality control,” he said. “We’ve also pushed the surface finish of plastic extrusion to approach the surface finish of SLA. Now there’s one machine that combines the strength, surface finish, and quality control to enable end use parts. Supply chains will never be the same.”
Essentially the system prints very fine, very strong objects and constantly tests them for structural accuracy. When you send an object to the $68,000 printer, it ejects exactly the part you requested with exactly the right measurements.
“The in-process quality control is based off a laser micrometer integrated into the print head. With 1 micron Z axis resolution, and 50 micron X/Y resolution, you get high-resolution scans of your part, which you can pull dimensions off of in real time or use to check the accuracy of the part,” said Mark.
The system has two print heads, one for plastic and one for carbon fiber. You can set the hardness of the object while you manufacture it and, more importantly, you can control how light the object is. I’ve seen many Markforged products and they’re as solid as steel but as light as plastic. They’re surprisingly cool. Thanks to the measurement system you can basically send objects to a printer in your office or a thousand miles away and ensure that the object that comes out is exactly as you designed it and has unrivaled strength. In other words, instead of sending a milled piece of steel you can send and print a digital file.
Current Markforged owners will get a discount on the Mark X but, given this thing is almost $70,000, I doubt many hobbyists will pick one up. It’s still one of the coolest implementations of 3D printing I’ve seen, however, and it’s pretty darn close to teleportation.",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-11-at-3-43-52-pm.png?w=738,"business,technology,office-equipment",The Markforged Mark X lets you teleport precision custom parts from designer to printer
47,Ron Miller,"VMware signed deals with Microsoft, Google and IBM earlier this year as it has shifted firmly to a hybrid cloud strategy, but it was the deal it signed with AWS this week that has had everybody talking.
The cloud infrastructure market breaks down to AWS with around a third of the market — and everybody else. Microsoft is the closest competitor with around 10 percent. While VMware has had deals in place with other major players, the one with AWS matters more because it gives AWS even greater advantage in the cloud market.
The traditional vendors have taken a hybrid approach with Microsoft and IBM arguing that most large organizations, bogged down in legacy hardware and software, can’t afford to go whole hog into the cloud. It’s an argument that makes sense, especially for their customer bases.
AWS on the other hand has argued that the future is the cloud, and while it welcomed any customers, it made its bet with the companies moving to the cloud or who were born there. That approach has clearly worked with the company on an $11.5 billion run rate this year.
Meanwhile, in spite of those strategic deals with other larger IT vendors, VMware has struggled with the cloud market. It boasts almost 100 percent penetration inside the data center. It was and remains the go-to company for server virtualization, and while that worked fine in a data center-centric world, that world is changing rapidly.
What VMware did was provide a way to make use of all the resources in a machine in a much more efficient way, letting you break down that single server into multiple virtual machines. That was great for its time in the early 2000s when servers were expensive and finding ways to use them as efficiently as possible was a prime objective for IT.
The cloud changed all of that, moving the virtual machine to the cloud where you could spin up whatever resources you needed whenever you wanted and only pay for the resources you were actually using. If you needed more, you simply spun up more. If you needed less, you could take them down. That put the data center model — and VMware — at a distinct disadvantage.
You couldn’t just go out and buy more servers every time your work loads demanded it. There was a procurement process and it took weeks or months, while the cloud let you satisfy your needs almost instantly.
VMware has actually been dabbling in the cloud since around 2010 starting with an early Platform as a Service play called VMforce, which was supposed to work with Salesforce. It also began flirting with partnerships at around the same time with an early partnership with Google to take on the fledgling Microsoft Azure.
It made another hybrid cloud attempt in 2013 with the launch of vCloud Hybrid Service. It even originally launched CloudFoundry, the open source private cloud platform, which eventually became part of Pivotal, the company that EMC, VMware and GE spun out in 2012.
None of these gained much traction for VMware, however as the company was competing with all of these other vendors including AWS, Google, Microsoft and IBM — and there was little to separate itself from the pack. That brings us to the present day where the company is taking a new stab at the hybrid model and partnering like crazy with its former competitors.
Teaming with AWS is a different matter than the previous announcements because with AWS it gets the top player in the market, which could help salvage its cloud business (and indeed its entire business) after so many false starts.
As for AWS, it gets to play in the hybrid playground where it has had limited access until now. That gives the cloud infrastructure giant a way to go after Microsoft and IBM right in their prime markets and possibly gain even more marketshare.
People were talking because it was the biggest deal for VMware by far, and as for AWS, well it was a case of the rich getting richer. That has to have the competitors feeling pretty nervous today as AWS puts a stake in the ground right in their territory — and VMware gets to come along for the ride.",2016-10-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/2016-10-13_1334.png?w=738,"hybrid-cloud,infrastructure-as-a-service,aws,vmware",AWS gets richer with VMware partnership
48,Frederic Lardinois,"It’s been an open secret that Amazon’s AWS division and VMware were going to announce a partnership at a press conference in San Francisco later today. Thanks to VMware mistakenly posting its announcement early, we didn’t have to wait for the afternoon to know what the two companies will announce.
In what is surely a play to get more enterprises to move to AWS over its competitors — and to protect VMware’s leadership around virtual machines, VMware and AWS are bringing VMware’s software-defined data center software to AWS under the ‘VMware Cloud on AWS‘ moniker.

This means that all of VMware’s infrastructure software like vSphere, VSAN and NSX will soon run on AWS. The service is currently in its technology preview phase and an invite-only beta will start in early 2017 and the service will likely come out of beta in mid-2017.
The service will be operated, sold and supported by VMware (not AWS) but integrate with the rest of AWS’ cloud portfolio (think storage, database, analytics and more).
“Our customers continue to ask us to make it easier for them to run their existing data center investments alongside AWS,” wrote Andy Jassy, CEO, AWS, in today’s announcement. “Most enterprises are already virtualized using VMware, and now with VMware Cloud on AWS, for the first time, it will be easy for customers to operate a consistent and seamless hybrid IT environment using their existing VMware tools on AWS, and without having to purchase custom hardware, rewrite their applications, or modify their operating model.”
At their event today, the two companies introduced a number of early customers. These include Western Digital and Sysco.
The companies stress that this is a jointly architected service that “represents a significant investment in engineering, operations, support and sales resources from both companies.” It will run on a dedicated AWS infrastructure that was “purpose-built for this offering.” VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger also today stressed the fact that AWS and VMware worked very closely together to create this service and stressed that this will become VMware’ primary public cloud solution.

“Currently in Technology Preview, VMware Cloud on AWS, will bring VMware’s enterprise class Software-Defined Data Center software to the AWS cloud, and will enable customers to run any application across vSphere-based private, public and hybrid cloud environments,” VMware’s Mark Lohmeyer writes in today’s (currently deleted) announcement. “It will be operated, managed and sold by VMware as an on-demand, elastically scalable service and customers will be able to leverage AWS services such as developer tools, analytics, databases, and more.”

While Microsoft, IBM and others have strongly focused on the idea of the “hybrid cloud” (that is, a setup where an enterprise uses both its own data centers and public cloud services like Azure, Google Cloud or AWS), Amazon has mostly ignored this market.
Given that VMware already dominates in many of these enterprise’s own on-premises data centers but doesn’t own a public cloud service to give these users a hybrid option — and that AWS doesn’t offer an on-premises version of its services — it makes sense for these two companies to team up now.
VMware also stressed in its announcement the hybrid capabilities this partnership enables and notes that it will bring “full VM compatibility and total workload portability between the datacenter and the AWS cloud.”

It’s worth noting that AWS already offered some support for VMware’s vCenter for managing virtual machines. Thanks to this, vCenter admins have long been able to manage their AWS EC2 cloud computing instances using the same software they use for managing their VMware virtual machines. That service, too, made it relatively easy to move existing virtual machines to EC2.
As IBM kindly pointed out in a series of emails meant to preempt today’s announcement, VMware and IBM already teamed up and announced a partnership back in February. This deal with AWS seems to go quite a bit further, though.
Update: we updated this post to reflect AWS’ and VMware’s comments at their press conference today.

49,Ron Miller,"Atlassian wants the best of both the cloud and data center worlds, and it announced at the Atlassian Summit today that it was expanding its data center-cloud strategy with new products.
At a time when companies are shifting their business to the cloud, it may seem like an odd approach to offer both cloud and on-prem products, but Atlassian sees it as hedging its bets in a world that remains very much hybrid.
The company makes a variety of tools designed to help development (and other department) teams work together including HipChat, Jira, Confluence and BitBucket. Over the years they have seen the size of deployments rise dramatically with as high as 50,000 users running on Jira, according to Atlassian president Jay Simons. Some customers weren’t comfortable running these massive deployments in the cloud.
To meet that demand, the company introduced its data center product line a few years ago, and today it’s expanding that line to include HipChat Data Center in Beta. HipChat is the chat tool that competes with Slack (and now Workplace by Facebook) in the enterprise messaging space.
Simons says like the other data center products, they created HipChat Data Center for companies that prefer to run their software on their own infrastructure.
The company also announced the ability to upgrade Jira Software Data Center without taking the system down. This is particularly important to customers because they often use Jira to manage mission critical projects and downtime can mean lost business.
“Part of challenge behind on prem is that when you upgrade, you need to take it offline. We’ve added features to let you upgrade without taking the system offline,” Simons explained.
And for those who want to deploy to cloud infrastructure instead of the data center, Atlassian announced improved support for companies deploying their data center products on Amazon Web Services.
While the company acknowledges, it’s challenging to maintain a cloud and on-prem product set, it believes it’s providing customers a choice to deploy wherever and however they want.
Atlassian has the distinction of being profitable for 10 straight years. They tend to sell over the web (although that would seem to be more difficult with on-prem products than those in the cloud). It went public last December after raising $210 million. Today it has a market cap of over $6 billion.

50,Frederic Lardinois,"Serverless offers developers an open source framework that allows them to more easily write applications for platform like AWS Lambda and — in the near future — Microsoft’s Azure Functions and Google’s Cloud Functions. The company today announced that its framework is now out of beta and that it has raised a $3 million seed round led by Trinity Ventures.
The serverless movement that gives Serverless its name is, of course, a bit of a misnomer. The overall idea here is to abstract all of the actual infrastructure away so developers can deploy their code for what are usually event-driven compute services like Lambda. Those services then execute that code when it’s triggered — and all of that code then runs on AWS’ servers, of course.
Still, the name works and Serverless founder and CEO Austen Collins was one of the first to see the potential for building a framework that would allow enterprises and startups to more easily develop for this new compute model. “I thought it was fun and something that — while not technically accurate because it takes lots of servers to power a serverless platform — is a very efficient term in describing the holy grail for developers,” Collins said.
Before founding Serverless, Collins was an AWS consultant and saw how companies are now being pushed to deliver and deploy new applications faster than ever before. “And this is why Lambda spoke to me in particular,” Collins told me. He especially liked Lambda because it allowed developers to easily tie in the rest of AWS’s features. With an increased interest in microservices — that is, splitting complex applications into small parts that are connected by APIs — even relatively conservative enterprise companies are now looking at Lambda and similar platforms to help them speed up their development cycles.
Serverless is part of Heavybit’s program that helps startups take their developers products to market (others that have gone through the process before include the likes of Stripe, PagerDuty and CircleCI). The company now has twelve employees and Collins plans to use the funding to put more resources behind the development of the framework and to add support other cloud computing services beyond AWS.
One thing Serverless hasn’t quite decided on yet, though, is how it will monetize its service. Collins admitted that this is something the team is still working on, but as an open source company, there are some obvious avenues the Serverless can try (offering paid consulting services and paid proprietary features among those). Both Heavybit and Trinity Ventures (which previously invested in Docker and similar developer-centric companies) also have a lot of experience in how to monetize this kind of company. On GitHub, the project has received more than 11,000 stars and Serverless already counts the Coca-Cola Company among its users, so there is clearly demand and interest in its framework, even if the serverless movement itself is still very young.",2016-10-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/fb_data_center_tour-6.jpg?w=738,"enterprise,developers,aws-lambda",Serverless raises $3M to help developers go serverless
51,Lora Kolodny,"Noodle Partners Inc., a new education venture from the founder of The Princeton Review and 2U Inc., John Katzman, has raised $4 million in venture funding to help colleges and universities deliver high-quality certificate and degree programs online.
Philadelphia-based Osage Venture Partners led the investment in Noodle Partners and was joined by New Markets Venture Partners, 500 Startups and others.
Katzman tells TechCrunch that the challenge in delivering online education at the college and university level has changed dramatically over the last decade, and not just because of the rise of smartphones.
“People did not believe that higher ed could be as good online as a campus-based program. That’s because the first wave was full of for-profits that were just not very good schools. Today, there are many great schools online and we know the problem is not the medium. The new challenge is building and offering programs that are great, but also lower the cost of higher education,” Katzman said in 2008, when he co-founded 2U Inc. with Chip Paucek and Jeremy Johnson.
Trump University, and the University of Phoenix (owned by Apollo Education) are two famous examples of unscrupulous, for-profit online schools in that earlier wave. These organizations sold students on useless degrees and costly seminars that would leave them more in debt than anything else.
College enrollment in the U.S. has declined for five straight years, according to the most recent available data from the National Center for Education Statistics. That correlates with a 34% increase in the cost for undergraduate tuition, fees, room, and board at public colleges and universities, and a 25% increase at private non-profit institutions between 2004 and 2014.
Katzman believes that offering more of their degree programs online, and at a higher quality than ever before, will help colleges reverse that trend.
New York-based Noodle Partners offers colleges and universities help setting up an online degree program, instructional design for courses within the program, recruiting, tech support, and measuring student engagement along the way to course completion. The startup charges for setup and a flat fee per student.
Other companies doing this work (called “online program management”) will typically take a large percent of tuition they help schools generate from their online offerings, cutting into the school’s already challenged margins.
Competitors to Noodle Partners include 2U, the company Katzman started but with which he is no longer affiliated, Academic Partnerships, HotChalk, Keypath, Pearson Embanet, Wiley Education Solution and others.
Osage Venture Partners’ Nate Lentz said he backed Noodle Partners believing, “Something needs to change the cost curve in higher ed.”

52,Lora Kolodny,"DroneDeploy wants businesses to be able to find a drone services provider as easily as anyone can find a place to eat dinner, anywhere in the world. So today, the company unveiled a new free Drone Mapping Directory.
Take, for example, a real estate developer who needs a finely detailed map of land where it may soon build a giant, corporate campus.
Instead of buying drones equipped to scan that property, then training or hiring pilots to fly them, the developer could just flip through the profiles on the Drone Mapping Directory, look at examples of maps they’d created in the past, then connect with the most desirable vendors in their area.
DroneDeploy developed this directory at the behest of its users, said CEO Mike Winn. Of course, helping professional drone operators tap into unmet demand in the market will also lead to increased use of DroneDeploy’s technology.
For the unfamiliar, DroneDeploy makes cloud-based software for drone operators which allows them to plan flights, then rapidly gather, store, analyze and create visualizations using data gathered from those flights.
DroneDeploy users have mapped and analyzed over 6 million acres in over 130 countries to-date, the company says.
Its systems are available on a freemium basis. Paying users get more storage capacity and professional features. They can, for example, create co-branded DroneDeploy maps to include in portfolios or deliver as final projects to their own clients.
Winn said that since the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration released its Part 107 rule, making it easier for individuals to become certified, commercial drone operators, small businesses providing drone services have been proliferating in the U.S.
More than 12,000 individuals have been certified as remote pilots under the rule since it went into effect in late summer, the CEO said.
Rather than building and flying their own proprietary drones, drone services providers use state of the art, available technologies to do things like shoot aerial videos for media and entertainment, conduct aerial surveys of farms, construction sites, or critical infrastructure, gather property damage information for insurance providers, or fly drones to gather data for scientific research.
Other directories and marketplaces exist for booking drone service providers, of course, including JobforDrones.com, or for aerial photography, Dronebase, and Airstoc.

53,Lora Kolodny,"According to a new study published today from the American Civil Liberties Union, major social networks including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have recently provided user data access to Geofeedia, the location-based, social media surveillance system used by government offices, private security firms, marketers and others.
As TechCrunch previously reported, Geofeedia is one of a bevy of technologies used, secretly, by police to monitor activists and the contents of their discussions online.
The ACLU said in a blog post that both Twitter and Facebook (which owns Instagram) made some immediate changes in response to their study’s findings.
“Instagram cut off Geofeedia’s access to public user posts, and Facebook cut its access to a topic-based feed of public user posts,” the ACLU said.
The ACLU also noted in their post:
“Neither Facebook nor Instagram has a public policy specifically prohibiting developers from exploiting user data for surveillance purposes. Twitter does have a ‘longstanding rule’ prohibiting the sale of user data for surveillance as well as a Developer Policy that bans the use of Twitter data ‘to investigate, track or surveil Twitter users.’”
On Tuesday, following the publication of the ACLU findings, Twitter announced that it would “immediately suspend Geofeedia’s commercial access to Twitter data.”
A Facebook spokesperson tells TechCrunch:
“[Geofeedia] only had access to data that people chose to make public. Its access was subject to the limitations in our Platform Policy, which outlines what we expect from developers that receive data using the Facebook Platform. If a developer uses our APIs in a way that has not been authorized, we will take swift action to stop them and we will end our relationship altogether if necessary.”
It’s worth noting that Facebook’s platform policy generically limits developers.
For example, it says developers are not permitted to “sell, license, or purchase any data obtained” from Facebook or its services. And they can’t transfer data they get from Facebook, including “anonymous, aggregate, or derived data,” to any data brokers. Finally, developers are not permitted to put Facebook data into any search engines or directories without the social network’s explicit permission.
We have reached out to Geofeedia for comment but executives were not immediately available for an interview.
A public relations consultant for Geofeedia sent a lengthy statement, attributed to Geofeedia CEO Phil Harris, defending the company’s practices in general. An excerpt follows:

54,Ron Miller,"We’ve been hearing all artificial intelligence, all the time from the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) industry over the last several weeks. Microsoft is the latest to trumpet its AI capabilities for sales people with the general availability of Dynamics 365 coming on November 1st.
Microsoft announced last summer that it was going to be combining its ERP and CRM into a unified solution, and this is the culmination of that announcement. Like many large organizations, Microsoft tends to deliver the news in waves — it’s coming, it’s in beta, it’s here.
While the news smacks of “look at me too,” Microsoft points out it has been working on AI long before its biggest competitors like Salesforce and Oracle, which recently announced their own AI capabilities at their respective customer conferences, Dreamforce and Oracle Open World.
Microsoft has built in a couple of intelligence features into the release designed specifically for sales and service personnel. First, there is Customer Insights, a stand-alone cloud service, which enables users to bring in a variety of internal and external data sources. Companies can integrate all of this data with internal metrics (KPIs) to drive automated actions based on the data. The solution includes partner data from the likes of Facebook and Trip Advisor (proving you don’t need to own an external data source to take advantage of it).
It’s been designed as a stand-alone service that can work with any of the Dynamics 365 CRM components — sales, customer service or field service — and can also work with any external CRM tool with open APIs. This last point is particularly telling because it’s giving customers who might not be using Dynamics 365 (but are using other Microsoft tools like Outlook) access to this feature.
The second piece is called Relationship Insights, which as the name suggests gives sales people information about the status of their customer relationships at any given moment. It’s built on the on the Cortana Intelligence Suite, which Microsoft introduced in 2015 and uses tools like sentiment analysis to check on the likelihood of the deal closing and the next best action to take.
If this sounds familiar, it should because it’s very similar to what we’ve been hearing over the last month from a variety of CRM vendors. While you might legitimately wonder why sales and service people are the recipients of all the wonder that is AI in the enterprise, it seems like a reasonable starting point to improve the likelihood of making sales and understanding your customers better, an increasingly important capability in the mobile-social-cloud age.
It’s important to remember that we are really just at the rudimentary beginnings of where this type of technology could eventually take us. Over time we will see this intelligence added to bots (and other delivery methods) to hide the complexity of the underlying software and guide users to an answer or solution. The idea is to increase our productivity over time, although we are a long way from achieving that goal just yet.
For now, know that Microsoft has consolidated its artificial intelligence tools into a single, coherent division and just about every vendor — not just those selling CRM — is trying to build some level of intelligence into its products. Dynamics 365 is just the latest manifestation.",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-452481532.jpg?w=738,"erp,crm",Microsoft announces GA of Dynamics 365 with AI features
55,Ron Miller,"Last year Apttus, which provides pricing, quoting and contract building on the Salesforce platform was growing at a crazy rate. It appeared to be headed to IPO or a Salesforce purchase when it got a punch to the gut. Salesforce bought Steelbrick instead.
Sources say, Apttus might have gotten greedy, thinking it was the only enterprise CPQ product out there that provided the best fit for Salesforce’s target enterprise customer base. These sources say, it believed it could ask Salesforce for a premium price. Salesforce apparently balked and bought Steelbrick instead for $360 million.
While Salesforce didn’t get the heavy-duty enterprise customer base with Steelbrick, it got a better price, a similar product built on its platform and easy integration with the Salesforce product family. It was willing to make that trade-off and Apttus was left to reevaluate its future without Salesforce as potential buyer. While there was talk of a 2016 IPO, the market took the wind out of that discussion for this year.
After Salesforce’s bought Steelbrick, the first thing Apttus did was to begin to build some separation, porting the product from the only platform it had ever known to Microsoft Dynamics. While Microsoft’s product has substantially less marketshare, it offers the kind of enterprise customers that fit well with Apttus’ customer base.
They also starting looking to the future and thinking about new ways to deliver the product. Last week I visited the company booth at Dreamforce, Salesforce’s customer conference, where Apttus still has a substantial presence, and I saw a company experimenting with advanced technologies like virtual reality and bots.
I got a chance to try the application using Microsoft Hololens, the company’s virtual reality platform. While it’s rough, it provides a pathway to deliver Apttus software via a virtual reality interface. In the demo, I’m inside an airplane and I can try different designs like single seat or double seats. I can click the choice I want with a clicker in my hand, and as I make my choices, I can look to the side and see a pricing sheet with my choices and the total cost.
They have also developed a bot, which feels much further along than the VR application. Using the bot, you can undertake activities such as starting a contract, and copying content from another contract as the basis. You can tell the bot what to edit, all with simple human commands and you generate a PDF at the end, which you can review and share.
 
It takes what once was a complex set of tasks involving a lot of copying and pasting and has distilled it down to a conversation with the software. The bot, which is built using Microsoft Azure tools works in Slack and Skype for now, but could work with other messaging software in the future.
Apttus took a new $88 million round of funding at the end of last month on a reported valuation of $1.3 billion. The company hasn’t made a secret of the fact it wants to go public, and expects to do that next year.
For now, with Salesforce no longer a likely suitor, the company is moving on and taking steps to ensure it can survive with Salesforce or without it — and bots and VR could be a big part of that.",2016-10-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/ron-apttus-hololens.jpg?w=477,"dreamforce,cpq,apttus",Apttus looks to the future with bots and virtual reality
56,Ingrid Lunden,"After 20 months in a closed beta under the working title Facebook at Work, (as we predicted it would the other week) today Facebook is finally bringing its enterprise-focused messaging and social networking service to market under a new name, Workplace.
It’s not only armed with a new brand: Workplace is launching with a new kind of pricing model based on Facebook-style monthly active user metrics; and some pretty big ambitions after picking up 1,000 organizations as customers while still in its free, pilot mode (up from 100 a year ago).
Workplace — which is launching as a desktop and mobile app with News Feed, Groups both for your own company and with others, Chat direct messaging, Live video, Reactions, translation features, and video and audio calling — is now opening up to anyone to use, and the operative word here is “anyone”.
To really gain critical mass for the product and help it stand out from others in the market, Facebook is courting not just companies’ white-collar, desk-dwelling “knowledge workers” who typically buy and use enterprise messaging software.
It also wants to bring on the much wider global wedge of employees who serve customers, maintain machines or otherwise roam as part of their jobs — people who may already be using Facebook in their non-working life, but who have rarely been co-opted into an organization’s wider digital collaboration efforts in the past.
Workplace is opening for business long after a number of competing services have made their mark and picked up significant traction — popular rival software in the area of enterprise communication and messaging includes the likes of Slack, Yammer (now part of Microsoft), Chatter from Salesforce, Hipchat and Jive, among many others.
There are even a range of lesser-known business messaging apps built specifically for “non-desk” workers, including Zinc (originally called Cotap), Beekeeper and more.
Why the delay? “We had to build this totally separate from Facebook, and we had to test and get all the possible certifications to be a SaaS vendor,” Julien Codorniou, director of Workplace, explained in an interview in London, where the development of the product was based. Those developments are still happening. He told me that as of last week Workplace joined the US/EU Privacy Shield. 
The other reason has to do with the kinds of companies and non-traditional SaaS buyers it was targeting. “We wanted to see how it would work in very conservative industries and government agencies,” he said. “We had to test the product in every possible geography and industry, especially the most conservative ones. We feel we are ready for primetime now.”

Workplace may not be first to the market, but it’s hoping to woo people with a few twists.
One of these comes in the form of pricing. Enterprise software companies typically follow a few standard business models: they include charging per-seat, based on a certain number of users at your company; in larger tiers based on the same principle of user numbers; based on feature sets; and under a freemium model, where you get a small number of basics for a small group, with the understanding that you soon be ramping up to more features in the paid tiers.
Facebook has thrown most of this out of the window and is opting instead to take a page from its own book of metrics.
It’s going to offer everyone the same features, and charge for Workplace by monthly active users — defined in this case as opening up and using Workplace at least once in the month. Facebook will charge $3 per user per month for the first 1,000 users; $2 for the next 1,001-10,000; and $1 for any MAUs above that.
(As a pricing point of comparison, Slack charges $8 and $15 per active user per month for two tiers of features, with the price going down if you pay annually. It has yet to launch its enterprise tier for extra-large organizations.)
The reason for the pricing by MAUs, and at these competitive prices, was made for a couple of reasons. For starters, it means that what is being bought becomes more transparent to the customer.
But also: Facebook then holds itself more accountable for the service. You pay only for what you are actually using, and Facebook essentially only gets paid for how engaging it’s managed to make the service, much like ads that run on the platform.
“We wanted to build enterprise software the Facebook way,” said Codorniou.
Another interesting aspect of the pricing concerns the tiers of numbers Facebook is throwing around. The company would not give us a total number of MAUs for Workplace as of today. But it is clear that the aim is to target very large companies and other organizations with this product.
Some of the early customers that Facebook has signed up have included 36,000 employees at the carrier Telenor, and 100,000 employees at the Royal Bank of Scotland, and today Facebook’s announcing more such as Danone (100,000 employees), Starbucks (238,000 employees) and Booking.com (13,000).
It also has organizations like the Royal National Institute for the Blind, Oxfam, and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore.
While Facebook is charging for Workplace, making tons of money from it doesn’t appear to be its actual goal — not at first, at least. The goal, Codorniou said, is to gain some critical mass for the product.
“We’re going to grow Workplace like Instagram and Messenger,” he said. “Before you even think about monetization, we want to spend the first years growing it. We are obsessed with growth.”
Another way that Facebook might just succeed with at least getting people to try out Workplace, if not switch over to using it permanently, is based on the fact that works just like Facebook itself.
With the main consumer service now pushing past 1.7 billion monthly active users, it’s likely that a good portion of a company’s employees will either already know the service, if not already use it.
This will mean people will be instantly familiar with how the product looks and works, which in the closed beta has translated into a very high amount of engagement with the product. Among the 1,000 companies and other organizations that have been using Workplace in its closed beta, there have been no fewer than 100,000 user groups already created.
As we have written about Facebook at Work in the past, much of Workplace will essentially look just like the Facebook you already know and probably use today.
There is a News Feed. There are Groups that you can build within your own company and with colleagues at other organizations that you work with regularly. There is a Messenger equivalent that Facebook refers to as “Chat”.
There is Live video as well as group video and audio calling. You can comment on posts with multi-emotional Reactions and there are automatic translation features.
There are also some partnerships from day one that speak to the aim of working with big enterprises that may already be using other services. They include the likes of Okta, OneLogin and Ping for log-ins and identity services, Box for storage, and integrators like Deloitte and Sada Systems.
But generally speaking, there isn’t a long list of integrations that will work with Workplace from the start, a la Slack, which lets you bring in work and data from hundreds of other apps with short-cut slash-commands.
Codorniou said that this was intentional.
“We wanted to talk about an easy to use product and democratic pricing with customers,” he said. “When I talked to the CEO of Danone, whose 100,000 employees include many people without computers and desks, usage and engagement were more important than whether Workplace integrated with Workday or Quip.” 
(Interesting sidenote to this: for now, Cordorniou told me that Facebook requires all potential sales partners and integrators to actually sign up for Workplace and use it before they are allowed to work on it. “I don’t see how you can sell it without using it first,” he said.)
From what I understand, it’s likely that Slack-style integrations, along with other bells and whistles like bots and the multitude of other features that have invaded Messenger, are likely to come down the line very soon, with the first of them making an appearance at Facebook’s F8 conference this coming spring.
For now, the message to the market may be big enough: Facebook has become a de facto platform for billions of consumers globally to communicate with each other in the digital world, and now it is aggressively moving to be the same in the working world.",2016-10-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/04_workplace_homepage_desktop.png?w=738,,Workplace by Facebook opens to sell enterprise social networking to the masses
57,Ron Miller,"Salesforce has been on a shopping spree this year, spending in the neighborhood of $5-6 billion on 10 companies. That’s why it was interesting to hear company president, vice chairman and COO, Keith Block talk about what they look for in an acquisition target at a press conference at Dreamforce this week. This is particularly true in the context of rumors that Salesforce was interested in buying Twitter.
First of all, it’s worth noting that most Salesforce purchases this year and over the years have typically been under $1 billion. The notable exception was the $2.8 billion the company spent for Demandware in June and the $2.5 billion it spent to buy ExactTarget in 2013. A more comfortable level appears to be in the $100 – $300 million range (although the company spent $750 million to buy Quip last summer and a similar total amount to get the ad tech company Krux this week).
But there is more to a buying decision than purely just money — and this is worth keeping in mind in the context of a possible Twitter deal. Block reiterated something that he said last year at the Dreamforce press conference — that Salesforce always looks at M&A activity in the context of the customer, and how the purchase will drive their relationship with their customers.
That said, he noted they do not do M&A willy-nilly. They have a methodology and a list of companies they could be interested in at any given time, one which they are constantly updating. To get on the list, they look at a number of different criteria and balance what the target company could bring to Salesforce (and its customers), and the possible risk of buying the company.
“We look at culture. Will it be a good cultural fit? Is it good product fit? Is there talent? Is there financial value? What are the risks of assimilating the company into our company,” Block explained.
He said once you acquire the company, you then have to balance integration versus innovation. You’re buying the company for the technology, and you don’t want to quash all of the reasons you are spending the money to bring it into the fold. At the same time, there has to be some level of integration within the organization at large.
“If you drive growth and experimentation, you might not get leverage into the installed base. If you push too hard on integration you get cost savings, but you might hurt innovation,” Block explained.
If you look at Quip as an example, Salesforce obviously sees Quip as a strategic asset or it wouldn’t have bought it, but the company continues to operate independently with customers outside of Salesforce. At the same time, it has begun to build integration points from Quip into the Salesforce platform. So you can see the balance between integration and innovation right there.
As for Twitter, looking at the buying process Block outlined, it makes it appear even less likely that Salesforce would leave its purchase-price comfort zone. Sure, all that real-time data is a tantalizing target, especially for a company pushing artificial intelligence, but the price has to be right, the fit has to be right, and it’s not clear it would be, or if it would be worth the significant financial risk.
This has to be part of standard on-going internal discussion at Salesforce as it looks at any acquisition target, and it would seem business discipline would require they stay true to that approach, regardless of the company they are looking at.",2016-10-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/keith-block.jpg?w=738,"mergers-and-acquisitons,crm,keith-block",The method in Salesforce’s M&A madness
58,Todd Gardner,"

An entrepreneur recently asked me “What are SaaS companies ‘going for’ these days?” I said, “Well, it depends on a number of factors, but 5 times annual run-rate revenue is average.” His response was pure disbelief. “What? You have to be kidding me! Last time I checked they were going for 10 times revenue!”
And so it goes; the opaque, confusing and highly volatile practice of valuing a private SaaS business is frustrating for entrepreneurs and investors alike. Furthermore, the lack of transparency adds a tremendous amount of friction to a capital raise or the sale of a company.
The reality is, it’s not all that hard to get a quick read on your SaaS company’s valuation. The two most important things to know are: What are public SaaS companies “going for” at the time, and how fast is your business growing relative to its peers. These two things will get you 75 percent of the way to an answer, and three or four other metrics will get you the rest of the way there.
The average public multiple is easy to get and it should always be updated when getting a read on valuation. Go here to pull the data and get the revenue multiple based on the current year expected revenue. Once you have that, subtract 1.3 to get the current private multiple based on ARR* (annualized run-rate revenue). Private multiples are lower because they are generally riskier and the stock is not easy to sell. If the public multiple were 7.0 times revenue, for example, then the average private multiple would be 5.7 times.
Building from there, the key company-specific metric is revenue growth rate. But it gets a little tricky here because to get a higher multiple, your company must be growing faster than other similar-sized SaaS companies. It’s easier to grow quickly when a company is small, and so the growth premium varies by company size.
The chart below shows the average growth rate for different-sized private SaaS companies based on a 2016 survey of 400 companies, and this should be used as your benchmark. If your company is growing faster than average for its size, the business will be worth more than the 5.7 times calculated above; if it’s growing slower, it will be worth less.

How much of an impact the growth rate has on valuation can be estimated based on public SaaS company values. A rule of thumb would be if your business is growing at twice the average rate, the valuation multiple would grow by 50 percent. For example, a $3.0 million SaaS company growing at 100 percent (twice the rate of its peers) would get a growth premium of 2.8 (50 percent of the baseline multiple of 5.7), making it worth about 8.5 times revenue, or $26 million. Similarly, a $60 million SaaS business growing at 50 percent is also growing twice as fast as its peers, and would also garner a similar growth premium.
There are four other metrics that will impact a company’s value beyond the current state of the public market and its growth rate. They are:
Do better than “average” on these factors and the valuation multiple will go up; do worse, and it will go down. The chart below can be used to estimate the overall impact of each factor.

The fact of the matter is, SaaS companies, on average, were never “going for 10 times revenue,” only a few outliers were. The reality is a little less sexy, but still very healthy, and knowing where your business stands based on real-world data will give you an advantage in negotiating the best possible outcome for your company.

59,Matthew Lynley,"We’re hearing from several sources that a secondary financing round is in the works for GitHub, following its last $250 million financing round that valued it at $2 billion in July last year. However, there’s a little bit of interesting chatter beyond that they’re raising a secondary for potential liquidation of investors or employees, we hear.
There are two parts to the story: first, this secondary round may value the company below the $2 billion valuation from its previous round. One source estimated the range could even be around $1.5 billion, though we couldn’t pin down the exact number. However, another source tells us that this secondary is likely for common stock, which could complicate the matter a bit. It’s hard to tell exactly where preferences lie and what rights investors got, so the valuation calculation can get a little fuzzy here — and it may not, in the end, technically be a down round in the traditional sense.
But perhaps the more interesting one is that a rumor is flying around that Microsoft is sniffing around the company. We aren’t sure if it’s related to an acquisition or potentially a strategic investment (talks around one may inevitably lead to the other), or it could be that the companies may be exploring a deeper partnership. A representative from GitHub said there’s no truth to the Microsoft acquisition rumors, though declined to comment on the rest of the story. A representative from Microsoft declined to comment.
We weren’t able to learn who would be able to participate in this secondary round — whether it would be investors or employees. But either way, given that GitHub is an eight-year-old company, the liquidation event shouldn’t be super surprising.

GitHub is probably one of the most widely-adopted developer tools in the world — serving as a go-to resource for not only managing code repositories, but also a vital part of the whole open source ecosystem. Keeping those open-source projects healthy and active is a pivotal tool for larger companies, which can use contributors as a farm system for their developer teams and also pick off interesting ideas that pop up from those communities. But like any light-touch resource for traditional developers, the company needs to expand into enterprises if it’s going to grow into a fully sustainable business. That’s going to be incredibly challenging.
Speaking of Microsoft — they also have GitHub-like tools within Visual Studio Team Services, so perhaps that’s where the chatter about the company checking in with GitHub is coming from.
GitHub also faces increasing competition, including from the likes of recently-IPO’d Atlassian. Last year, following its IPO, the company immediately jumped 32% on its first day of trading and valued it at $5.8 billion. That was largely on the strength of the company actually being profitable when it went public. There’s also the recently-emerging GitLab, which is based on open-source Git tools, that raised $20 million just last month.",2016-10-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-459236718.jpg?w=738,,GitHub is raising a secondary round
60,Ron Miller,"When Salesforce purchased Quip last summer for $750 million, it seemed at face value to be an unusual acquisition for the cloud CRM company — Salesforce tends to concentrate on more vertical targets.
In fact, at a press conference this week at Dreamforce, Salesforce president, vice chairman and COO Keith Block — yes, he has all those titles — said when asked about the company’s acquisition strategy, “We go very hard into vertical markets.” He then used the company’s $2.8 billion Demandware purchase as a prime example of this approach.
Quip is the opposite. It’s a productivity app, designed to be mobile first, and which builds in collaboration and communication right at the document level. Quip founder and CEO Bret Taylor said they really wanted to put the communication component front and center when they were designing the app.

Block has said in the past that when it comes to acquisitions, his company is always looking for better ways to serve the customer — theirs and those of their users. He admits Quip may not seem obvious as a product that serves the customer, but it’s about productivity, and that’s something that could touch every part of the Salesforce platform.
“Quip is very compelling. Some people think it’s an unorthodox acquisition, but it’s in the context of driving productivity for customers,” he said.
Taylor unsurprisingly agrees. “One way to think about it is that a lot of their products are vertical. Productivity is horizontal. Ours is a separate product and can integrate into all the Salesforce products,” he said.
There was also a good cultural match, and Salesforce liked the Quip team, a point that Block says the company looks at very closely when making acquisition decisions.
When Quip was sold, it came as a bit of a surprise, but Taylor said he and his team saw an opportunity to reach a scale that would have taken years on their own. He points to the scope of the Dreamforce conference as a prime example of the reach of Salesforce. The company boasted that 175,000 people registered for the event. It’s doubtful that many showed up, but even so, it’s an enormous event and Quip had a big presence there, which wouldn’t have been possible before the acquisition.
The idea of a deeper relationship began shortly after Quip agreed to build a Salesforce Lightning module earlier this year. It didn’t take long for the discussions to advance beyond that, and they began to talk about something deeper. It didn’t hurt that Taylor and Salesforce CEO and chairman Marc Benioff have known each other for a long time, and that really helped advance the discussion.
At Dreamforce, Quip announced some direct integrations with Salesforce, including (as you would expect) single sign-on and the previously mentioned Lightning module to enable users to link, access and create Quip documents, spreadsheets and task lists inside of Salesforce. Finally, it includes what they are calling “rich mentions.” These are live Salesforce fields that live inside Quip documents, so if you drag closed deal data into your document, it will update automatically each time the deal data info changes in Salesforce.
For those who aren’t interested in Salesforce, Quip is still available as a standalone product, and in fact continues to operate as a separate company within the larger entity. But it’s clear that the integrations announced this week at Dreamforce are only the beginning of what we will see in the future, and Quip is very much an important part of the Salesforce product family — even if it might seem like an atypical one.",2016-10-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-492979536.jpg?w=738,"collaboration,bret-taylor,quip",Salesforce took a horizontal turn when it bought Quip
61,Ron Miller,"Salesforce chairman and CEO Marc Benioff knows a thing or two about how to put on a good show. As usual, he pulled out all the stops this week at Dreamforce, his company’s massive customer conference in San Francisco.
He was boasting at the keynote that 175,000 people registered online (and another 15 million were watching online). I can tell you most people I spoke to didn’t think anywhere close to that number of people showed up, but it was also hard to tell. The conference was spread out across the city, including all three Moscone buildings and some of the hotels nearby. Many restaurants around Moscone were closed for private events from sponsors. The company even took over the street between Moscone North and South, laid down some fake grass and put in “Dream Park.”
This year there was a national park theme and there were signs everywhere that echoed the design of the iconic national park signs. The idea was that every participant was an explorer blazing trails. It was part of the gamification of the event to get people to visit as much stuff as possible.
The event, built in its chairman’s image, included charity booths, a mindfulness booth staffed by French monks and a meditation room. One of the special guests at the keynote was Will.I.Am. The conference party featured a performance by U2. Salesforce doesn’t do anything small.
But in the end, when you take out the fake grass lawn, the cartoon Einstein that joined Benioff and co-founder Parker Harris on stage for the keynote — Einstein is part of Salesforce’s latest initiative involving artificial intelligence — and all of the smoke and mirrors, it was ultimately about entertaining and informing customers, and selling Salesforce as a visionary company.
At a press conference on Thursday, company vice chairman, president and COO Keith Block talked about Salesforce’s ability to deliver new technology to the masses as a key strength of the company. “The message is embrace this technology. We believe we are uniquely qualified to deliver this technology,” he said.
Perhaps the delivery part is a bit overstated, but certainly Salesforce seems to have a unique ability to introduce new tech, whether it’s the social enterprise, big data, the Internet of Things or artificial intelligence. Surely those of us who write about this stuff for a living have heard it all, but the folks who attend this conference probably only have a slight idea of what these concepts are about. Benioff and Salesforce talk about these ideas in ways that regular business users can understand.
Artificial intelligence took center stage at this year’s Dreamforce, and it’s a challenge to explain these concepts to the masses. The fact is that Einstein, which was announced a couple of weeks before Dreamforce, isn’t actually a product. It’s a set of technologies that underly the Salesforce platform and add a level of intelligence to each of the products (or will over time).
Perhaps because artificial intelligence is hard to explain, Salesforce decided to productize it in the form of Einstein. By giving it the name of a really smart person, maybe it drove home exactly how revolutionary this technology could be. Of course, in its current early guise, it’s not that earth-shattering, offering predictive lead scoring and opportunity insights, which alert a rep how a deal is trending. These are frankly a rudimentary beginning, but this is the typical approach for Salesforce.
They get everyone revved up and thinking about these advanced concepts and they layer them onto the platform over time. The company philosophy involves staying on top of trends and introducing them early.
Dreamforce included something for everyone, with 2,700 sessions running non-stop from 8:00 in the morning until late in the afternoon. Parties abounded at night and bars overflowed with raucous attendees. There were partner pavilions and hands-on demos. There was live music on a large stage in Dream Park. There were bean bag chairs, benches and hammocks scattered across the fake green lawn. It was, for all intents and purposes, a three-ring circus.
To be fair, it wasn’t all business. Benioff continually touted charity and giving back to the community, and he seemed sincere about it. “You are at work, and you have great leadership skills. You can isolate yourselves and say I’m going to put those skills to use in a box at work, or you can say I’m going to have an integrated life. The way I look at the world, I’m going to put those skills to work to make the world a better place,” Benioff said at one point during the event.
From a news perspective, not that much came out of the conference. The Salesforce-Twitter rumors persisted, although they diminished somewhat throughout the week. Salesforce did buy an adtech company, but most of the product news was announced well before the conference. The thing is that the conference wasn’t put on for the likes of me. It was more about putting on a show for customers, while showing off the pure economic strength and vitality of Salesforce.
And it was about dreaming of big things — and pageantry, showmanship and bread and circuses.",2016-10-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-612902270.jpg?w=738,"marc-benioff,dreamforce-2016,dreamforce","Lights, cameras, Dreamforce"
62,Matthew Lynley,"Emburse launched in the Startup Battlefield last year seeking out businesses that wanted to handle one-time or a few expenses through issuing prepaid corporate debit cards. But it may be that the market, which is filled with a disparate different kinds of tools, needs a more generalized approach.
So to move beyond that, Emburse said it is opening up its service to integrate with other operations, such as building bots on Slack. With that, companies can spin up and issue prepaid cards through a number of other integrations without always having to come back to Emburse. In that way, Emburse can become a much more prolific service within traditional corporate environments and not just typical Silicon Valley early adopter companies.
“A lot of the valley are using common tools, whether it’s Slack or they’re using Greenhouse or Expensify,” co-founder Peter Lai said. “What we’re trying to do is make an addition. Once you build one integration you don’t have to do it multiple times, because we share a lot of mutual clients.”
Emburse works with banks and card-issuers to create custom pre-paid debit cards that can either be used one time or are refillable. But they are designed to be managed more rigorously through Emburse, so a finance team can keep close track of behavior.
One example use case of the new service, Lai said, would be to allow Greenhouse on behalf of recruiters to issue cards for travel and food while they are interviewing for a job. Another would be operating with a virtual assistant that might be booking flights, which users may not initially trust, Lai said.

Emburse went through Y Combinator’s winter class last year and has raised $1.5 million in seed financing, and launched at TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco last year.",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/emburse-3738.jpg?w=738,"battlefield,emburse",Emburse looks to give third-party developers ways to easily issue prepaid debit cards
63,Frederic Lardinois,"OpenStack, the massive open source project that helps enterprises run the equivalent of AWS in their own data centers, is launching the 14th major version of its software today. Newton, as this new version is called, shows how OpenStack has matured over the last few years. The focus this time is on making some of the core OpenStack services more scalable and resilient. In addition, though, the update also includes a couple of major new features. The project now better supports containers and bare metal servers, for example.
In total, more than 2,500 developers and users contributed to Newton. That gives you a pretty good sense of the scale of this project, which includes support for core data center services like compute, storage and networking, but also a wide range of smaller projects.

As OpenStack Foundation COO Mark Collier told me, the focus with Newton wasn’t so much on new features but on adding tools for supporting new kinds of workloads.
Both Collier and OpenStack Foundation executive director Jonathan Bryce stressed that OpenStack is mostly about providing the infrastructure that people need to run their workloads. The project itself is somewhat agnostic as to what workloads they want to run and which tools they want to use, though. “People aren’t looking at the cloud as synonymous with [virtual machines] anymore,” Collier said. Instead, they are mixing in bare metal and containers as well. OpenStack wants to give these users a single control plane to manage all of this.
Enterprises do tend to move slowly, though, and even the early adopters that use OpenStack are only now starting to adopt containers. “We see people who are early adopters who are running container in production,” Bryce told me. “But I think OpenStack or not OpenStack, it’s still early for containers in production usage.” He did note, however, that he is regularly talks to enterprise users who are looking at how they can use the different components in OpenStack to get to containers faster.

Core features of OpenStack, including the Nova compute service, as well as the Horizon dashboard and Swift object/blob store, have now become more scalable. The Magnum project for managing containers on OpenStack, which already supported Docker Swarm, Kubernetes and Mesos, now also allows operators to run Kubernetes clusters on bare metal servers, while the Ironic framework for provisioning those bare metal servers is now more tightly integrated with Magnuma and also now supports multi-tenant networking.
The release also includes plenty of other updates and tweaks, of course. You can find a full (and fully overwhelming) rundown of what’s new in all of the different projects here.
With this release out of the door, the OpenStack community is now looking ahead to the next release six months form now. This next release will go through its planning stages at the upcoming OpenStack Summit in Barcelona later this month and will then become generally available next February.",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/openstack_planet-1-of-1.jpg?w=738,"open-source,cloud-computing,enterprise,openstack",OpenStack’s latest release focuses on scalability and resilience
64,Romain Dillet,"Salesforce wants to make things super clear for everyone — no, the company won’t buy Twitter. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff gave an interview to the FT and said that the company ruled out the acquisition.
“In this case we’ve walked away. It wasn’t the right fit for us,” Benioff told the FT. If you were looking for an official confirmation, it can’t get more official than that.
Two weeks ago, nearly all suitors announced at the same time that they weren’t interested by Twitter after all. Google, Apple and Disney don’t want to buy Twitter anymore. Salesforce was the last remaining suitor.
While the company could have used this opportunity to lower the acquisition price, it wasn’t the case. During an investor meeting, Benioff already said that Twitter wasn’t the right fit for Salesforce. He even ended up saying “I wish Jack very well.”
But many thought Benioff was quite excited about the idea of buying Twitter. So what happened exactly? Salesforce’s largest shareholder Fidelity Investments was against the deal. And given that Fidelity owns 14 percent of Salesforce, it would have been hard to buy Twitter with the board’s approval. This is probably the wisest decision for Benioff.
Following the FT’s interview, Twitter shares are crashing once again. Shares are down 6.86 percent to $16.57. Twitter’s market cap is now $11.6 billion.

65,"Matthew Lynley,Ingrid Lunden","PayPal, the giant digital payments company that was spun off from eBay last year, has had an up-and-down relationship with the business of crowdfunding over the years, but there are some indications that this could change. We’ve been hearing that PayPal was interested in buying GoFundMe — the crowdfunding site that lets people raise money for both serious causes and lighter life events — potentially for a price above $1 billion.
It’s not clear how far conversations proceeded between the two, or if they are still active.
Both GoFundMe and PayPal said their companies do not comment on rumor or speculation; several investors and others we contacted also declined to comment. We believe conversations took place among a limited group of senior people.
Co-founded by Andrew Ballester and Brad Damphousse in 2008 in San Diego, GoFundMe has been on a growth tear. In 2015, the startup — which sits alongside others like Kickstarter, Indiegogo and Tilt, all covering different kinds of crowdfunding — raised what appears to be its only significant external funding: an undisclosed amount of money from a group of investors led by Accel and Technology Crossover Ventures (also including Iconiq Capital, Greylock and Meritech). A month later, it was revealed that Stripes invested in it, too.
As part of that transaction, the investors took a majority stake in the business, buying out the two founders in the process; installing an Accel venture partner, Rob Solomon, as CEO; and valuing the business at around $600 million. At the time, GoFundMe was estimated to be processing $100 million per month in funding for the different campaigns using its platform, growing 300 percent year-over-year.
For PayPal, a closer relationship or acquisition of a crowdfunding site would be an interesting — if surprising — turn of events.
Earlier this year, PayPal stopped offering Purchase Protection for payments made on crowdfunding platforms. The company has had a rocky relationship with the crowdfunding community, with some notable cases of freezing accounts. One of the problems for PayPal is risk management, and specifically whether it would be liable for chargebacks — that is, if a person contributing money decided that he/she wanted a refund.
At GoFundMe, PayPal was removed as a payment option altogether some time ago, replaced by a combination of Stripe and WePay. The reason given by GoFundMe was that these two allowed people to pay directly with debit or credit cards on a campaign page, and gave GoFundMe more control over the payment experience.
Earlier this month, GoFundMe took the issue of purchase protection into its own hands: it launched its own form of limited guarantee for donors and fundraisers, who respectively can claim up to $1,000 and $25,000 in the event of a campaign gone wrong. The guarantee for now is only applicable in the U.S. and Canada.
However, there are reasons why PayPal might be interested in giving crowdfunding another chance, and perhaps getting involved in it in a deeper and more serious way.
GoFundMe, which focuses on funding causes and events, may have had its share of controversy, but it’s also been a strong platform for bringing out generosity and goodwill. It’s also been very popular: one source described it as “printing money”.
A potential buyer could continue to operate GoFundMe as a separate entity. Or more strategically, the company would be a strong complement to PayPal’s existing business, which includes its ongoing relationship providing payments services to eBay, physical world point of sale, payments in third party apps through Braintree and P2P payments.

You probably have already seen plenty of campaigns for GoFundMe in your Facebook News Feed, some inspiring, maybe a few bizarre and in bad taste. Altogether, the company said in May that it has seen 25 million donors and has raised around $2 billion total.
GoFundMe, like other commerce platforms, takes a 5% share of the total transaction volume, in addition to a small additional fee through the commerce platforms it uses. Because the site basically operates on the principles of an online social network and (today) relies on outside payment providers, it has little overhead — meaning the gross margin for an operation like this is likely very high.
And integrated with PayPal, GoFundMe could become even more valuable.

66,Sarah Perez,"Google yesterday announced it will introduce a fact check tag on Google News in order to display articles that contain factual information next to trending news items. Now it’s time for Facebook to take fact-checking more seriously, too.
Facebook has stepped into the role of being today’s newspaper: that is, it’s a single destination where a large selection of news articles are displayed to those who visit its site. Yes, they appear amidst personal photos, videos, status updates, and ads, but Facebook is still the place where nearly half of American adults get their news.
Facebook has a responsibility to do better, then, when it comes to informing this audience what is actually news: what is fact-checked, reported, vetted, legitimate news, as opposed to a rumor, hoax or conspiracy theory.
It’s not okay that Facebook fired its news editors in an effort to appear impartial, deferring only to its algorithms to inform readers what’s trending on the site. Since then, the site has repeatedly trended fake news stories, according to a Washington Post report released earlier this week.
The news organization tracked every news story that trended across four accounts during the workday from August 31 to September 22, and found that Facebook trended five stories that were either “indisputably fake” or “profoundly inaccurate.” It also regularly featured press releases, blog posts, and links to online stores, like iTunes – in other words, trends that didn’t point to news sites.
Facebook claimed in September that it would roll out technology that would combat fake stories in its Trending topics, but clearly that has not yet come to pass – or the technology isn’t up to the task at hand.
In any event, Facebook needs to do better.
It’s not enough for the company to merely reduce the visibility of obvious hoaxes from its News Feed – not when so much of the content that circulates on the site is posted by people – your friends and family –  right on their profiles, which you visit directly.
Plus, the more the items are shared, the more they have the potential to go viral. And viral news becomes Trending news, which is then presented all Facebook’s users in that region.
This matters. Facebook has trended a story from a tabloid news source that claimed 9/11 was an inside job involving planted bombs. It ran a fake story about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly which falsely claimed she was fired. These aren’t mistakes: they are disinformation.
Facebook has apologized for the above, but declined to comment to The Washington Post regarding its new findings that fake news continues to be featured on the platform.
In addition, not only does Facebook fail at vetting its Trending news links, it also has no way of flagging the links that fill its site.
Outside of Trending, Facebook continues to be filled with inaccurate, poorly-sourced, or outright fake news stories, rumors and hoaxes. Maybe you’re seeing less of them in the News Feed, but there’s nothing to prevent a crazy friend from commenting on your post with a link to a well-known hoax site, as if it’s news. There’s no tag or label. They get to pretend they’re sharing facts.
Meanwhile, there’s no way for your to turn off commenting on your own posts, even when the discussion devolves into something akin to “sexual assault victims are liars” (to reference a recent story.)
Because perish the thought that Facebook would turn of the one mechanism that triggers repeat visits to its site, even if that means it would rather trigger traumatic recollections on the parts of its users instead.
There is a difference between a post that’s based on fact-checked articles, and a post from a website funded by an advocacy group. There’s a difference between Politifact and some guy’s personal blog. Facebook displays them both equally, though: here’s a headline, a photo, some summary text.
Of course, it would be a difficult job for a company that only wants to focus on social networking and selling ads to get into the media business – that’s why Facebook loudly proclaims it’s “not a media company.” 
Except that it is one. It’s serving that role, whether it wants to or not.
Google at least has stepped up to the plate and is trying to find a solution. Now it’s Facebook’s turn.
Facebook may have only unintentionally become a media organization, but it is one. And it’s doing a terrible job.",2016-10-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/fact-check-google-fb.png?w=738,"opinion,op-ed","Google added fact checking: Facebook, it’s your move now"
67,John Mannes,"Today Google added a new “fact-check” tag to its popular Google News service. The site aggregates popular timely news from multiple sources and has traditionally grouped them with tags like “opinion,” “local source” and “highly cited.” Now readers can see highlighted fact-checks right next to trending stories.
The company cites the growing prominence of fact-checking sites as one of the reasons for creating the tag. Content creators will be able to add the new fact-check tag to posts themselves using a finite set of pre-defined source labels.  
ClaimReview from Schema.org will be used to compile and organize stories offering factual background. The Schema community builds markups for structured data on the internet. The group is sponsored by Google but also has support from Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex. 
Casual readers in the U.S. and U.K. can find nuggets of fact within the expanded view of news stories on web and mobile versions of the service. Fingers crossed the new tool doesn’t result in stories claiming that the earth is really flat rising to the top of our feeds.
On a support page, Google explains that it holds the power to intervene if posts are improperly tagged as fact-checks.
“Please note, that if we find sites not following those criteria for the ClaimReview markup, we may, at our discretion, either ignore that site’s markup or remove the site from Google News.”
This may not prevent false stories from rising up in Google News, but it will make it a lot harder. It doesn’t appear that very many fact-check stories have propagated yet on Google News. We couldn’t find any in a quick visit to the site, but given the timeliness of the presidential election in the U.S., we can only expect the system to be put through its paces in the coming weeks.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-548328327.jpg?w=738,"blog,google-search,world-wide-web,digital-media",Google starts highlighting fact-checks in News
68,Matthew Lynley,"Today, Pinterest said it hit 150 million monthly active users, up from the 100 million it announced in September 2015.
However, as TechCrunch previously reported, Pinterest in 2015 was targeting that it would hit 151 million monthly active users by the end of 2015. We reported the story in October last year, and the information was used by Andreessen Horowitz to solicit limited partners to invest in a special investment fund for Pinterest earlier in the year.
With Pinterest growing by half this year, it looks like it may miss on its 2016 projections that it set earlier last year as well. Leaked documents reviewed by TechCrunch at the time also projected that Pinterest would end 2016 at 218 million monthly active users. The Wall Street Journal today also reported the company is expected to triple last year’s revenue to $300 million in 2016. That, too, falls below projected estimates of $663 million for 2016 from those leaked documents.
Again, these projections came in early 2015, and companies are constantly revising them as the years progress. Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann, in response to those projections, told The Wall Street Journal that “there were some early projections when we were just a couple months into building the business, but we’ve learned more about it.”
“Start up life is dynamic, and years old projections aren’t particularly relevant to where companies are today,” Andreessen-Horowitz partner Jeff Jordan, who is on Pinterest’s board, told TechCrunch. “We’re thrilled with Pinterest’s performance — strong continued user growth, best-in-class user engagement, and an increasingly robust platform for advertisers that’s leading to rapidly expanding revenue. We’re very excited about what’s to come.”
Revenue of $100 million for 2015, and potentially $300 million for 2016, are enviable numbers for a consumer ad-driven startup that’s only 7 years old. This isn’t really a reflection of poor performance for Pinterest, it would seem — just that the expectations may have been set a little high. Many startups are sometimes valued, to some extent, at a multiple of next year’s revenue. While Pinterest’s valuation is likely also relative to the latent pent-up marketing and user demand, as well as its growth and overhead, it would still seem the company needed to reset its expectations.

Last week, the company announced that it had brought on its first chief financial officer, former Twitter executive Todd Morgenfeld. But at that time, The Wall Street Journal reported that the company had generated $100 million in 2015, which fell below its projections of $169 million. To be sure, 50% growth year-over-year would be an enviable clip for any service with more than 100 million users (as in, Twitter), but there has always been a question as to what the upper bound of Pinterest would be beyond really powerful use cases like wedding planning or recipes.
There are a lot of potential reasons for this. With Facebook still immensely growing, scooping up new communications platforms and offering a wider array of advertising products, advertisers may be more inclined to simply stick to what they know. And the experimental budgets that these firms have, which previously may have gone to Pinterest, may be shifting to other emerging platforms like Snapchat, which has 150 million daily active users. Snapchat, a 5-year-old company, is already projecting revenue as high as between $500 million and $1 billion for 2017.
The souring on alternative platforms to Facebook and traditional advertising has been made increasingly apparent as Twitter’s valuation has dropped off a cliff. In recent weeks, reports came out that suitors have emerged (and slinked back, and emerged, and so on) to buy Twitter. That sent Twitter’s shares rocketing up, but it’s since cratered back to a market cap of around $12.5 billion. That’s not too far off from Pinterest’s valuation of $11 billion in its previous financing round.
Pinterest has increasingly offered an advertising tool that serves a larger funnel than other services. While Facebook — and likely Snapchat — are very effective at awareness and brand advertising, Pinterest has billed itself as a way for marketers to push users further and further toward conversion. It can get their attention at the awareness phase, their intention to purchase with search, and finally a conversion when they are pinning products or even purchasing them. For many kinds of products, particularly fashion, Pinterest is one of a very small set of marketing tools that touches users at every point in a purchasing life cycle.
That’s also why it’s been aggressively investing in tools surrounding visual search, including a tool that would allow users to search for products with photos from their smartphone cameras. Those sort of things are designed to capture the moment of an impulse purchase, increasingly offering alternative marketing products to its partners — and potentially to draw advertising dollars away from Facebook (or Snapchat).
In addition, Pinterest is also an online advertising service. Something like that might generally require little overhead, and to be sure, the company is generating a lot of revenue. It raised $553 million in its last financing round that valued it at $11 billion, so at face value it would appear that the company shouldn’t have any fear of running out of cash despite a lot of R&D investment and talent acquisitions — to go along with a healthy revenue stream.
What remains to be seen is whether this represents a more general trend for Pinterest. Will it being to see slowing user growth similar to Twitter, or more sustained gains like Facebook? The company’s international expansion appears to be going effectively, with 80 million of its users coming from outside the United States. There are of course different cultural quirks in different countries, but there’s clear demand for a service like Pinterest.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/pinterest-save-button.jpg?w=738,pinterest,"Pinterest hits 150M monthly users, missing earlier leaked projections in 2015"

70,Josh Constine,"Facebook wants you to lean back and watch its News Feed videos on your television with a new feature that lets you stream clips via Apple TV, AirPlay devices, Google Chromecast, and Google Cast devices. The move could help Facebook generate more video ad revenue, and increase usage time by giving people the richest possible viewing experience while at home.
The feature is now available on iOS and will come to Android soon. To use it, just find a video in the feed on your phone or desktop, tap the TV button in the top right, and then select the device you want to stream through.
You can keep scrolling through the feed and using Facebook while the video continues to stream. That allows Facebook to become both the first and second screen, a strategy Periscope is pursuing differently by allowing professional content broadcasts to be piped into Periscope and Twitter via its new Producer feature.
Facebook started testing streaming to televisions from Android back in May and iOS in August. The company actually added a way to cast via AirPlay from its iPad app back in 2011, so it’s strange that it’s taken this long to come to web and mobile.
Competitors like YouTube and Periscope already have ways to stream onto televisions, and today’s launch could make sure Facebook doesn’t fall behind. YouTube lets you create a queue of videos on the fly to watch sequentially, which seems like a sensible next feature for Facebook to add.
The goal for Facebook is always ubiquity, so it’s embracing as many viewing platforms as possible. While its most popular surface and core money maker might remain mobile for a long time, VR and TVs could give Facebook an even bigger presence in our lives.

71,Josh Constine,"Periscope is embracing professional streaming and expanding beyond amateur content shot on phones with its new Periscope Producer feature. It allows creators to generate a special URL that they can then stream to from a wide array of devices, including professional cameras, studio editing rigs, satellite trucks, desktop streaming software like OBS, games, VR headsets, drones and later, potentially 360 cameras.
Periscope Producer is Twitter’s answer to Facebook’s Live API, which similarly allows news rooms, brands, web celebrities, app developers, and others to livestream to mobile and web users. The feature could help fill Periscope and Twitter with more polished content, filling the gap between off-the-cuff Periscope phone broadcasts, and the big licensing deals Twitter has struck with the NFL and other premium content makers.
Today Twitter will start offering Periscope Producer access to more creators who apply here, with availability on iOS now and Android coming soon. Eventually Periscope wants to roll it out to all streamers as well as provide an API for programmatically initiated broadcasts.

Check out our interview with Periscope CEO and co-founder Keyvon Beykpour about the potential for Periscope Producer and its impact on Twitter’s strategy above.
“We’re taking a big step towards allowing any live broadcast, captured on mobile or otherwise, to be piped into Periscope and vicariously Twitter” Periscope co-founder and CEO Kayvon Beykpour told reporters yesterday at Twitter HQ. When asked if Periscope might eventually serve ads on Producer-based streams or help creators monetize, Beykpour said “Periscope Producer is definitely laying the groundwork to do those explorations.”
Periscope Producer has been in testing for six weeks with launch partners like ABC’s Dancing with the Stars, CBS 12, Estadao, Fusion, Louis Vuitton, The News & Documentary Emmy Awards, Walt Disney Studios, XBox UK, and TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference. You can click these links to check out what they’ve created with the feature.
If you have Producer access, you’ll be able to go into your Periscope app’s profile settings, and in Additional Sources you can generate the streaming link you’ll enter into your professional equipment. Once your stream starts recording, you’ll see a preview in Periscope from which you can publish the stream publicly. Once a stream has started, you’ll have all the typical Periscope features, like visible replies from the audience, view counts, feedback hearts, and more. Tweets hosting Periscope videos can also be embedded on the web.

Periscope Producer won’t actually help make your video itself look more professional. It’s just a new pipe. But creative content makers using their own software or equipment can create overlaid graphics, swap in images or videos, take call-ins from Skype, stream from the first-person perspective of a VR headset, or use iOS ReplayKit to broadcast live gaming footage. Creators can even make their streams or games react to viewer comments or feedback. The Periscope team built a version of Flappy Bird that goes faster and gets harder as more viewers send hearts.
“We think this is the lowest common denominator to giving the most people access to this tool” Beykpour says about building Producer as a feature available in Periscope’s app rather than an API only more experienced developers can use. The streaming link method means anyone with a desktop streaming studio app like OBS can instantly broadcast through Producer with no coding skills necessary.
For example, bedroom web TV host Alex Pettit used Producer to show sponsorship reels, bring on Skype call-ins, and display overlaid graphics like you’d see on CNN.
 
Tyler Hansen used Producer to stream from a Mount Everest VR game.
TechCrunch has been testing Periscope Producer since September, and found it to be powerful and simple to use. There were a few issues, though. Periscope Producer streams get cropped into squares within embedded tweets, which can cut off the sides of the video as seen below. Longer streams can suffer since Producer doesn’t offer a way to republish tweets with the link, so you’d have to manually promote your stream during the broadcast after it drops down Twitter’s river.
Periscope will to prove the reach of Producer streams in order to attract broadcasters. The easier the set-up and the bigger the audience, the more creators who’ll be willing to syndicate video to Periscope or make content for its specifically. It will be competing with Facebook Live video, which can now be watched on televisions, and YouTube Live, which has close ties to creators.
Getting more broadcasts piped in is critical for Twitter at a time when live video is emerging as its best bet for success. It needs to demonstrate any long-term business potential it can right now as it’s accepting acquisition bids from Salesforce and possibly others. Rather than just being the second screen for television, Producer could bring that the best video content to Twitter so it can be the first screen too.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/periscope-producer.jpg?w=738,facebook-live,"Periscope Producer lets you stream to Twitter from pro cameras, apps, VR"
72,Sarah Perez,"Tucked away inside Pandora’s rebranded app, launched yesterday, the company was hiding its first iMessage app, too. In fact, it’s the first third-party party streaming music service to launch its own iMessage extension, the company says.
That’s not to say it’s the only music-focused iMessage app, of course.
Apple Music already lets you share your favorite songs within iMessage, and Shazam recently launched a similar tool to both detect and send songs directly in iMessage.
However, Pandora’s app works a little differently.

Shazam and Apple Music’s iMessage extensions both point users to Apple Music and iTunes after a track preview is shared with the friend.
Meanwhile, Pandora’s app also lets you send a 30-second sample within a chat thread, but if the recipient likes the track, they can tap it to start a Pandora artist station based on that shared track instead.
The experience works better if both parties have the Pandora app installed, though the recipient doesn’t need to be logged in to hear the track (just start the station.)  And if the person you’re sharing with doesn’t have Pandora installed, they’ll be prompted to download it, the company notes.

Obviously, kicking of artist radio stations via a shared music clip isn’t as useful as being able to go directly to that artist and listen to their entire song, album, or catalog, as with an on-demand service. However, given that Pandora’s install base tops 78 million users, it’s more likely that your friends have Pandora on their phone rather than any other third-party music service, including Spotify, which has 40 million subscribers as of September, or even Apple Music, which announced at its iPhone 7 event that it had grown to 17 million subscribers.
In order to share songs, you simply launch the iMessage app while playing a Pandora station on your phone.
The current track will immediately pop up under “Now Playing” in the iMessage extension. Pandora’s curators will also handpick tracks that are good for sharing, including the current top hits and those that are trending.
As a bonus, the app includes a dozen stickers you can use to annotate your message. These are fairly basic – a thumbs up and thumbs down, a heart, lips, sad and happy emojis, and a few that say things like “Fire” or “Jam Alert,” among others.
There are also a couple of versions of the new Pandora logo included in the sticker pack. Why? Uh…because branding?
The iMessage extension arrived in yesterday’s app update, but like all iMessage apps, it only works if you’re running iOS 10.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/pandora-ios-icon.jpg?w=738,"pandora-radio,ios,imessage,pandora",Pandora’s new iMessage app lets you text your favorite music
73,Jordan Crook,"Ever wonder which of your selfies is best? Tinder wants to help you figure it out, with the launch of a new feature called Smart Photos. And Smart Photos, in turn, show us just how much Tinder is a big data company, meticulously collecting information about what (and who) you like and don’t like.
Smart Photos is a single toggle in the Profile section of the app. When toggled on, Tinder continuously tests your various profile photos to determine which one is most popular, and automatically serves up that photo first in your ‘deck.’
Not only does the Smart Photos algorithm take into account overall popularity of your photos, but it also accounts for the swiping patterns of people looking at your profile.
So let’s say that you have one regular selfie, one picture of you sky-diving, and one picture of you with your Schnauzer named Donald.
The pic of you and the pup gets more overall right swipes than any other picture, and is served up as the first picture (or, calling card) of your profile most of the time. But, if your profile is about to be served up to someone who typically swipes left on dogs, Tinder re-orders your photos to show the selfie or sky-diving first to that particular person.

This is where things get really interesting.
Tinder has long been quiet about what kind of information it takes into account about its users. There is the obvious stuff, like gender, age, location, bio information, and if you hook up your Instagram then that’s even more data. But Tinder has never outright said that paying attention to what each individual user is swiping right and left on within an image.
In fact, the company has always said that the most ‘successful’ photos are the ones where you’re “being yourself.”
In testing, Tinder found that folks with Smart Photos toggled on saw up to 12 percent increase in matches. But the implications go well beyond more matches on Tinder.
In more ways than one, Tinder is a big data company. With millions of engaged users, Tinder is constantly trying to figure out how to serve you the most relevant matches in your area. And on that quest, the company is likely pulling in whatever data points it possibly can about you.
This type of information — that you hate pictures of dogs or that you tend to prefer buff, blonde guys — can be used in a variety of ways that go beyond matching you with other Tinder users.
For example, Tinder has an advertising product, where ads are served directly in the feed of folks who don’t pay to use the app (Tinder Plus). You could see how information about what you find attractive could be valuable to advertisers and other entities over time, especially as the world inches toward more targeted, personalized marketing.
It’ll likely be a long while before Tinder is actively using its troves of data — about who you like, and if you’re in the majority, and all your deal-breakers — to help marketers and advertisers better sell to you. But Smart Photos tells us a lot about what kind of data Tinder is collecting about its users.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/tindermatch.jpeg?w=738,,Tinder’s new Smart Photos show just how well the app knows you
74,Josh Constine,"Tribe’s voice recognition video chat technology could make Snapchat and Facebook Messenger look outdated. That tech also attracted a $3 million seed round led by prestigious VC Sequoia, its first seed investment of the year.
Today, Tribe’s one-touch video walkie-talkie app launches a huge Version 2 update on iOS and Android powered by access to some unreleased Google voice APIs. You still hold down on a friend or group’s tile to send them a short, asynchronous video message, but now Tribe automatically adds subtitles to your video chats. And if it recognizes you’ve said a “Magic Word,” Tribe will offer a helpful related link.
Say “coffee” and Tribe offers a button to send a calendar request overlaid on your video chat. Say a celebrity’s name and it will link to their social media accounts. Products link to Amazon, locations link to maps and songs playing in the background link to Spotify.
Cyril Paglino, CEO and founder of Tribe, calls this “augmented messaging.” He built the features because, he says, “I want Tribe to be the most convenient app for me and my friends.”

Now the question is whether these features are enough to pull people away from the standard messaging apps they use, like iMessage, Facebook Messenger and Snapchat. Those all do video, but Tribe wants to make the format the default way people communicate, with text just for when you have to be quiet or share details people need to copy.
Tribe already has 500,000 downloads since its founding in August 2015, and now has 40,000 daily users. It built that community on a meager $500,000 seed round from Ludlow Ventures raised last November. But with the new cash secured in May from Sequoia, plus Ludlow, Partech Ventures and Kima Ventures, Tribe is ready to challenge the world’s most powerful chat apps. And if it doesn’t work out, I’m sure one of the tech giants would be happy to scoop up this product team.

“Professional breakdancer” isn’t on the résumé of most startup founders, but that was actually how Paglino got the idea for Tribe. While signed with Red Bull’s dance team, he traveled across Europe making friends. But trying to keep up with them all over text messengers like WhatsApp was too slow. You can’t type as fast as you can think on mobile. But you can talk.
After building and selling a startup called Wizee in his home of France, Paglino realized he could create an app to solve his typing problem. With Tribe, instead of mashing out long text messages, you simply hold down on the screen, record a video message and it’s instantly sent to friends. Paglino teamed up with some buddies, rented a hacker house in San Francisco’s secluded Dolores Heights for them to live and work from and pushed out the MVP of their app in December.
Tribe is still video first, but it’s also adding a text option just in case you need to send someone something they’ll want to copy and paste, like a phone number or address. Tribe is also branching out from just being for personal contacts to allow Telegram-style public rooms. For now you’ll have to watch every video left in the room, in order, but the startup is building feedback and ranking features to algorithmically show you the best ones first.
But the big new feature, Magic Words, could be the key to monetizing messaging without annoying its users. Affiliate links to Amazon are one obvious way Tribe could make money. There are also opportunities for tie-ins with other apps, like pushing people to certain ride-sharing services. Paglino imagines that one day you might use Tribe to get per-minute legal advice or telemedicine from a doctor.
The first step is mass traction, though, which could be difficult when everyone’s social graphs are already established on other apps. Tribe does let you pull in your Facebook friends, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Facebook cut off access for competing with it, which it’s done to messaging apps in the past. Video might be more vivid and less taxing on your thumbs, but not everything needs a face behind it, and utilitarian chat platforms could feel easier than Tribe.
What Tribe is betting on is that the shift to video will upend these chat apps like iMessage, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp that are essentially desktop IRC programs ported to mobile. And with Snapchat’s increased focus on broadcasting of Stories instead of private messaging, and the failure of Taptalk, there’s a huge open space.
Tribe and Sequoia think that gap can be filled with a video walkie-talkie that doesn’t just let you talk instead of type, but actually understands what you’re saying.
Tribe 2.0 already has one loyal user: Paglino’s mom, who’s deaf. Thanks to the subtitles, she can still see the face of her son and video chat with him even though he’s far away in Silicon Valley, chasing his dream.",2016-10-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/tribe-video-chat.png?w=738,"video-chat,tribe",Tribe augments video chat with speech recognition subtitles and suggested links
75,Lora Kolodny,"According to a new study published today from the American Civil Liberties Union, major social networks including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have recently provided user data access to Geofeedia, the location-based, social media surveillance system used by government offices, private security firms, marketers and others.
As TechCrunch previously reported, Geofeedia is one of a bevy of technologies used, secretly, by police to monitor activists and the contents of their discussions online.
The ACLU said in a blog post that both Twitter and Facebook (which owns Instagram) made some immediate changes in response to their study’s findings.
“Instagram cut off Geofeedia’s access to public user posts, and Facebook cut its access to a topic-based feed of public user posts,” the ACLU said.
The ACLU also noted in their post:
“Neither Facebook nor Instagram has a public policy specifically prohibiting developers from exploiting user data for surveillance purposes. Twitter does have a ‘longstanding rule’ prohibiting the sale of user data for surveillance as well as a Developer Policy that bans the use of Twitter data ‘to investigate, track or surveil Twitter users.’”
On Tuesday, following the publication of the ACLU findings, Twitter announced that it would “immediately suspend Geofeedia’s commercial access to Twitter data.”
A Facebook spokesperson tells TechCrunch:
“[Geofeedia] only had access to data that people chose to make public. Its access was subject to the limitations in our Platform Policy, which outlines what we expect from developers that receive data using the Facebook Platform. If a developer uses our APIs in a way that has not been authorized, we will take swift action to stop them and we will end our relationship altogether if necessary.”
It’s worth noting that Facebook’s platform policy generically limits developers.
For example, it says developers are not permitted to “sell, license, or purchase any data obtained” from Facebook or its services. And they can’t transfer data they get from Facebook, including “anonymous, aggregate, or derived data,” to any data brokers. Finally, developers are not permitted to put Facebook data into any search engines or directories without the social network’s explicit permission.
We have reached out to Geofeedia for comment but executives were not immediately available for an interview.
A public relations consultant for Geofeedia sent a lengthy statement, attributed to Geofeedia CEO Phil Harris, defending the company’s practices in general. An excerpt follows:

76,Katie Roof,"Greylock Partners is getting another $1 billion to invest in startups. The long-time venture capital firm is announcing its 15th fund, bringing the total to $3.5 billion currently under management. 
With 50 years of investing in the books, Greylock has backed industry leaders in the enterprise IT and consumer internet categories, including LinkedIn, Dropbox, Facebook and Airbnb. Their limited partners are betting that they will replicate some of this past success and continue to find startups that will become the next big thing.
“It’s been a pretty consistent strategy,” Josh Elman, partner at Greylock, tells TechCrunch. The team is always looking for “products that make people’s lives better.”
Greylock can invest anytime from the seed round to the later stages, but they generally get involved somewhere in between. Over 95% of investments in the 14th fund were series A or B and they expect to keep this approach for fund 15. 
They are looking for startups at that pivotal moment when they try to multiply “from 30 people to 1000 people,” says Elman. Greylock gets involved when teams expand “from a small early company that’s really grown large and hit some scale.” The firm has recently invested in up-and-comers like GoFundMe and musical.ly. 
In addition to enterprise and consumer businesses, Greylock plans to look at “emerging” spaces like messaging, virtual reality, machine learning and robotics. Elman cited bots and voice products like the Amazon Echo as areas that he’s particularly enthusiastic about.
Yet with many liked-minded firms hoping to invest in the top startups, it can be hard to stand out from the pack. With an investment team that includes LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Mozilla CEO John Lilly, Greylock hopes that its track record and experience will set them apart. 
Like several of the top venture firms, Greylock has in-house talent partners, who help startups find employees to build out their teams. Led by Jeff Markowitz and Dan Portillo, Greylock’s talent group looks for C-suite executives and potential hires who’ve worked in product, design or engineering.
“Greylock approaches working with companies as a true partnership – whether that’s helping with recruiting, product planning, or strategy,” said Sarah Leary, co-founder of Nextdoor. Leary, who previously worked as an associate at Greylock, believes it’s “one of the few firms where many of the partners have been in the exact same situations that we as entrepreneurs are in.”
With over 170 IPOs and 120 “profitable” acquisitions, Greylock has had numerous fruitful investments. Recent exits include Apptio, Pure Storage, Quip and TellApart.
But as with all venture capital firms, the key is to have a diverse investment portfolio, in case some of the opportunities don’t work out. Digg, Cuil and ArsDigita are amongst Greylock’s companies that didn’t pay off.
When faced with challenges, Greylock hopes its startups will turn to them for help. “We want to be somebody that they can call at any and every time of the day,” said Elman.",2016-10-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/josh-elman-and-reid-hoffman.jpg?w=738,"venture-capital,josh-elman,greylock-partners",Greylock closes $1 billion fund
77,Josh Constine,"Facebook’s latest trick to earn more revenue without drowning the News Feed is to serve ads to the 1 billion users of its Groups feature. After people reported seeing notices that “We’re testing ads in Groups,” TechCrunch inquired and Facebook confirmed that mobile and desktop versions of Groups in Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand are part of the trial.
“We have started to test delivering ads to people in Facebook Groups, and will be evaluating the response before determining how we will move forward,” Facebook told TechCrunch in a statement. The ads will look the same as News Feed ads. They’ll be targeted by Group topic as well as the standard identity-based targeting.

Facebook says it will reach maximum News Feed ad load in mid-2017, which means it needs new revenue streams to continue its revenue growth momentum that’s been going strong for years. Ramping up Instagram’s ad load and today’s launch of its new pay-per-user enterprise collaboration tool Facebook Workplace could shoulder some of the responsibility. Facebook’s also been testing new forms of Live video mid-roll ads and even Sponsored Messages from businesses in Messenger.
But the easiest way to generate extra ad dollars may be simply opening up more of Facebook’s traditional browsing to ad placement, and Groups is a massive treasure chest to unlock.
Groups was one of Facebook’s first features, starting as a non-functional way to say you support a cause or idea, from human rights to the joy of stepping on a crunchy leaf. The Groups feature was overhauled in 2010 to become forums where people could communicate, not just affiliate.
By 2014, Groups had grown to 500 million users and gotten its own standalone app. Since then, it’s doubled in size thanks to buy-and-sell Groups for commerce and other communities. From families, cliques and silly meme sharing, to hobby clubs, protest organizers and professional discussion places, Groups have blossomed into a major part of the Facebook experience.
It’s that diversity of purposes that could boost the value of Groups ads. If Facebook can find a way to reliably categorize the Groups to enhance ad targeting, it could reach people of different interests with highly relevant and lucrative ads.
Someone liking the Manchester United football team’s Page is a relatively weak targeting signal compared to whether they frequent a Group for diehard ManU fans. The latter could more accurately indicate someone is likely to buy sports merchandise. Facebook will have to learn to identify the topics of Groups that can be cryptically named or range across a mess of subjects.

450 million people now use buy-and-sell groups each month. Facebook just launched a dedicated Marketplace feature for them. These Groups could be powerful hosts for advertisers, too. For example, they could allow an electronics brand to show ads to users browsing a group for selling TVs or computers. Of course, the social network will have to avoid showing so many ads that they anger visitors and discourage usage.
Facebook Groups flourished by contributing a middle ground for sharing between News Feed broadcasting and private messaging. Now after a decade, Groups will start contributing to Facebook’s bottom line. In case it wasn’t clear, Facebook is willing to play the lonnnnnnng game when it comes to monetization.",2016-10-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/fb-groups-ads.png?w=738,"facebook-ads,facebook-groups","Facebook tests ads in Groups, its next potential cash cow"
78,Ingrid Lunden,"After 20 months in a closed beta under the working title Facebook at Work, (as we predicted it would the other week) today Facebook is finally bringing its enterprise-focused messaging and social networking service to market under a new name, Workplace.
It’s not only armed with a new brand: Workplace is launching with a new kind of pricing model based on Facebook-style monthly active user metrics; and some pretty big ambitions after picking up 1,000 organizations as customers while still in its free, pilot mode (up from 100 a year ago).
Workplace — which is launching as a desktop and mobile app with News Feed, Groups both for your own company and with others, Chat direct messaging, Live video, Reactions, translation features, and video and audio calling — is now opening up to anyone to use, and the operative word here is “anyone”.
To really gain critical mass for the product and help it stand out from others in the market, Facebook is courting not just companies’ white-collar, desk-dwelling “knowledge workers” who typically buy and use enterprise messaging software.
It also wants to bring on the much wider global wedge of employees who serve customers, maintain machines or otherwise roam as part of their jobs — people who may already be using Facebook in their non-working life, but who have rarely been co-opted into an organization’s wider digital collaboration efforts in the past.
Workplace is opening for business long after a number of competing services have made their mark and picked up significant traction — popular rival software in the area of enterprise communication and messaging includes the likes of Slack, Yammer (now part of Microsoft), Chatter from Salesforce, Hipchat and Jive, among many others.
There are even a range of lesser-known business messaging apps built specifically for “non-desk” workers, including Zinc (originally called Cotap), Beekeeper and more.
Why the delay? “We had to build this totally separate from Facebook, and we had to test and get all the possible certifications to be a SaaS vendor,” Julien Codorniou, director of Workplace, explained in an interview in London, where the development of the product was based. Those developments are still happening. He told me that as of last week Workplace joined the US/EU Privacy Shield. 
The other reason has to do with the kinds of companies and non-traditional SaaS buyers it was targeting. “We wanted to see how it would work in very conservative industries and government agencies,” he said. “We had to test the product in every possible geography and industry, especially the most conservative ones. We feel we are ready for primetime now.”

Workplace may not be first to the market, but it’s hoping to woo people with a few twists.
One of these comes in the form of pricing. Enterprise software companies typically follow a few standard business models: they include charging per-seat, based on a certain number of users at your company; in larger tiers based on the same principle of user numbers; based on feature sets; and under a freemium model, where you get a small number of basics for a small group, with the understanding that you soon be ramping up to more features in the paid tiers.
Facebook has thrown most of this out of the window and is opting instead to take a page from its own book of metrics.
It’s going to offer everyone the same features, and charge for Workplace by monthly active users — defined in this case as opening up and using Workplace at least once in the month. Facebook will charge $3 per user per month for the first 1,000 users; $2 for the next 1,001-10,000; and $1 for any MAUs above that.
(As a pricing point of comparison, Slack charges $8 and $15 per active user per month for two tiers of features, with the price going down if you pay annually. It has yet to launch its enterprise tier for extra-large organizations.)
The reason for the pricing by MAUs, and at these competitive prices, was made for a couple of reasons. For starters, it means that what is being bought becomes more transparent to the customer.
But also: Facebook then holds itself more accountable for the service. You pay only for what you are actually using, and Facebook essentially only gets paid for how engaging it’s managed to make the service, much like ads that run on the platform.
“We wanted to build enterprise software the Facebook way,” said Codorniou.
Another interesting aspect of the pricing concerns the tiers of numbers Facebook is throwing around. The company would not give us a total number of MAUs for Workplace as of today. But it is clear that the aim is to target very large companies and other organizations with this product.
Some of the early customers that Facebook has signed up have included 36,000 employees at the carrier Telenor, and 100,000 employees at the Royal Bank of Scotland, and today Facebook’s announcing more such as Danone (100,000 employees), Starbucks (238,000 employees) and Booking.com (13,000).
It also has organizations like the Royal National Institute for the Blind, Oxfam, and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore.
While Facebook is charging for Workplace, making tons of money from it doesn’t appear to be its actual goal — not at first, at least. The goal, Codorniou said, is to gain some critical mass for the product.
“We’re going to grow Workplace like Instagram and Messenger,” he said. “Before you even think about monetization, we want to spend the first years growing it. We are obsessed with growth.”
Another way that Facebook might just succeed with at least getting people to try out Workplace, if not switch over to using it permanently, is based on the fact that works just like Facebook itself.
With the main consumer service now pushing past 1.7 billion monthly active users, it’s likely that a good portion of a company’s employees will either already know the service, if not already use it.
This will mean people will be instantly familiar with how the product looks and works, which in the closed beta has translated into a very high amount of engagement with the product. Among the 1,000 companies and other organizations that have been using Workplace in its closed beta, there have been no fewer than 100,000 user groups already created.
As we have written about Facebook at Work in the past, much of Workplace will essentially look just like the Facebook you already know and probably use today.
There is a News Feed. There are Groups that you can build within your own company and with colleagues at other organizations that you work with regularly. There is a Messenger equivalent that Facebook refers to as “Chat”.
There is Live video as well as group video and audio calling. You can comment on posts with multi-emotional Reactions and there are automatic translation features.
There are also some partnerships from day one that speak to the aim of working with big enterprises that may already be using other services. They include the likes of Okta, OneLogin and Ping for log-ins and identity services, Box for storage, and integrators like Deloitte and Sada Systems.
But generally speaking, there isn’t a long list of integrations that will work with Workplace from the start, a la Slack, which lets you bring in work and data from hundreds of other apps with short-cut slash-commands.
Codorniou said that this was intentional.
“We wanted to talk about an easy to use product and democratic pricing with customers,” he said. “When I talked to the CEO of Danone, whose 100,000 employees include many people without computers and desks, usage and engagement were more important than whether Workplace integrated with Workday or Quip.” 
(Interesting sidenote to this: for now, Cordorniou told me that Facebook requires all potential sales partners and integrators to actually sign up for Workplace and use it before they are allowed to work on it. “I don’t see how you can sell it without using it first,” he said.)
From what I understand, it’s likely that Slack-style integrations, along with other bells and whistles like bots and the multitude of other features that have invaded Messenger, are likely to come down the line very soon, with the first of them making an appearance at Facebook’s F8 conference this coming spring.
For now, the message to the market may be big enough: Facebook has become a de facto platform for billions of consumers globally to communicate with each other in the digital world, and now it is aggressively moving to be the same in the working world.",2016-10-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/04_workplace_homepage_desktop.png?w=738,,Workplace by Facebook opens to sell enterprise social networking to the masses
79,Josh Constine,"Snapchat is fighting back against Instagram Stories, which rocketed to 100 million daily users by spotlighting the cloned feature atop the feed. To make Snapchat more “friends first,” it’s moving friends’ Stories above Discover where they used to be to make sure you don’t miss people you care about.
And to make it easier to watch all your favorites friends’ Stories without the boring people in between, Snapchat is eliminating auto-advance, which automatically moved you on to the next reverse chronological Story when you finished watching the last one.
Auto-advance will be replaced with Story Playlist, a new feature that lets you tap the thumbnails next to multiple Stories you want to load, then watch them all back-to-back by hitting the big “play” button at the bottom. This essentially formalizes an emergent behavior where users would scroll down tapping Stories to start them loading, then scroll through again to watch each, one at a time, once they’d loaded.
The updates are rolling out to some Android users today and all iOS and Android users soon.
So what will happen to the Snap Ads that Snapchat inserted between the auto-advance Stories? Those mid-roll ads will now appear mixed into Story Playlists you watch. But there’s also a new ad placement. If you decide to just watch one story at a time, Snapchat may append a post-roll Snap Ad at the end.
This way, Snapchat can earn money no matter how you watch Stories, either singularly or in bulk. That’s important, considering the company is reportedly planning to IPO as soon as March at a $25 billion or higher valuation. Snapchat needs to prove it has plenty of diverse revenue streams to convince Wall Street of its financial security.
 
Though Instagram admitted its Stories are a blatant rip-off of Snapchat Stories, the product’s rapid ascent could hamper growth for Snapchat. Instagram made the feature unmissable by planting it smack-dab at the top center of its main feed, rather than hiding it in a separate tab. By comparison, that made Snapchat’s Stories list that shows professionally made Discover channels at the top above people you follow seem less about friends and more cumbersome.
After two years, Discover doesn’t need that prominent cross-promotion above Stories any more. It already has its own page in Snapchat. The move might rattle publishers who’ve invested heavily in producing unique Snapchat Discover content, since the move shows Snapchat isn’t afraid to demote them. The move is reminiscent of Facebook’s recent News Feed changes that ranks “friends first” above publishers. Discover is nice, but most people open Snapchat to see people they know, and the product wasn’t properly reflecting that.
Now Snapchat’s priorities are clear: fending off Instagram and proving its money-making potential before it goes public.",2016-10-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/snapchat-ads.png?w=738,,"Snapchat launches post-roll ads, Story Playlist that loads favorites in bulk"
80,Mike Butcher,"InnoGames, the Hamburg-based developer and publisher of successful browser games such as Elvenar, Tribal Wars, The West, and Grepolis, is going to the next level.
MTG (Modern Times Group), the Swedish digital entertainment company, has acquired a 35% stake in the company for an estimated $100 million, valuing the company at $287 million. MTG also has the option to acquire a 51% stake in the future. InnoGames has over 150 million registered players, and half of new players come from mobile devices, with many more mobile titles planned.
The move is a win for the London-based Eight Roads Ventures fund, formerly known as Fidelity Growth Partners.
Davor Hebel, partner in Eight Roads, told TechCrunch the games company is on a tear, continuing on a path towards €1bn of revenue.
It’s also clearly a big win for InnoGames which was bootstrapped until raising a B round from Eight Roads, and a win for Hamburg which is not so well-known on the European or Global tech scene as a hub.
Hendrik Klindworth, InnoGames CEO and co-founder, said: “We have scored major success with our live games and are now focusing on the development of several new mobile first titles… MTG’s international presence, understanding of storytelling entertainment, and commitment to IP development and building engaged user communities will bring our games to even larger audiences around the world.”
MTG is best known for its esports and MPN businesses (ESL and DreamHack), so this adds an extra arm to their business.
InnoGames has 400 employees working on games like Elvenar, Tribal Wars 2, and Forge of Empires. Since none of these have a an esports element, you can expect MTG to begin looking at how that can be brought into the strategy.

81,Ingrid Lunden,"A changing of the guard is underway at Spotify, the streaming music service with 40 million paying users and over 100 million overall that competes with the likes of Apple Music, Google Music, Pandora and now Amazon. Co-founder Martin Lorentzon announced (in Swedish) that he is stepping down as chairman of the company. Co-founder Daniel Ek will take on the role alongside his other position as CEO, while Lorentzon will downgrade to the position of vice-chairman.
Spotify has confirmed the moves to us but has provided no further comment.
Lorentzon — pictured, right, from his own Spotify profile (his exec bio has been taken down for now it seems for updating) — has a number of other roles in the Swedish business world. Among them he is a board member at Telia Sonera, Sweden’s national carrier, which took a $115 million investment at an $8.53 valuation in the company in June 2015 (giving Spotify its last and most current valuation).
Ek, meanwhile, appears to be consolidating more power and authority at the company. After the company’s chief revenue officer, Jeff Levick, departed the company in October, the subscriber team that reported to Levick now report to Ek as part of a wider reorganization. (Ek’s not taking on all CRO duties: the sales team that also reported to Levick now report to CFO Barry McCarthy.)
The changes come as we hear increasing talk of an IPO for the company, which was founded in Stockholm but incorporated in the UK and with offices in New York (where Daniel Ek himself is based). The latest we’ve heard from sources is that the company is planning file by the end of this year, with a public listing in 2017.
If the appointment of Ek in Lorentzon’s place is a permanent arrangement, it could be a sign that Spotify is simplifying its structure ahead of a public listing, potentially in the U.S., where the company has been gradually shifting its business centre.
To be fair, there have been rumors of a Spotify IPO for years now.
In January 2016, Spotify quietly went out to raise an “opportunistic” $500 million in convertible notes from Swedish investors, with those notes specifically pegged to an IPO plan. If the IPO happened within a year of the investment, investors would get a 17.5% discount on shares; if it’s more than a year away, the discount will increase 2.5 percentage points every six months. At the time, Spotify had been considering a joint listing in Stockholm and the U.S.
In March, the company confirmed another whopping $1 billion in debt with even stronger terms. Investors TPG and Dragoneer can convert their debt to equity at a 20% discount of whatever share price Spotify sets for an eventual IPO. If Spotify didn’t IPO within a year, that discount goes up 2.5% every extra six months. That’s on top of the 5% annual interest Spotify would pay on the debt, and 1% more every six months up to a total of 10%.
In other words, you can see some of what might be driving a potential Spotify IPO to come sooner rather than later.
The company in the meantime has been making a lot of moves to solidify its position as a leader in the market for streamed music services. When it announced 40 million paying users in September, that figure revealed that at the moment Spotify has been growing its paid user base at a rate faster than Apple Music, which is shaping up to be a chief rival. However, the company is still loss-making: sales last year (the most recent that are available) totalled €1.9 billion ($2 billion), but Spotify’s operating loss was €184.5 million ($203 million).
Perhaps because of that race for more paying users and higher margins, Spotify has been driving hard on growth. It has been launching ever more features to appeal to later (less diehard music fan) adopters and help them better engage with the service. Automatic, AI-based playlists such as Spotify’s latest Daily Mix selection help with discovery and mean you don’t always have to know just what it is you want to hear.
And, notably, Spotify has also been eyeing up ways of adding in users and new features to its service by way of acquisition. Spotify has so far disclosed three acquisitions in the last year — CrowdAlbum, Cord Project and Soundwave.
Reportedly and maybe most importantly, it is also looking to buy Soundcloud, the “YouTube for audio” that is based out of Berlin.
This could not only bring in millions of new users, but also a whole business around original content, since Soundcloud is perhaps the best known platform for musicians to post their own music directly to the world, with those original tracks and remixes forming a very large chunk of the 125 million tracks it has on its platform today (to compare, Spotify and other streaming services of its kind have about 30 million licensed tracks).
For what it’s worth, we have heard that Spotify+Soundcloud is the real deal, and may still be in play.",2016-10-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/screen-shot-2014-05-21-at-11-19-55-am.png?w=738,,"Spotify co-founder Martin Lorentzon steps down as chairman, CEO Daniel Ek steps up"

83,Mike Butcher,"This weekend Lebara — the mobile network business which has become a universally recognised brand for the world’s migrant community — is to enter the international money transfer market, potentially putting the squeeze on tech newcomers like Transferwise and Azimo. Given that migrants are the primary market for international money transfers, this could hinder the growth of startups in the space. But it may also help by switching on a new audience to other players.
Lebara Money will be leveraging its association with Lebara Mobile which was built specifically to help migrants get cheaper phone calls to back home around the globe.
As well as Transferwise, the competition for “Lebara Money” will be incumbents Western Union, MoneyGram and normal banks. Lebara Money is entering the market with a twist however, offering both competitive FX rates, but also a ‘rate lock’ feature for even small sums. Rate locks are normally offered on large international transfers and therefore tend to be the preserve of wealthier clients.
Rate locks deal with fluctuations in exchange rates, something which the UK knows all too much about right now.
The service will lock in a rate for up to 30 days for amounts as low as £100. Lebara Money is also hoping its low, upfront fee for the lock (0.5% – 1% depending on the destination) will attract a new customer base.
Here’s an example: Over the recent Brexit referendum someone planning in June to send £1,000 home to India in July could have locked in a pre-Brexit rate on June 22nd and been £147 better off when the transfer was made on July 6th.
Ratheesan Yoganathan, founder and chairman of the Lebara Group says: “Migrants have distinct financial needs that are often poorly served currently, if even recognised by the mainstream industry.”
Initially the Saturday launch will be aimed at migrants in the UK and Europe.
Azimo has raised $46.59M to date and Transferwise has raised $116.37M.
Lebara was founded by Yoganathan, Rasiah Ranjith Leon and Baskaran Kandiah in in 2001 after the founders had the idea at an airport cafe. The company’s first product was international telephone calling cards, but in 2004 it launched the first low-cost international service, selling SIM cards using mobile carrier partners.",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/mobile-payment-transfer.png?w=738,,"Giant migrant brand Lebara to launch against FX startups like Transferwise, Azimo"
84,Steve O'Hear,"Back in the days when I did a startup I almost de-railed our VC funding after discovering my passport had expired. Without it I couldn’t pass the anti-money laundering checks imposed on the fancy and overpriced London law firm we’d hired. Then we almost failed to open a bank account so we could actually receive the money because we were unable to fly over all of our investors from Eastern and Central Europe to pass ID checks in person. The takeaway: compliance is a pain in the ass.
Enter ComplyAdvantage, a London-based startup that claims to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to help firms manage compliance obligations and at reduced cost. The young company is announcing $8.2 million in Series A funding led by Balderton Capital, money it plans to plough into growth across Europe and the U.S., including opening a New York office this week.
Founded by Charles Delingpole, who previously founded Market Invoice, ComplyAdvantage originally launched to help a small number of businesses meet complex anti-money laundering (AML) and counter financing of terrorism (CFT) requirements. It has since developed its product to also cover things like Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) lists and other risk and compliance areas that are hard to scale.
“The way organisations screen and monitor their customer relationships to comply with sanctions regulations and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing risk is fundamentally broken,” ComplyAdvantage VP of Sales & Marketing Stephen Ball tells me over email. “ComplyAdvantage is here to help compliance and risk professionals fix it”.
“Legacy technologies are outdated, expensive and inefficient, typically generating large amounts of manual work in the form of unnecessary risk alerts for the team to review,” he adds, citing as an example a customer having the same name as a completely different Politically Exposed Person. “Furthermore, the criminals are winning, with existing solutions having limited impact on actually reducing financial crime”.
That, argues Ball, has left compliance officers jaded. Originally attracted to the role of fighting crime, they find themselves often doing a box-ticking exercise that is ineffective but designed to keep the companies they work for on the right side of the regulators, even if that often fails too. Meanwhile, regulator fines are kind of expected and baked into the pricing models of financial services.
To fix this, ComplyAdvantage is betting that AI and machine learning can help compliance scale properly and says the startup is part of a “regtech revolution” that is coming to financial services. “ComplyAdvantage are at the forefront unleashing the power of AI and ML to change the way compliance is done,” says the VP of Sales & Marketing.
Adds Tim Bunting, General Partner at Balderton Capital, in a statement: “We believe that this is one of the few remaining large industries that is still ripe for digital disruption. We are thrilled to be backing Charles and his team, they are well on their way to changing the way companies can understand and monitor risk around their clients. Their mission is truly exciting, and relevant to all businesses.”",2016-10-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/charles.jpg?w=738,,ComplyAdvantage raises $8.2M Series A to help firms manage compliance
85,Mike Butcher,"Back in August there were clear signs that Hyperloop One (HO) might be building its super fast transportation system at the Jebel Ali port in Dubai. The Royalty-led government of the United Arab Emirates and the CEO of DP World, Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, appeared to be entertaining the idea of a submerged, floating Hyperloop to shift cargo at lightning speed from the port, having spent billions on the new port terminals.
Then in September, at TechCrunch Disrupt, HO investor Shervin Pishevar: The first Hyperloop will likely be built overseas. Then last month the UAE hosted the “Build Earth Live” contest next month focusing on the development of the Hyperloop system between Dubai and Fujairah.
But now we know more about how HO is going to implement its project in the country, and it’s going to be in close cooperation with a brand new government-backed accelerator. As a result we can expect to see the first Hyperloop on the planet carrying cargo, not people.
Dubai Future Accelerators (DFA) has been created by the UAE, alongside seven government entities which have committed to pilot cutting edge technologies in the country. The DFA is an initiative of the Dubai Future Foundation and part of the Future Endowment Fund, worth $275 Million, and designed to invest in innovation which will shape the future of the UAE’s most important industrial sectors, including, of course, transportation.
What will happen now is a 12-week program which has taken over 2,000 applications from 73 countries. Less than 1% of the applicants were selected, says DFA, but over 30 companies have been selected to take part in the program.
As well as Hyperloop One, other companies are joining. These include Next (a modular mass transportation solution); ConsenSys (the Ethereum / blockchain software company that builds developer tools, decentralized applications, and enterprise solutions); Construction Robotics, (literally a robot for automated construction) and Honeywell, the Fortune 100 company, with plans to build a new way of delivering healthcare at home.
H.E. Mohammed Al Gergawi, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Future Foundation says the aim is to “co-create solutions to global challenges and then share them with the world.”
The companies will share a new purpose-built facility alongside the seven government departments.
Here’s Hyperloop One on their road-trip to the country:

86,Steve O'Hear,"Headed up by Kaidi Ruusalepp, who was previously CEO of the Nasdaq Tallinn stock exchange, Estonia’s Funderbeam is on a mission to build what she calls a “funding and trading engine for growth companies”.
Providing tools to research, fund and trade in private companies, the bigger vision is to build something akin to a “stock exchange” for startups based on blockchain technology. To make that vision a reality, Funderbeam has raised $2.6 million in further funding.
Leaning the round is Draper Associates, Thomson Reuters, and IQ Capital, with participation from an array of previous Funderbeam backers, such as 3TS Capital Partners. Notable other investors include Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, and David Braben, the CEO and Founder of Frontier Developments.
“There’s too much complexity in the pre-IPO/private market. Companies used to go to exchanges for growth financing, but looking at the startup funding trends, like Uber raising €3.5 billion in just one round, plus the cost structure of getting listed and being listed, it does not make sense anymore,” Ruusalepp tells me.
“Today growth companies look to the stock markets only as a serious option for exits. On top, early-stage and growth funding has grown to unimagined heights, but it is one of the most illiquid assets classes. Once you’re in, you hardly get out”.
This of course is where Funderbeam comes in. The platform is part research tool — the first part of the problem the startup set out to solve when it launched in 2013 — and part investment platform, providing a way for startups to raise funding and for investors to invest in burgeoning and potentially high growth companies.
But to truly solve the liquidity problem, there needs to be a transparent and trustworthy platform for secondary trading, and one that can work across borders. And this is where Funderbeam’s nascent trading feature comes into play. It lets shareholders sell their stake in a startup, either one that was originally funded via the platform or potentially any that they have permission to trade.
“Using blockchain technology we aim to show the stock markets how technology can turn the sector around. For the first time ever, early stage investors can choose both how much to invest, and how long to keep the investment,” explains Ruusalepp. “Or to put it in a fruitier way,” she says, “imagine if Bloomberg, Angellist and Nasdaq had a baby”.
Blockchain technology, argues Ruusalepp, provides the transparency needed to help address trust issues inherent with any trading system and that digital technology trumps paper records that still hamper stock exchanges and databases of company ownership.
“There is a coming shift in trust [that is seeing] customers start trusting technology instead of people and institutions,” she says. “As the internet is for exchanging data and information, blockchain is being placed one level higher – it is used to exchange values. It’s like a global public notary registering and keeping an eye on all global transactions on assets”.
That “fundamental vision and usage opportunity” for blockchain is something Funderbeam and its investors are embracing. “We decided to test it, to be the first one who has built a securities trading platform on the blockchain,” adds Ruusalepp.",2016-10-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/funderbeam-team-1-of-1-1.jpg?w=738,,Estonia’s Funderbeam is building a blockchain-based “stock exchange” for startups
87,Frederic Lardinois,"HoloLens, Microsoft’s $3,000 mixed-reality goggles (or “the world’s first self-contained holographic computer” in Microsoft’s parlance), was only available in the U.S. and Canada so far. Today, however, the company announced that it will also start selling the devices in Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Preorders start today and the devices will ship in late November.
We hear that Microsoft’s yield for producing HoloLenses is higher than it expected, so the company is now also able to bring it to new regions faster than it expected. What’s gating an even wider rollout, though, is that Microsoft still needs to get its certifications from the international equivalents of the U.S.’s FCC as it enters new markets. It’s worth noting that even though it’s officially only rolling out in a few European countries, the single European market pretty much means anybody in Europe will be able to get a HoloLens now.
Like in the U.S. and Canada, potential buyers will be able to choose between the standard $3,000 Development Edition or the $5,000 Commercial Suite that includes better support, as well as added security and device management features for enterprise users.
“When we set out to pioneer the mixed reality category we knew that many of the best innovations would be discovered when others got their hands on the technology,” wrote Alex Kipman, Technical Fellow, Microsoft Windows and Devices Group, in today’s announcement. “It has been quite inspiring to see what our partners have built and what individual developers have created. Together, we have only scratched the surface for what mixed reality can do. I can’t wait to see what happens next as we welcome these new countries to our holographic landscape.”
It’s worth remembering that HoloLens is only one aspect of what Microsoft calls “Windows Holographic.” The overall idea here is to also enable third-party manufacturers to use Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system to build their own mixed reality — or even virtual reality — headsets and peripherals over time.",2016-10-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_20160330_184536.jpg?w=738,"europe,hololens","Microsoft starts selling its HoloLens in Germany, France, UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand"
88,Natasha Lomas,"The U.K. government has agreed on an amendment to draft surveillance legislation aimed at strengthening the public perception of privacy safeguards by adding a statement of priority to the face of the legislation.
The Investigatory Powers bill, which continues to attract controversy on account of the scope of the powers it sets out, is the government’s attempt to cement an overarching operational framework for state security agency and law enforcement surveillance powers, replacing a patchwork of antiquated legislation that is currently being used to authorize intercepts and other intrusive investigatory measures.
Lord Janvrin, a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), introduced the amendment in a report-stage session on the IP bill in the House of Lords today. He noted this was one of the ISC’s recommendations when it delivered a critical report on the draft bill earlier this year.
The ISC surprised commentators with its critical report on the IP bill, given how much emphasis the security-cleared committee placed on the importance of enshrining privacy protections in a piece of legislation aimed at expanding security agency powers.
“We recommended that privacy should form the backbone of the legislation, around which the exceptional, intrusive powers are then built,” Lord Janvrin said today.
“This recommendation was then to underline at the very outset of the bill that there is a delicate balance to be struck between an individual’s right to privacy and the exceptional powers needed by the intelligence agencies to ensure our safety and security.”
And while he added that, in his view, the bill has seen “substantial changes” and “significant improvements in the protection afforded to privacy” — flagging up the government agreeing to add a “clause in general duties in regard to privacy” into the legislation — he said the aim of the amendment is “simply to reinforce the government’s approach” by including a more visible pro-privacy statement.
Speaking for the government today, Lord Howe said it was willing to agree to the amendment.
“The ISC still feels there is merit in placing a simple statement right at the very forefront of the legislation to provide additional clarity that there should be no doubt that privacy protection remains a fundamental priority. On that basis I am happy to support it,” said Lord Howe.
However another amendment also aimed at bolstering privacy and civil liberties protections — by proposing the creation of a U.S.-style Privacy and Civil Liberties Board — was shot down in flames on the floor of the House of Lords.
The amendment, introduced by Lib Dem Peers Lord Paddick and Lord Strasburger, was attacked from all sides of the house, including by other Lib Dem peers.
Criticisms included that the U.S. equivalent body is ineffective; that such a board would merely duplicate other oversight roles — such as the bill’s Investigatory Powers Commissioner and the existing role of independent reviewer of terrorism legislation; that it would be costly; and even that it would be dangerous to allow security-cleared material to be seen by an external body.
One peer dubbed the idea “an expensive and ill-conceived quango” and “a risk to national security.” Another described it as “one of the worst proposals I’ve seen in the area of National Security.”
While the Lib Dem’s Lord Campbell of Pittenweem also condemned the proposal, arguing it is “simply rehearsing the existing law,” and dismissing Paddick’s argument in favor of it — that the government, under former Home Secretary (now PM) Theresa May, had previously said it would create such a body — by claiming the proposed legislative framework at that point was entirely different.
“The original proposal, which is now contained in this amendment, was made against a wholly different statuary framework and therefore when one’s considering its necessity one must look at its necessity against the background of the statutory framework which this bill now encompasses,” he argued, adding: “[Paragraphs in the proposed amendment] add nothing to the obligations already incumbent on the security services.”
Under attack from all sides, Paddick and Strasburger withdrew the amendment.
An attempt by Green peer, Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb, to pass amendments seeking to bolster the bill’s “double lock” authorization mechanism and further improve safeguards for when surveillance powers can be utilized by state actors also did not succeed.
“One of the biggest problems in every single power the Bill gives and sometimes creates is the lack of a reasonable suspicion — lack of a threshold that is absolutely clear for surveillance powers to be authorised for the purpose of preventing and detecting crime. Intrusive powers can be authorised to prevent and detect serious crime, but this general purpose is left wide open to broad interpretation and abuse without requiring the authorising authority to verify the existence of that reasonable suspicion of criminality,” argued Baroness Jones.
“A requirement of reasonable suspicion, when the purpose of preventing and detecting serious crime is invoked, would protect people and prevent the abusive surveillance of law-abiding citizens that we have seen in the past, without unduly limiting legitimate use of surveillance powers.”
Lacking support for her amendment, she withdrew it.
One Labour-backed intervention did inflict a defeat on the government by passing an amendment it does not support. But not on the issue of general privacy concerns; rather relating specifically to costs for victims of phone hacking (a recommendation from the Leveson enquiry into media practices). Peers were angry the government had not yet enacted the relevant section of the Leveson report — and pushed to inject in into the IP bill via an amendment.
Lord Howe also detailed government amendments that he said aim to put “beyond doubt” the importance of taking “particular care” in relation to sensitive communications, such as confidential journalistic material, by making it clear public authorities “should have regard to the human rights implications — in the widest sense — of interfering with communications that attract particular sensitivity”.
The bill has been criticized as a threat to journalists’ sources.
Concerns also continue to be raised about the risks the bill poses to legal professional privilege.
Scrutiny of the IP bill continues in the House of Lords, with the government aiming to have it pass into law this year.

89,Romain Dillet,"Netatmo’s first device was a sophisticated weather station. But it’s not for everyone. Chances are you don’t need to know the historical trend when it comes to the humidity in your house. That’s why the company is releasing the Healthy Home Coach, an indoor device that lets you see stats about your home at a glance.
In many ways, the Healthy Home Coach looks similar to the indoor module of the weather station. But it comes with a new mobile app that focuses on quick glanceable information — and it doesn’t have an outdoor weather module. You won’t get inundated with numbers, you’ll just see if your home is doing fine right now.
The device tracks four things — indoor air quality, humidity, temperature and noise. Air quality in particular is something that many weather stations don’t offer yet. Being able to see whether you should open your windows for a few minutes could be useful.
Finally, you can set up different profiles. For instance, you can make your device more sensitive by saying that a baby or a child with asthma sleeps in this room.
The Healthy Home Coach will cost $99. If you want, you can buy multiple devices for multiple rooms. It is available today. It’s pretty cool to see that Netatmo is launching many new devices, solidifying its reputation as a solid French hardware startup.",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/nhhc_2016_kitchen_web.jpg?w=738,"france-newsletter,netatmo",Netatmo launches an indoor climate monitor

We’ve already announced many great speakers and we’re glad to say Steve Hilton is joining. He’s not just the co-founder and CEO of Silicon Valley political crowdfunding and data start-up Crowdpac — he’s a former advisor to the previous British Prime Minister, David Cameron, and was a vociferous advocate of the UK leaving the European Union. We’re sure he’ll have a lot to say about that, as the UK and the EU try to define their future relationship.
He also teaches at Stanford University’s Institute of Design (d.school), and is the author of the Sunday Times bestseller More Human – Designing a World Where People Come First.
Steve was previously Senior Advisor to UK Prime Minister David Cameron, where he helped lead the implementation of the British government’s domestic reform program. Prior to the 2010 General Election, as David Cameron’s head of strategy, Steve is credited with helping to develop the ideas associated with the modernization of the British Conservative Party.
Before working in politics, Steve was co-founder of Good Business, a corporate responsibility consulting firm, and The Good Cook, an award-wining London restaurant. He lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife and young family. And 12 chickens!

91,Romain Dillet,"French startup Payfit wants to modernize the good old paychecks in France. After just a few months, the company just raised $5.6 million (€5 million) from Otium Venture and Xavier Niel.
Payfit officially started in April 2016. And it looks like many companies were waiting for a product like this one given today’s funding round. Geoffroy Roux de Bézieux, Jean-Daniel Guyot, Oleg Tscheltzoff and TheFamily also invested in this round.
“Right now in France, you need to have dedicated people working exclusively on payroll functions. And if you outsource them, you lose control,” co-founder and CEO Firmin Zocchetto told me.
Payroll departments use outdated software with expensive licenses. Payfit is a software-as-a-service, meaning that everything happens in your browser, it always gets updated and you pay every month depending on the size of your company.
This alone is a big change in France as there aren’t many solutions to manage paychecks. That’s why it can get really expensive, even for a tiny company, to pay your employees.
Zocchetto walked me through the product and I was quite impressed with the interface and general philosophy. Even though I’m no HR manager, I could see myself using something like Payfit to manage contracts, salaries, vacations, tickets restaurant meals and more.
On the other end of the equation, employees can log into Payfit to download paychecks and request a vacation. And if there’s an issue, you know that you can directly talk to someone in your company about it as your company doesn’t rely on an outsourced payroll service bureau.
So far, 250 companies have signed up to Payfit, such as Heetch, Sellsy, Nestor or Aircall. They pay €39 per month and €11 per month per employee — traditional competitors tend to be more expensive than that.
The product is only available in France as this type of product tends to be very specific to one market. But Firmin told me that the startup could eventually expand to other European countries.
Payfit looks like a simple idea on paper, but it’s such an unsexy industry that there hasn’t been a lot of competition. Moreover, every company needs to manage their payroll — Payfit isn’t just something that is “nice to have.” And you don’t have to keep up with the ever-changing French law because Payfit handles it for you — this is also a good selling point.",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/moneyhands.jpg?w=738,france-newsletter,Payfit grabs $5.6 million to manage French payrolls
92,Romain Dillet,"Apple is on a research & development spree! The company has announced a bunch of new R&D centers over the past few months, and R&D spendings have skyrocketed. This time, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the company plans to open a new center in Japan during a visit in Tokyo, according to Xinhua.
This isn’t the first time we’re hearing about a new R&D center in Japan. Previous reports have indicated that Apple was building a new R&D center for 2016 or 2017.
Cook met with Japan’s prime minister Shinzo Abe to discuss all things Apple and Japan. Later at a press conference, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga reported that Apple would complete its R&D center in December.
So what is this R&D center anyway? Located in Yokohama, the building used to be a Panasonic factory. Apple has taken over the building and transformed it into an R&D center.
This way, Apple can more easily hire talented Japanese engineers. It’s unclear what the Japanese team is going to work on.
Overall, in addition to existing R&D centers, Apple will soon have R&D centers in Shenzhen, Israel, the U.K., France, Japan and Sweden. Maybe it’s time to rethink Apple’s tagline on all of its products — “designed by Apple in Cupertino and many other countries.”

94,Natasha Lomas,"Samsung is permanently discontinuing production and sales of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, owing to safety fears over defective batteries — including in replacement handsets the company had subsequently sent to customers following a recall of original devices.
The news was reported earlier by the WSJ, and a spokeswomen for Samsung confirmed it is ending production of the device, telling TechCrunch: “We can confirm the report that Samsung has permanently discontinued the production of Galaxy Note7.”
The company did not provide any additional statement explaining its decision but in a filing about ending production with South Korean regulators it cites ‘customer safety’ as the reason.
Yesterday Samsung had asked carriers and resellers to halt sales and exchanges of Note 7 devices, as reports of problems with replacement handsets mounted. Note 7 owners were offered a full refund or a refund for a different Samsung smartphone, along with a $25 gift certificate or other add-on to sweeten the hassle of dealing with two rounds of recalls.
The initial recall of the circa 2.5 million Note 7s in circulation was announced in early September.
The company had also previously said it was adjusting production of the Note 7 to, in its words, “take further steps to ensure quality and safety matters”.
However, in the event, and given the mounting PR nightmare of even replacement Note 7s having a demonstrable risk of an exploding battery — coupled with the model being namechecked as a safety hazard at airports and on flights all over the world — it’s hardly a surprise Samsung has decided to pull the plug and put the Note 7 out of its misery.
Aside from the damage to Samsung’s Galaxy brand of being associated with exploding batteries, the cost of withdrawing the Note 7 will not come cheap. Reuters cites analysts estimating that a permanent end to Note 7 sales could cost the company up to $17 billion.
Meanwhile, the company’s stock price has also taken a substantial hit on the news of the Note 7’s nixing: falling by 8 per cent today, its biggest percentage decline since October 2008, as investors wiped some $19 billion off the value of the company.
Update: Samsung has now provided the following statement to TechCrunch:",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/p8112360.jpg?w=738,"samsung-electronics,phablets,samsung-galaxy-note-7",Samsung kills the Galaxy Note 7 for good
95,Jon Russell,"Oh you thought location-based food deal services were done and dusted! Eatigo, a discount restaurant booking service that bills itself as the anti-Groupon, would have you believe otherwise. The startup has closed new funding to the tune of over $10 million from travel giant TripAdvisor to expand its service across Southeast Asia.
Eatigo was founded in 2013 and it is currently present in Bangkok and Pattaya in Thailand and also in Singapore. It believes it is different to Groupon because it grants restaurant owners full control of when they wish to make offers available to prospective customers. In other words, if I know my restaurant is busy during lunch but quiet from 3pm, Eatigo can arrange offers of up to 50 percent that are valid from 3pm to help make my off-peak times busier.
Not only does that mean additional revenue by utilizing otherwise unused inventory, but it avoids the stampede of people rushing in with discount codes and coupons and flooding an eatery to the point that the staff can’t keep up, which doesn’t give a diner a good experience. That was the case at times when Groupon and LivingSocial were booming a couple of years ago. Discounts can also be varied across time periods, to help manage the number of customers incoming.
Bangkok-headquartered Eatigo said it is seeing 20 percent month-on-month growth for reservations and revenue, but it declined to provide further details of its profit/loss. It claims 700 restaurant partners and one diner seated every three seconds of the day on average.
What’s particularly interesting about this news is that the round — which is Eatigo’s Series B — comes from TripAdvisor. The exact size of the deal has not been disclosed, however Eatigo said that it takes its total funding to date to $15.5 million. TechCrunch understands from sources close to the deal that Eatigo had previously raised less than $5 million from its undisclosed Series A last year and other prior fundraising. That makes this round over $10 million in size.
That Series A was led by corporate investors rather than VC firms. Eatigo CEO Michael Cluzel told TechCrunch that is particularly keen on leveraging such partners because they bring more to the table than simply cash.
One of its Series A investors has links to media — which enabled Eatigo to get affordable billboard advertising across Bangkok, surprising for an early-stage company — and this time around Cluzel said TripAdvisor has much advice to impart from The Fork, its restaurant booking platform in Europe
“We prefer “slow” over “fast” money and having partners on our board who really understand the business and share our vision. The TripAdvisor team from The Fork have gone through the same scaling exercise we are about to embark on,” he said.
“We also have traditionally been seeking out investors who can bring more to the table than money and the opportunities with TripAdvisor are massive in this respect,” the Eatigo CEO added. “From sharing of best practices, over content, creating new revenue streams, technology support and many more we believe that such synergies can improve both user experience as well business performance.”
From TripAdvisor’s side, Bertrand Jelensperger — co-founder and CEO of The Fork — said: “We share with Eatigo a common vision [and] have also been impressed by this fast moving innovative business and by their ambition to quickly grow and scale the brand into other markets across Southeast Asia.”
Cluzel said that Eatigo plans to invest the money on regional growth. He declined to state an exact timeframe for that expansion plan but it is likely to be done in 2017.
“Our focus is clearly on Southeast Asia only for this round. We want to become a truly regional player [and] expect that full rollout across all new markets will take less than one year,” he said.
That regional expansion is aimed at taking the company to breakeven within the next two years, Cluzel added.",2016-10-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/eatigo-screenshots.png?w=738,"restaurant,tripadvisor,southeast-asia",Southeast Asia’s Eatigo lands $10M+ from TripAdvisor for its discount restaurant service
96,Jon Russell,"500 Startups‘ organization in Southeast Asia — 500 Durians — is back with a new $50 million fund to press on with early-stage startup dealmaking in the emerging region, which counts over 600 million consumers.
Although it typically sits in the shadow of India and China, Southeast Asia is poised to see major tech growth. A recent report co-authored by Google predicted that Southeast Asia’s digital economy will reach $200 billion by 2025. With 260 million users now and an estimated 480 million by 2020, it is the world’s fastest growing internet market — bringing 3.8 million people online for the first time each month.
The original 500 Durians fund launched in 2013 to explore those possibilities. Originally it was $10 million, but it was subsequently increased to over $20 million in size and it counts Uber rival Grab, social commerce app Carousell and Indonesia’s Bukalapak among its portfolio. Now 500 Startups, which is led by Khailee Ng in Southeast Asia, is doubling down with a target of $50 million for the second Durians fund.
A first close is expected to come over the next month or two, with a final close likely next year. Ng, who is working with co-partner Vishal Harnal on the fund and backed by a team of eight, said 500 Durians II was “kickstarted” and supported by investors in the original, first fund. Malaysia’s MAVCAP is among the LPs, with others coming from China, Korea, the Middle East and Singapore among other places, Ng said.
While a number of funds in the region that started out at seed stage have matured into Series A, and potentially beyond, Ng told TechCrunch that Durians will maintain an early-stage focus, albeit with more cash.
“What we’ve done works and we don’t want to get greedy about it,” he said in an interview. “Pre-Series A, Series A and Series B is where all the new money is coming in, no-one is really charging into seed stage and those guys will need a pipeline of new deals. We’ll continue to feed the ecosystem.”
“Raising a fund is easier now because we’ve got a track record and people are excited,” Ng added. “Our first 20 deals have matured well, and the next 20 are following a similar pattern.”
Ng said the fund will be used to cut checks that are typically up to $100,000 as part of seed rounds with other investors, although it could creep up to $250,000 “if we see great stuff.” The aim is to fund 100-200 deals and use the remaining funds for follow-on deals.
“We will be pretty cautious with follow-ons,” Ng clarified. “We’ll do them, but larger than before.”
It’s hard to remember a time when 500 Startups wasn’t a prolific investor in Southeast Asia. It has invested in 119 startups in the region to date which, according to CB Insights, means it has been involved in one-quarter of all seed-stage deals in Southeast Asia.
That’s a staggering statistic, even if some deals go unreported and skew the numbers, and Ng said that one of his goals is to go beyond the “startup echo chamber” and reach entrepreneurs who are less familiar with venture capital but are already busy building companies that could benefit from it.
More generally, Ng said his sights are set on business models that are proven overseas but yet to enter the region. He’s also bullish on enterprise — and in particular systems that tap into adoption of mobile, messaging, etc — and see Saas business models developing in sophistication, too.
500 Startups has $10 million micro-funds in Thailand and Vietnam, and Ng said that there is some interest in arranging a similar setup in Philippines. The Durians fund will mainly look at other markets in Southeast Asia — principally Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, and Singapore — but may overlap co-invest with local funds in certain deals.
Generally, the organization has backed over 1,500 startups worldwide, and it has funds in countries like Mexico, India, the Nordics and more. The firm’s global fund closed with $85 million in commitments last year, its LPs include Yahoo Japan, Tokyo-based Dentsu and MAVCAP.",2016-10-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/durians-are-yuck.jpg?w=738,"khailee-ng,southeast-asia,500-durians",500 Startups announces new $50 million fund for Southeast Asia
97,Jon Russell,"Grana, a two-year-old online fashion retailer based in Hong Kong, has announced that it has raised $10 million in fresh funding led by Alibaba’s entrepreneurship fund.
This is the startup’s Series A round, and it follows $6 million in previous seed funding. The round is led by Alibaba’s Hong Kong-based fund, which was announced last year, and it also includes participation from existing investors Golden Gate Ventures (Singapore) and MindWorks Ventures (Hong Kong).
In an interview with TechCrunch, co-founder and CEO Luke Grana said that the new funding will be put to work expanding his company’s selection of products — all of which are own-brand — and growing its reach beyond the 12 countries that Grana currently ships to. In particular, Grana is focused on expanding its business in the U.S., which is already its largest market alongside Hong Kong, just ahead of Australia and Singapore.
Grana isn’t providing specific business figures at this point, other than to say that it is growing at an average of 15 percent month-on-month. Return rates are single-digital percent, with a flat fee — US$10, SG$10 or HK$20 — charged for a collection direct from the customer.
“We’ve experienced really strong growth [and had a] good couple of years that we need to continue,” Grana, who was born and raised in Sydney, Australia, said.
Grana sells its own-brand fashion items exclusively through its website. The company produces its own high-quality fashion products, sourcing its fabric from Italy, Peru, China and other parts of the world. It has an offline store in Hong Kong and has run temporary ‘pop-up’ stores in four countries, so far. Grana just moved into a new 18,000 square foot warehouse in Hong Kong where all product is stored and shipped, while its entire 50 person team is based in Hong Kong. Keeping the business in a single country may seem strange when its customer base is global, but Grana explained it is all about efficiency everyone involved.
“There are no distributors, middle men or warehouses, so we ship direct to the customer. We cut out all the inefficiencies that we can [so that] customers get a really great product at a quality that they’ve never seen before,” he said.
When it comes to business, Grana explained that Hong Kong’s status as the world’s largest air cargo hub, and DHL’s shipping rates, mean that its next-day/two-day delivery service to the U.S. and other countries are on par with any local service. That’s based on both speed for the customer and price for Grana. For that reason, Grana hasn’t opened warehouses in the U.S. or other places to store product locally.
In terms of passing on costs to the customer, Grana said most fashion items carry a mark-up of around seven-to-eight times the cost due to the chain of process. But by stripping out the aforementioned middlemen and fees, Grana — he said — sells at just 2-3X mark-up.
“We travel the world to find the best fabric to make modern wardrobe essentials: great quality items that a large market can wear,” Grana added. “We want to replicate ASOS but using our own brand.”
There’s no plan to introduce its items via offline retailers, nor will Grana become a sales front for other like-minded, independent fashion brands. The goal is to continue on as is, but grow its reach and scope.
Global expansion is on the agenda for 2017, but CEO Luke Grana isn’t being too specific on exactly which countries will be targeted. China is one confirmed name on the list with a soft launch likely to happen “sometime next year.” For that move, Grana is likely to shift its distribution model somewhat and align itself with existing e-commerce portals to gain reach. Grana hinted that Alibaba’s Taobao marketplace could be an ideal entrance point, and he said his company is working closely with the e-commerce giant to weigh up its method of entry into China.
“There’s a really good fit with Alibaba, strategically we are leaning a lot about e-commerce in China and getting logistics and infrastructure support,” he said.
On the product side, Grana’s range spans 10 fabrics, 90 styles and 3,000 SKUs across shorts, sweaters, swimwear and underwear in both men’s and women’s fashion. Grana said the company plans to expand to sportswear, bags and accessories early next year, while he’d like to also begin producing and selling items like shoes in the longer term.",2016-10-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/luke-grana-and-tfr_2.jpg?w=738,"golden-gate-ventures,hong-kong,grana",Online fashion retailer Grana raises $10M led by Alibaba’s entrepreneurship fund
98,Ingrid Lunden,"Stripe, the company that lets app publishers, online merchants and other digital businesses include payments features via a few lines of code, is expanding in Asia. After launching in Singapore two weeks ago, the startup is now officially opening for business in Japan. And alongside the Japan launch, Stripe is announcing a new investor. Sumitomo Mitsui Card Company, the largest credit card provider in the country, is taking a stake in the startup.
Sumitomo Mitsui and Stripe are not disclosing the amount that is getting invested, but it is strategic: the companies have been partnering since Stripe launched a beta of its service in Japan, in May 2015.
Sumitomo Mitsui, which was also the first partner for Visa in Japan (Visa is also a Stripe backer), is also working with Stripe on the full, official rollout. It’s helping specifically in areas like multi-currency acceptance: merchants and other businesses in Japan can use Stripe to sell goods in some 130 different currencies — a big advance on current offerings that are restricted to yen.
(Doing some simple math, I’m guessing that Sumitomo Mitsui’s investment is at least $10 million and a follow on from its previous round: Crunchbase lists $290 million in funding for Stripe, while Stripe itself, in the news release it sent out around the funding and launch, notes that it has raised “around $300 million” at a valuation of $5 billion, the same valuation it had around its last funding round in July 2015.)
The lengthy beta period meant that Stripe picked up a number of customers before its official launch today: they include All Nippon Airways, e-commerce platform BUYMA, event app Peatix, and SmartHR. Globally, Stripe says it has around 100,000 customers, including large marketplace startups like GoFundMe, on-demand, mobile-first businesses like Lyft and Instacart, and many more.
Stripe takes a 3.6% commission on each approved card charge in Japan, similar to its basic rate in other countries; using its API is free.
Adding Japan brings the total number of countries where Stripe is live to 25 — and just a day after Japan, Stripe added Spain, for a total of 26 countries. While Stripe is now on something of a roll internationally, adding Japan is a notable launch for a couple of reasons. For one, it’s a big market for Stripe to tackle: Japan is the second-largest economy in Asia (after China) in terms of GDP and one of the biggest globally.
There are a number of other payment providers in the market — they include Rakuten (which also invests in one of Stripe’s competitors, WePay) and PayPal, among others. But Stripe said that its multi-currency feature — its API will let businesses sell to customers in 130 different currencies, not just yen — is a first for merchants and other businesses in the country.
In the past, Japanese companies would have had to set up separate bank accounts and business entities to process non-yen currencies, in part because “Japan’s financial infrastructure was built independently from the rest of the world and some of the mechanics have made it challenging for Japanese businesses to expand globally,” in the words of Daniel Heffernan, who heads up Stripe’s business in Japan.
“Japan has been a powerhouse in technology for decades, but bridging to the rest of the world economy is an achievement only a small percentage of companies have accomplished,” Patrick Collison, co-founder and CEO of Stripe, said in a statement. “Stripe aims to empower more Japanese companies to export their creativity and ambition to the rest of the world.”
The new service in Japan will also include fraud protection and other security features; and as with other markets, Stripe will also build a larger financial services ecosystem around its basic payments service to improve its margins.
Those other services include accounting, billing, security, and PCI compliance, as well as access to third-party technologies like Apple Pay and Android Pay. (Some features — like Instant Payouts, which was launched last month — are still not available outside the U.S.)
Considering that Stripe has had an office in Japan since June 2014, I asked Heffernan why it took so long to launch there.
“Rather than launching a one-size-fits-all product everywhere, we think about each new market from first principles, taking our time to get to know the nuances and understand the unique needs and pain points of local businesses,” he said. “This helps us address the most pressing needs of developers and offer the best possible product for a particular market.”
It also sounds like it took some time to work out how to handle more than one currency.
“We built this feature from scratch for the Japanese market, which involved a considerable amount of time and work to make it available today,” Heffernan said. “Multicurrency has never before been available in Japan, and we wanted to make that happen.”
Sumitomo Mitsui’s investment is interesting because it comes on the heels of reports that the financial services company was looking to invest in rising fintech startups (in other words, there may be more to come).
The context here is that there weren’t many fintech investments in the country immediately prior to 2016, in part because of regulation, and in part because of cautious strategies around new financial models in the wake of disasters like the Mt Gox bitcoin exchange, which was based out of Tokyo.
To some extent, even the Stripe investment went through some reality checks: “We looked at the most sophisticated global technology companies — Facebook, Twitter, Kickstarter — and they all use Stripe to process payments,” says Hideo Shimada, Chairman of Sumitomo Mitsui Card Corporation, in a statement. “Stripe is bringing a new standard of financial and technological infrastructure to Japanese businesses and we are happy to support them.”
As for what’s next, Stripe is currently still in beta in Hong Kong, and Heffernan said the company is seeing a lot of interest in Southeast Asia from users (based in countries it currently supports), and it is “in the very early stages” of exploring the market there. “Asia will continue to be a primary focus for Stripe over the next few months,” he said.
Other investors in Stripe include Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Visa, American Express, Peter Thiel, Max Levchin, and Elon Musk.",2016-10-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/japan-flag.jpg?w=738,"japan,payments,stripe","Stripe payments exits beta in Japan, adds Sumitomo Mitsui Card Company as investor"
99,Natasha Lomas,"Facebook is seeking to fill in some of the gaps in the reach of its messaging app empire, announcing today a new standalone version of its Messenger app, Messenger Lite, specifically designed for older Android devices with limited storage and for slower, data-constrained Internet connections.
Idea being that not everyone in the world has the premium hardware and superfast data connectivity that its full-fat messaging product assumes.
“With Messenger Lite, people are able to quickly and easily send text, photos and links to anyone using Messenger or Messenger Lite,” writes Facebook introducing the new app.
Or of course they could just use SMS.
The move follows Facebook launching a stripped down version of its main Android app for users in emerging markets last year. That app, called Facebook Lite, eschews data-intensive content like video and location-powered features like Nearby Friends to offer a more basic feature set and low res imagery in an app that’s less than 1MB in size.
Earlier this year Facebook revealed usage of this no-frills Facebook app had ballooned to 100 million monthly actives just nine months after launch, confirming it as its fastest growing app at that point — a growth trick it’s clearly hoping to repeat now with Messenger Lite.
Albeit Messenger Lite is not so modest in size: Facebook says the new stripped down Messenger is around 10MB. Although Android hardware continues to improve, even at the affordability focused end of the pipe. 
In terms of features, Messenger Lite supports what Facebook dubs “core experiences” — namely: “messaging, sending and receiving photos and links, and receiving stickers”. Yes, stickers aren’t a nice-to-have in the hyper competitive world of mobile messaging. 
Facebook says Messenger Lite for Android is starting to roll out, initially to Kenya, Tunisia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Venezuela — with other countries slated to be added in the “coming months”.
Last year rival messaging app Line also launched a stripped down Android app aiming to win users in a swathe of emerging markets, called Line Lite. So if Facebook doesn’t grab these users, another messaging player surely will.
Facebook has also previously launched Facebook Zero, a text-only version of its website that was subsidized by carriers — another on-boarding strategy for users in emerging markets.
But one of its most aggressive strategies for growing usage of its mobile messaging empire, and thus also getting its hands on users’ phone numbers, is shuttering access to messages within its mobile app — thereby forcing users to download Messenger if they wish to continue their conversations. (It’s even been excising messages from the mobile web version of its website.)
This user-hostile strategy has nonetheless inflated Messenger usage. But then if you force people to download an app in order to read messages from friends you are doing the equivalent of twisting their arm behind their back.
We’ve asked Facebook whether it will be removing access to messages from its web app for users in the markets where it’s launching the new Messenger Lite for Android and will update this post with any response. It seems prudent to expect this to happen though, assuming it hasn’t already done so… Update: Facebook declined to provide an on-the-record statement about this.
Facebook’s aggression with Messenger looks especially gratuitous when you consider it also owns mobile messaging giant WhatsApp. So it has not one but two 1BN+ mobile messaging platforms under its control and command.
But hey, if you’re in the user data-mining ad profiling business then sucking up as much personal data as possible is the name of the game.
Also not surprising: Facebook-owned WhatsApp recently announced it would start sharing user data with its parent company for ad targeting purposes, in a bid to triangulate yet more information on users of the two services.
So you could say: resistance is futile. Although of course other messaging apps and platforms are available.",2016-10-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-03-at-9-08-08-am.png?w=721,"messenger,facebook-messenger",Facebook launches pared back Android chat app to keep growing its messaging empire
100,Jon Russell,"Chat app company Line is investing in international opportunities after it announced that it is backing two VC firms outside of its home-turf in Asia: DAG Ventures in the U.S. and France-based Korelya Capital.
Line, which went public in a billion-dollar dual U.S.-Japan IPO this summer, didn’t disclose its investment into DAG Ventures, but it did say that together with parent company Naver it will put €100 million ($112 million) equally into Korelya Capital’s new K-Fund 1.
In an announcement, the company said these investments are designed to pave the way for it to move beyond its focus on Asia and grow its current 218 million monthly active user base, three-quarters of whom reside in four countries:
Palo Alto-based DAG Ventures is a mid-stage firm that includes Wix, Admob, Cloudera, and GrubHub among its portfolio. Korelya Capital, on the other hand, is a new fund started by former French Minister of Culture and Communications Fleur Pellerin.
This isn’t the first time that Line and Naver have invested in a VC fund. Naver is an LP in Golden Gate Ventures’ latest $60 million fund for Southeast Asia, which is also a strategic move to unlock business opportunities in the region.
This deal with VC firms comes the same day that Line announced a $45 million investment in Snow, a Snapchat clone created by Naver which gained attention in China, Korea, Japan and other parts of Asia.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/c4798c22ce4c4bcabcb283e08e57fe84.jpg?w=738,"investment,naver,line",Chat app Line backs VC funds to unlock global growth opportunities
101,Jon Russell,"Line, the messaging company that went public in the year’s highest IPO to date, is diversifying its business and focusing on social after it invested $45 million (50 billion KRW) in Snow, a Snapchat clone focused on Asia.
The deal sees Line take 25 percent equity in Snow, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. Snow made headlines this summer for racking up downloads in Japan, Korea, China and Southeast Asia with a product that looks very much like Snapchat. This investment is not quite as surprising as it might first seem, since Line’s parent company Naver is the parent company of Snow, too. Essentially, the two are cousins, albeit that Line is very much the older family member.
Snow features more than 30 different filters and over 700 stickers, making it like Snapchat on steroids — arguably with a cleaner interface. Neither the company nor Line has said how many downloads Snow has received. The New York Times speculated that it had crossed 30 million in June, and the app has taken the top download spot in Japan, Korea, China and other markets.
Line’s core messaging app service has emerged as one of the most popular services in many parts of Asia, but there are some question marks around its future. The app counts 218 million monthly active users, two-thirds of which are in Japan, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia, but it only added 13 million to that figure over the last year. That’s around six percent growth, and it goes some way to explain this investment.
Line isn’t solely focused on messaging. It also offers a number of connected games and apps that tap into the Line messenger friend graph, as well as photo apps B612, Egg and Line Camera. The company has managed to diversify its revenue, too. It grossed $1 billion in sales in 2015, which included revenue from official accounts for companies, in-app purchases within its games and stickers. Sales of stickers amounted to an impressive $270 million in sales last year.
Previous investments from Line include games studio 4:33, while it has a fund for apps that work with its chat app, and it has put money into at least nine U.S. startups.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/line-nyse-2.jpg?w=738,"messaging,naver,snow,line",Line invests $45 million into Snapchat clone Snow
102,Jon Russell,"Singapore-based Greyloft has raised $1.1 million to build out its vision of what a real estate agency should look and function like in today’s digital era.
Wait! Estate agents? Aren’t they the bad actors that spoil things for everyone?
It’s true that many startups attacking the real estate have chosen to disintermediate agents on the premise that their motivations are misaligned with those of the consumers they represent. At their worst, their goal is often to maximize their take-home of a deal, rather than satisfying their client 100 percent. India’s NoBroker, which raised $10 million earlier this year, is probably the best example of that ‘direct-to-consumer’ model.
Greyloft believes that it can solve the problem by bringing agents under its own roof and this seed stage financing, which was provided DSG Consumer Partners, Wavemaker, Cub Capital, Tigris Capital and JFDI, will help it build on its early promise.
The startup was founded last year by ex-bankers Siddhesh Narayanan (CEO) and Archit Agarwal (CTO), who explained the vision as more of a ‘real estate 2.0’ than online property portal. In its system, it works with a selection of closely affiliate licensed agents who are incentivized to put the customer first, changing a dynamic that many believe is broken.

Left to right: Greyloft founders Archit Agarwal and Siddhesh Narayanan
Greyloft focuses on two pieces for its business: giving consumers — buyers and sellers — a platform for home rentals and sales, on the other side it generates leads and business for real estate agents.
“We are doing every single thing an estate agency does, but much smarter,” Narayanan said in an interview.
The company aims to attract agents by offering a CRM system that does some obvious things that real estate professionals don’t currently get access to using their existing setups, which are predominantly offline and analog. That includes software that manages multiple deals, transitions clients between colleagues, keeps track of paperwork, and can track client requests, meaning that agencies can take requests months in advanced.
“Once they get used to the backend systems… it allows them to focus on customer service not being a push salesperson as agents are sometimes known for,” Agarwal said.
Narayanan admitted that it is challenging finding the right brokers in Singapore since there is a small pool who are licensed, and Greyloft’s own approach takes some explaining. But, all things considered, the startup’s founders see the right kind of agents as essential to the process.
“Buying property is one of the biggest decisions you’ll make in your life, and rent is also one of the biggest items [of expenditure] out there. You need an expert to advise you,” Narayanan argued.
With its new funding secured, the company is aiming to “step on the pedal a little and get more customers to know us.” That will involve the creation of a dedicated sales team in Singapore and potentially exploring possible overseas expansion plans. Right now, Greyloft outsources its technology in India while it has a customer services team that is based in the Philippines.
Singapore is no easy market to win, however. More establish rivals include iProperty, which was bought by News Corp for over $500 million, PropertyGuru, which raised $129 million in its most recent funding in 2015, while there is also 99.co, a startup backed by more than $1.6 million from investors like Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin.",2016-09-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/condo-browsing.jpg?w=738,"real-estate,property,singapore",Singapore’s Greyloft lands $1.1M to build a real estate agency for the digital era
103,Jon Russell,"Afters years of waiting, Spotify has finally launched its music streaming service in Japan. We reported earlier this month that the launch would happen before September is out, and the company just about delivered on that timeframe.
Spotify has had an office in Tokyo for at last 18 months, but protracted negotiations with record labels and the music industry have seen competitors like Apple, Line and Rakuten sneak in first with rival services. Now Spotify has joined its ranks with its free service and the paid-for option which costs 980 yen ($9.60) a month.
Japan is a hugely lucrative market for music. Sales are estimated at nearly $3 billion per year which makes it the world’s second largest market behind only the U.S., but Japanese consumers prefer to buy their musical physically, in the form of CDs, than digitally right now. Streaming service providers are viewing that as an opportunity rather than a threat, and success in Japan could give Spotify some momentum headed into 2017 when it is expected that the firm will make efforts to go public.
Spotify recently passed 40 million paying customers, and it’ll be aiming to add a large chunk more to that number from Japan.
It its favor, it is the one mainstream streaming service in Japan that has a free-tier option for users. That goes some way to explaining why it has taken so long for the Swedish company to secure deals with record labels, but it could be a factor that helps its service gain some momentum in the country among users who are not used to paying for digital music consumption.
This launch represents Spotify’s second major expansion in Asia this year. Back in March, it entered Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, ending a quiet spell in the continent. Spotify first entered Asia in 2013 with launches in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, but, prior to 2016, it had only expanded to one new market since then: the Philippines.
We’ve heard whispers from inside Spotify that India is its next market of focus for Asia, although we understand that the company is studying the market and doesn’t have concrete plans for a launch right now. It might do well to observe Google’s efforts after the search giant launched its Google Play Music service in the South Asian country this week.",2016-09-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/shutterstock_226042204.jpg?w=738,"music-streaming,streaming,japan","Spotify finally launches in Japan, the world’s second largest music market"
104,Jon Russell,"Didi Chuxing, China’s largest ride-hailing company, has hired two distinguished security experts to lead a new U.S.-based research center as part of a major push to increase its data security efforts.
Dr Fengmin Gong, whose 30 year work history includes starting Palo Alto networks, and Zheng Bu, who worked with Gong at FireEye and spent time with McAfee among employers, have taken key positions at the company, Didi announced today.
Gong becomes Didi’s VP of information security strategy and vice president of the company’s new U.S.-based Didi Research Institute. Bu will be based in China where he’ll work directly with Gong as Didi’s VP of information security operations. In that role, he’ll manage the company’s existing information security team in China.
Didi, which is in the process of acquiring Uber’s business in China, formally unveiled a China-based center in December 2015, but little is known about its U.S.-based branch. The company isn’t saying a great deal at this point.
A spokesperson said the center will be “a unit that helps to enable business inside rather than just focus on security” while Gong himself explained that he and Bu will “take responsibility for overall security” within the company.
“We have detailed plans we are working on,” Gong told TechCrunch. “Clearly Silicon Valley is best place to attract many talents [and a] much better vantage point to see the demands and needs across the globe.”
Gong has spent most of his life working in enterprise security environments, but he said that he and Bu were attracted to Didi principally because of the scale of the company’s business. Didi said this summer that it has over 14 million drivers and 300 million active users with 10 million rides completed on its service each day.
“The Didi platform and service it provides and number of people and partners in touches, presents probably the most sophisticated customer use case,” Gong explained. “[Bu and I] have been working in security for traditional enterprise, [this is the first opportunity] that represents a good blend of enterprise and new-age internet-based sharing economy. Plus we were very impressed by Didi’s ambition and ability to execute.”
Didi has an alliance with fellow Uber rivals Lyft in the U.S., Ola in India and Grab in Southeast Asia which includes a roaming deal for its users across different services and an exchange of information and best practices. While Didi’s deal with Uber has cast considerable doubt on the strength of that union, Gong said that he is “expecting” to engage in dialogue with those three companies as he settles into his new role.
Interestingly, driver and passenger fraud is one area that Gong said will fall under his reach. Beyond simply safeguarding the data and passengers and drivers — such as driving licenses and sensitive travel information — from outside threats and operational data security management, the new push will aim to cut down the massive problem of ride fraud.
With vast subsidies on offer for drivers and passengers, the Chinese internet is awash with offers to spoof rides and split the proceeds between fake rider and fake driver. This is an issue that has dogged both Didi and Uber China. Uber said last year that fraud accounts for 10 percent of all bookings in China, but experts have estimated the problem to be multiples higher. It isn’t clear how widely fraud impacts Didi’s business today after it raised prices and cut some subsidies following the Uber China deal, but Gong and his team will certainly “enable” business at Didi if they are able to stamp out even a fraction of fake rides.",2016-09-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/didi-2.jpg?w=738,"infosec,security",Didi Chuxing makes information security push with new U.S. research lab and hires
105,Jon Russell,"If you travel a lot, or even just a little, you’ll be sick of roaming bills, or frustrated by the inconvenience of the cheaper alternative: buying a local SIM and switching it with your regular one. Hong Kong-based Tink Labs believes it has a better solution, a designated mobile device in your hotel room that you can use for free, and it has raised a whopping $125 million to expand its idea to cover more hotels worldwide.
The new financing was providing by existing investor and manufacturing giant Foxconn (via its FIH Mobile unit), with participation from Sinovation Ventures, the investment firm from ex-Google China head Kaifu Lee, and Cai Wensheng, a prolific angel investor who is Chairman of popular Chinese photo service Meitu.
Tink Labs CEO 24-year-old Terence Kwok declined to provide the company’s valuation, but hinted that it is above $500 million.
“We’re not a unicorn yet, but are more than halfway there,” he said.
That would make it the highest-valued tech startup in Hong Kong, and certainly one of the most notable in Asia, yet Kwok is happy to remain discreet and focused on business.
“We’ve kept a low profile even though there’s a consumer element to the product,” he said.
Tink Labs began as a device rental service that targeted travelers at airports, but Kwok said it pivoted when the team found that the business wasn’t as scalable as hoped.
“We quickly released people just want to get the hell out of the airport,” he said.
It remained focused on travelers, but moved its touch point to hotels where it has founded traction, raising over $170 million from investors to date, today’s announcement included, and working with major groups like Starwood, Accor, Shangri-la, and Melia.
Tink Labs’ flagship product is Handy, a smartphone for hotel guests that takes the pain out of mobile roaming. You can make calls and send messages like a normal phone, but it also includes details of services available at your hotel and nearby activities. It even hooks into the hotel’s telephone system so you can order room service before you get back to your room, call a colleague via their room number, or phone the helpdesk if you’re out and about but need help talking to a taxi driver in the local language.
It’s a neat two-way model: guests get a device and free services, while hotels get a powerful channel through which they can engage their guests.

All of this comes for free because hotels are sold on the idea that Handy can increase their engagement with guests, which translates to higher spending.
A hotelier’s dream is a guest who not only stays in their rooms regularly, but uses facilitates and services like the on-site spa, steak house or minibar. That’s the kind of guest who generates serious revenue.
Four-year-old Handy believes it can deliver on that mission.
It touts a two-year independent study which, it said, found that guests would spend an additional $21 per night on average when staying in a room that includes a Handy device.
Kwok told TechCrunch in an interview that typically 30 percent of guests who stay in a room with a Handy will engage with hotel information via the device. Compare that to your own experience — when was the last time you opened that gigantic book of hotel services?
The Tink Labs CEO reckons that less than 10 percent of guests go down the traditional route and open the book of services. That severely limits additional revenue than a hotel can make. Tink Labs charges hotels an undisclosed subscription fee — “it’s certainly nowhere near $21,” Kwok said — which can help them increase their revenue. That fee varies based on the requests of a hotel, though its important to note that hotels are forbidden from charging guests to use a Handy.
Tink Labs works with Foxconn to produce its devices, but it is changing things up with plans to introduce phones next year that it has designed itself. Right now its devices are fairly standard although they run on a “modified version of Android that is heavily, heavily customized,” Kwok said. He’s ready to takes things further and from April next year the company will give hotels bespoke devices under its own brand that can do things like control the TV set in a hotel room, and more.
Beyond developing specialist hardware, Kwok said he intends to triple the current team of 150 people and expand its reach of seven international offices to go after more hotel partners across the world.
Right now, the Handy service is in over 100 hotels with nearly one million people using Handy devices each month, the company said. It started off focused on Asia, and Kwok said Handy is present is half of the hotels in Singapore and Hong Kong, while its reach in London is at nearly 25 percent. The goal is now to expand that presence into other tourist and traveler spots and beyond.

106,Steve O'Hear,"Headed up by Kaidi Ruusalepp, who was previously CEO of the Nasdaq Tallinn stock exchange, Estonia’s Funderbeam is on a mission to build what she calls a “funding and trading engine for growth companies”.
Providing tools to research, fund and trade in private companies, the bigger vision is to build something akin to a “stock exchange” for startups based on blockchain technology. To make that vision a reality, Funderbeam has raised $2.6 million in further funding.
Leaning the round is Draper Associates, Thomson Reuters, and IQ Capital, with participation from an array of previous Funderbeam backers, such as 3TS Capital Partners. Notable other investors include Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, and David Braben, the CEO and Founder of Frontier Developments.
“There’s too much complexity in the pre-IPO/private market. Companies used to go to exchanges for growth financing, but looking at the startup funding trends, like Uber raising €3.5 billion in just one round, plus the cost structure of getting listed and being listed, it does not make sense anymore,” Ruusalepp tells me.
“Today growth companies look to the stock markets only as a serious option for exits. On top, early-stage and growth funding has grown to unimagined heights, but it is one of the most illiquid assets classes. Once you’re in, you hardly get out”.
This of course is where Funderbeam comes in. The platform is part research tool — the first part of the problem the startup set out to solve when it launched in 2013 — and part investment platform, providing a way for startups to raise funding and for investors to invest in burgeoning and potentially high growth companies.
But to truly solve the liquidity problem, there needs to be a transparent and trustworthy platform for secondary trading, and one that can work across borders. And this is where Funderbeam’s nascent trading feature comes into play. It lets shareholders sell their stake in a startup, either one that was originally funded via the platform or potentially any that they have permission to trade.
“Using blockchain technology we aim to show the stock markets how technology can turn the sector around. For the first time ever, early stage investors can choose both how much to invest, and how long to keep the investment,” explains Ruusalepp. “Or to put it in a fruitier way,” she says, “imagine if Bloomberg, Angellist and Nasdaq had a baby”.
Blockchain technology, argues Ruusalepp, provides the transparency needed to help address trust issues inherent with any trading system and that digital technology trumps paper records that still hamper stock exchanges and databases of company ownership.
“There is a coming shift in trust [that is seeing] customers start trusting technology instead of people and institutions,” she says. “As the internet is for exchanging data and information, blockchain is being placed one level higher – it is used to exchange values. It’s like a global public notary registering and keeping an eye on all global transactions on assets”.
That “fundamental vision and usage opportunity” for blockchain is something Funderbeam and its investors are embracing. “We decided to test it, to be the first one who has built a securities trading platform on the blockchain,” adds Ruusalepp.",2016-10-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/funderbeam-team-1-of-1-1.jpg?w=738,,Estonia’s Funderbeam is building a blockchain-based “stock exchange” for startups
107,Lora Kolodny,"Noodle Partners Inc., a new education venture from the founder of The Princeton Review and 2U Inc., John Katzman, has raised $4 million in venture funding to help colleges and universities deliver high-quality certificate and degree programs online.
Philadelphia-based Osage Venture Partners led the investment in Noodle Partners and was joined by New Markets Venture Partners, 500 Startups and others.
Katzman tells TechCrunch that the challenge in delivering online education at the college and university level has changed dramatically over the last decade, and not just because of the rise of smartphones.
“People did not believe that higher ed could be as good online as a campus-based program. That’s because the first wave was full of for-profits that were just not very good schools. Today, there are many great schools online and we know the problem is not the medium. The new challenge is building and offering programs that are great, but also lower the cost of higher education,” Katzman said in 2008, when he co-founded 2U Inc. with Chip Paucek and Jeremy Johnson.
Trump University, and the University of Phoenix (owned by Apollo Education) are two famous examples of unscrupulous, for-profit online schools in that earlier wave. These organizations sold students on useless degrees and costly seminars that would leave them more in debt than anything else.
College enrollment in the U.S. has declined for five straight years, according to the most recent available data from the National Center for Education Statistics. That correlates with a 34% increase in the cost for undergraduate tuition, fees, room, and board at public colleges and universities, and a 25% increase at private non-profit institutions between 2004 and 2014.
Katzman believes that offering more of their degree programs online, and at a higher quality than ever before, will help colleges reverse that trend.
New York-based Noodle Partners offers colleges and universities help setting up an online degree program, instructional design for courses within the program, recruiting, tech support, and measuring student engagement along the way to course completion. The startup charges for setup and a flat fee per student.
Other companies doing this work (called “online program management”) will typically take a large percent of tuition they help schools generate from their online offerings, cutting into the school’s already challenged margins.
Competitors to Noodle Partners include 2U, the company Katzman started but with which he is no longer affiliated, Academic Partnerships, HotChalk, Keypath, Pearson Embanet, Wiley Education Solution and others.
Osage Venture Partners’ Nate Lentz said he backed Noodle Partners believing, “Something needs to change the cost curve in higher ed.”

108,John Biggs,"The promise of 3D printing has been kind of a dud. Aside from a few cool Yoda heads and some small plastic pieces, there have been no “indie” players doing much interesting in the space except Markforged. Markforged is a Boston company we featured last year that makes carbon-fiber reinforced plastic parts using traditional 3D-printing techniques. This means the objects they print are stronger, lighter and more resilient than steel.
Now they’ve added “more precise” to that list. The Markforged Mark X is a unique 3D printer that uses laser scanning to ensure pieces that come off the machine are precisely as ordered. In other words, you can send objects that will get the “the strength and quality you’re expecting,” says founder Greg Mark, an aerospace engineer and MIT grad.
“We invented Continuous fiber reinforcement (10 issued patents), and in-process laser-micrometer quality control,” he said. “We’ve also pushed the surface finish of plastic extrusion to approach the surface finish of SLA. Now there’s one machine that combines the strength, surface finish, and quality control to enable end use parts. Supply chains will never be the same.”
Essentially the system prints very fine, very strong objects and constantly tests them for structural accuracy. When you send an object to the $68,000 printer, it ejects exactly the part you requested with exactly the right measurements.
“The in-process quality control is based off a laser micrometer integrated into the print head. With 1 micron Z axis resolution, and 50 micron X/Y resolution, you get high-resolution scans of your part, which you can pull dimensions off of in real time or use to check the accuracy of the part,” said Mark.
The system has two print heads, one for plastic and one for carbon fiber. You can set the hardness of the object while you manufacture it and, more importantly, you can control how light the object is. I’ve seen many Markforged products and they’re as solid as steel but as light as plastic. They’re surprisingly cool. Thanks to the measurement system you can basically send objects to a printer in your office or a thousand miles away and ensure that the object that comes out is exactly as you designed it and has unrivaled strength. In other words, instead of sending a milled piece of steel you can send and print a digital file.
Current Markforged owners will get a discount on the Mark X but, given this thing is almost $70,000, I doubt many hobbyists will pick one up. It’s still one of the coolest implementations of 3D printing I’ve seen, however, and it’s pretty darn close to teleportation.",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-11-at-3-43-52-pm.png?w=738,"business,technology,office-equipment",The Markforged Mark X lets you teleport precision custom parts from designer to printer
109,Lora Kolodny,"According to a new study published today from the American Civil Liberties Union, major social networks including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have recently provided user data access to Geofeedia, the location-based, social media surveillance system used by government offices, private security firms, marketers and others.
As TechCrunch previously reported, Geofeedia is one of a bevy of technologies used, secretly, by police to monitor activists and the contents of their discussions online.
The ACLU said in a blog post that both Twitter and Facebook (which owns Instagram) made some immediate changes in response to their study’s findings.
“Instagram cut off Geofeedia’s access to public user posts, and Facebook cut its access to a topic-based feed of public user posts,” the ACLU said.
The ACLU also noted in their post:
“Neither Facebook nor Instagram has a public policy specifically prohibiting developers from exploiting user data for surveillance purposes. Twitter does have a ‘longstanding rule’ prohibiting the sale of user data for surveillance as well as a Developer Policy that bans the use of Twitter data ‘to investigate, track or surveil Twitter users.’”
On Tuesday, following the publication of the ACLU findings, Twitter announced that it would “immediately suspend Geofeedia’s commercial access to Twitter data.”
A Facebook spokesperson tells TechCrunch:
“[Geofeedia] only had access to data that people chose to make public. Its access was subject to the limitations in our Platform Policy, which outlines what we expect from developers that receive data using the Facebook Platform. If a developer uses our APIs in a way that has not been authorized, we will take swift action to stop them and we will end our relationship altogether if necessary.”
It’s worth noting that Facebook’s platform policy generically limits developers.
For example, it says developers are not permitted to “sell, license, or purchase any data obtained” from Facebook or its services. And they can’t transfer data they get from Facebook, including “anonymous, aggregate, or derived data,” to any data brokers. Finally, developers are not permitted to put Facebook data into any search engines or directories without the social network’s explicit permission.
We have reached out to Geofeedia for comment but executives were not immediately available for an interview.
A public relations consultant for Geofeedia sent a lengthy statement, attributed to Geofeedia CEO Phil Harris, defending the company’s practices in general. An excerpt follows:

110,Matthew Lynley,"Dropbox is still working its way through the enterprise world in order to show the world it isn’t just dumb online storage — which, given as simple as it was to use, was one of the tool’s original top selling points.
So it’s had to shift gears in order to focus on larger companies, and that means consistently rolling out new tools that companies need as they start to expand. And that also means that Dropbox has to keep pace with the rest of the market. So today, to do that, the company is updating its apps with a few new features that should help it continue to have a toehold within larger companies.
“I think overall our approach is, let’s work well extensively across all platforms,” Matt Pan, group product manager for Dropbox’s File Collaboration Product Group said. “We know workplaces increasingly have a set of heterogeneous tools, not just at a platform level like a bunch of people using Mac and Windows. A lot of people have very mixed environments where some people use Office, whether you’re Adobe users or the long tail. Dropbox making all those things tied together in a really simple way has been very much the key to success in the workplace.”
So, here’s a quick rundown of the things that Dropbox is rolling out today:
The first update is PDF signing, which allows users to open PDF files right from their mobile devices and insert signatures and text into them. It seems simple enough, but this is actually a pretty big pain point for a lot of companies that need to get approval for projects and want to keep the ball rolling quickly.
Another update Dropbox is getting today is an integration with iMessage. When Apple opened up iMessage to third-party developers, it became clear to the company that it would have to address the service’s usage within businesses, which was very common, Pan said. So the company is rolling out more rich file-sharing within iMessage that includes previews and the like for its users.
“For workplace communications in a meaningful way we’re seeing [a lot of iMessage use] with small or medium businesses, especially for medium companies — larger companies might be a little stricter with what kind of tools users use,” Pan said. “Within SMBs, we see iMessage used pretty significantly — especially desktop — and for people who have a primarily mobile workforce, like when you have kind of a big real estate team.”
The company is also rolling out a lock-screen widget that will give users the ability to do the most common actions you might find in a Dropbox app from the lock screen. Tapping on one of the functions will go straight to an operation within Dropbox. While this idea might seem useful, Dropbox is still going to have to deal with the constant uphill battle for real estate on that lock screen to ensure that users aren’t getting a cluttered screen and simply ignoring it.
Later this year, the company is adding split-screen usage on the iPad, so users can have the Dropbox app open while surfing through other services. The strongest use case likely still has to be determined here, but there are some natural ones — like viewing a video while still operating the Dropbox app.
The last one is that Dropbox is enabling a picture-in-picture environment on the iPad that allows users to have a video going while they continue to work, similar in the way to YouTube users having a video playing at the bottom-right corner while they are searching for a new video.
All these additions can at times seem incremental (though some, including a literal document scanner through your phone camera, less so), but they’re all an effort to essentially keep pace with the rest of the tools available in the market. Not only does Dropbox have to contend with Box, which started with enterprise customers in the first place, it has to deal with other services like Google Docs, as well. And it seems clear that Salesforce is looking to increasingly get into collaboration services after buying Quip for $750 million.
The company has around 500 million registered users and 200,000 paying customers, it says. While its previous valuation hit as high as $10 billion, there are certainly going to be questions as to whether the traditionally consumer product will be able to pick up steam in the corporate world. Dropbox is banking — including with this update today — that focusing on simplicity and ease of use will give it an edge over those other competitors.

111,Anthony Ha,"Remote Year should be a pretty appealing idea to anyone with a serious case of wanderlust: Participants spend a whole year working abroad, moving to a different city and country each month.
But is it just a fun, one-time experiment, or the seed of a big business? The team at Highland Capital Partners is betting on the latter — it just led a $12 million Series A in the company. Other investors in the round include WeWork Labs co-founder Jesse Middleton and Airbnb co-founder/CTO Nate Blecharczyk.
Remote Year founder and CEO Greg Caplan told me that he first had the idea about two years ago, and when he announced it, 25,000 people ended up applying to participate in the first group of 75 — which recently completed its year abroad. Now the company has expanded to include 500 traveling professionals across six programs.
With the new funding, naturally, one of Caplan’s goals is to increase the number significantly, something that will be helped by tapping into two “mega trends.”
“First, productivity has moved to the cloud,” he said. “Great work can be done anywhere. People are more creative and productive when they’re inspired by their surroundings … The second is that we no longer value the things that we own, but the experiences we share with other people.”
To expand the program, Caplan said he will continue to grow Remote Year’s team, which is currently  85 people (As you might expect, that team is all over the world — there’s no central headquarters.) Remote Year will also be building its own physical infrastructure.
“In Croatia, for example, there wasn’t an existing coworking opportunity for us to tap into, so we created an amazing coworking space right on the beach [in Split],” Caplan said.
Remote Year participants make a $5,000 downpayment and also pay $2,000 a month for the first 11 months. That’s meant to cover travel, living accommodations and a workspace with Internet. Caplan said a cohort of 75 people feels like the right size and allows for continuity between the different programs. However, the itinerary can change from program to program — for example, some groups may consist of travelers who need to work US hours, and will therefore avoid traveling to Asia.

“The diversity that’s been most exciting for us is vocational,” he added. “We have people from all different backgrounds — a lot of engineers and designers, but the biggest category is marketing. There are journalists, writers, even a few lawyers. It’s a very, very diverse group of people in terms of where they’re from and in terms of what they do.”
Of course, it’s an intense experience, and not everyone completes the program. From a personal perspective, you can take breaks and rejoin as you please, and as for the remote working, Caplan said, “We don’t believe we can make a bad employee [into] a good remote employee, but we can make a good employee a good remote employee.”",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/remote-year.jpg?w=738,"remote-work,highland-capital-partners",Remote Year raises $12 million to combine remote work and global travel
112,Lora Kolodny,"A venture fund that backs very early-stage advanced tech and science startups, Breakout Labs, has invested in 4 new deals, according to founder and Managing Partner Lindy Fishburne.
The fund, which is part of the Thiel Foundation, typically invests $350,000 in each startup, with no strings attached. If a startup’s research and development does not lead to commercialization as hoped, Breakout Labs does not seek any money back, and counts the cash it has invested as a grant.
If a company succeeds enough to go on to raise outside venture capital, Breakout Labs’ earlier grant is exchanged for shares at a cost discount.
And if Breakout Labs companies are acquired or go public, generating returns for investors, the fund puts all of its returns into future grants for other advanced tech and science startups. Fishburne calls this approach “first mile,” funding.
Breakout Labs also pays for startup founders it has newly backed to travel to San Francisco for quarterly meetings with one another, and for its annual “Unboxing day,” where founders can show off their research, and network with potential strategic partners and venture investors.
Fishburne said if there’s one unifying theme among the companies it has backed to-date, it’s the idea of “reprogramming” nature. “We can reprogram, build and upcycle what we need from what already exists in nature, rather than passively relying on nature to deliver it to us,” Fishburne said.
Breakout Labs has invested in 30 companies so far in the fields of biotech, data and materials science, and energy. Seven of those companies have gone on to raise Series A and two have closed Series B rounds.
The four new startups that Breakout Labs has invested in are:

113,John Mannes,"Despite massive structural changes in the American healthcare system, proper care for the nation’s aging baby boomers remains out of reach for many people. Assisted living centers for our parents and grandparents suffering from dementia and Alzheimers can cost upwards of $5,000 per month and personal caregivers signed through agencies can easily cost considerably more.
A new startup, Kindly Care, is launching today with a $3.1 million investment led by MHS Capital, with participation from Floodgate and Jackson Square Ventures. The company, co-founded by startup veterans Igor Lebovic and Erik Fantasia, is rolling out a new marketplace that pairs up caregivers and care-managers so that loved ones don’t have to be left behind simply because they cannot afford one-on-one attention from traditional care providers.
“For me this was a very personal investment,” said Mark Sugarman, a partner at MHS Capital. “I was thinking about family members suffering from dementia who ended up needing care for 5-8 years. People don’t want to go to the old age home.”
To differentiate itself from other companies in the space like Care.com, Kindly Care personally vets every caregiver that signs on to its platform. This means that users can remain confident that any certifications listed are genuine and all caregivers are serious about offering their services.
To make the process of finding help more transparent, every caregiver must record an introductory video. Falling somewhere between an interview and profile, each video features identical questions about why workers decided to become caregivers, what advice they would give to peers, and who their most memorable client was. In this case, the formulaic nature of the videos actually works to the advantage of the user because it allows for effortless comparisons.

Not only does Kindly Care support the hiring of caregivers, it also supports time management and scheduling while streamlining a lot of the tax and compliance requirements that can make the job inaccessible and burdensome. This means automating payroll and on-boarding so workers don’t have to be weighted down by the complexities of social security and medicare.
The platform does a good job of distributing power across involved stakeholders. Caregivers get to set their own prices on the marketplace and care for as many people as is feasible. Care-managers get transparency into the daily mechanics of care, even seeing the locations that caregivers check-in from. This helps to curb negligence while allowing care-managers to stay involved in the lives of their loved ones by tracking regular health and scheduling reports.
To date, there are 5,000 people on the platform offering their care to those in need across California and Texas. Growth is restricted by statewide regulations, but Sugarman believes its reasonable to expect rapid domestic growth and doesn’t put future international expansion out of the question.",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/client2.jpg?w=738,"health,caregiving,population,baby-boomers",Kindly Care launches with $3.1M to help loved ones access vetted caregivers
114,Romain Dillet,"Netatmo’s first device was a sophisticated weather station. But it’s not for everyone. Chances are you don’t need to know the historical trend when it comes to the humidity in your house. That’s why the company is releasing the Healthy Home Coach, an indoor device that lets you see stats about your home at a glance.
In many ways, the Healthy Home Coach looks similar to the indoor module of the weather station. But it comes with a new mobile app that focuses on quick glanceable information — and it doesn’t have an outdoor weather module. You won’t get inundated with numbers, you’ll just see if your home is doing fine right now.
The device tracks four things — indoor air quality, humidity, temperature and noise. Air quality in particular is something that many weather stations don’t offer yet. Being able to see whether you should open your windows for a few minutes could be useful.
Finally, you can set up different profiles. For instance, you can make your device more sensitive by saying that a baby or a child with asthma sleeps in this room.
The Healthy Home Coach will cost $99. If you want, you can buy multiple devices for multiple rooms. It is available today. It’s pretty cool to see that Netatmo is launching many new devices, solidifying its reputation as a solid French hardware startup.",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/nhhc_2016_kitchen_web.jpg?w=738,"france-newsletter,netatmo",Netatmo launches an indoor climate monitor
115,Lora Kolodny,"VenueNext Inc. has raised $15 million in Series B funding to bring its venue management technology to Europe, and beyond the live entertainment industry.
Among other things, using VenueNext apps, people can wave their mobile tickets at the gate to get into a game or concert, order food, drinks or merchandise to be delivered to their seats, and get information and amenities that they need when they are in the venue.
The SAP Center in San Jose, home to the NHL’s San Jose Sharks, is the most recent major venue to adopt VenueNext for the 2016-2017 hockey season.
The Sharks join a long list of sports teams and venues to adapt VenueNext. The app will be familiar to anyone who has recently attended a game, concert or races at: Yankee Stadium, Churchill Downs, Minnesota Vikings’ U.S. Bank Stadium, Dallas Cowboys’ AT&T Stadium, Belmont Park & Saratoga Springs, and the San Francisco 49ers’ Levi’s Stadium, where it debuted.
Founded in 2013, VenueNext originally spun out of the San Francisco 49ers Stadium Technology group at a time when stadiums were investing in improved wi-fi for attendees, and beginning to favor mobile over paper-based tickets.
Causeway Media Partners led the $15 million Series B round in VenueNext, joined by food service giants Compass Group Plc, and Sharks Sports & Entertainment, along with other unnamed investors. In 2015, the company raised a $9 million Series A round. 
While VenueNext has found its early traction with stadiums and theme parks, the company’s founder, John Paul reports that hotels and hospitals are also signing up to use the app, at this point.
“In a venue, we want to improve your guest or fan experience, through your smartphone. For the venue operators, we’re helping them improve their business through real time data that we collect about who is in the building and what they are doing during an event or their visit,” he said.
One feature of VenueNext’s platform that sports organizations like, Paul said, is a ticket “forwarding” feature. This allows a ticketholder to easily give a ticket, via mobile, to friends or family when they can’t attend.
Venues can begin to know when, for example, season ticketholders attended games themselves or when they handed off tickets bringing new fans to the venue.
In some cases, VenueNext allows ticketholders to sell their unused tickets back to a team. The team can re-sell the ticket. And the original buyer gets credit to spend during their next visit to the stadium on things like a seat upgrade, a locker room tour, or food and beverages.
Sharks Sports & Entertainment COO John Tortora tells TechCrunch that his organization does not typically invest in tech startups but did so because of VenueNext’s potential, positive impact to the industry.
Tortora said, “VenueNext should help us drive greater revenue around ticket sales and food and beverage, and to deliver the best possible customer service. We also think ticket forwarding and mobile ticketing reduces the risk of ticket fraud. We faced that issue during the Stanley Cup finals.”
With the new round of venture funding, VenueNext aims to expand beyond the U.S., namely into Europe. Longer-term, it also intends to help venues and campuses make use of emerging technology from augmented reality to delivery drones.",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/san_jose_sharks_and_pittsburgh_penguins_shaking_hands.jpg?w=738,venuenext,VenueNext raises $15 million to take its app beyond U.S. sports stadiums
116,Romain Dillet,"French startup Payfit wants to modernize the good old paychecks in France. After just a few months, the company just raised $5.6 million (€5 million) from Otium Venture and Xavier Niel.
Payfit officially started in April 2016. And it looks like many companies were waiting for a product like this one given today’s funding round. Geoffroy Roux de Bézieux, Jean-Daniel Guyot, Oleg Tscheltzoff and TheFamily also invested in this round.
“Right now in France, you need to have dedicated people working exclusively on payroll functions. And if you outsource them, you lose control,” co-founder and CEO Firmin Zocchetto told me.
Payroll departments use outdated software with expensive licenses. Payfit is a software-as-a-service, meaning that everything happens in your browser, it always gets updated and you pay every month depending on the size of your company.
This alone is a big change in France as there aren’t many solutions to manage paychecks. That’s why it can get really expensive, even for a tiny company, to pay your employees.
Zocchetto walked me through the product and I was quite impressed with the interface and general philosophy. Even though I’m no HR manager, I could see myself using something like Payfit to manage contracts, salaries, vacations, tickets restaurant meals and more.
On the other end of the equation, employees can log into Payfit to download paychecks and request a vacation. And if there’s an issue, you know that you can directly talk to someone in your company about it as your company doesn’t rely on an outsourced payroll service bureau.
So far, 250 companies have signed up to Payfit, such as Heetch, Sellsy, Nestor or Aircall. They pay €39 per month and €11 per month per employee — traditional competitors tend to be more expensive than that.
The product is only available in France as this type of product tends to be very specific to one market. But Firmin told me that the startup could eventually expand to other European countries.
Payfit looks like a simple idea on paper, but it’s such an unsexy industry that there hasn’t been a lot of competition. Moreover, every company needs to manage their payroll — Payfit isn’t just something that is “nice to have.” And you don’t have to keep up with the ever-changing French law because Payfit handles it for you — this is also a good selling point.",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/moneyhands.jpg?w=738,france-newsletter,Payfit grabs $5.6 million to manage French payrolls
117,Sarah Buhr,"Zymergen, a Bay Area startup creating all sorts of materials from genetically altered microbes, just raised $130 million in Series B funding from Softbank.
For those unfamiliar, the company makes crazy new materials out of genetically altered microbes. It was busy buying up a bunch of robots to make these microbes for mass production of various materials during its last round of funding. CEO Josh Hoffman now plans to use the new funding to continue to grow the business — including adding a bunch of new staff and big name partners.

Hoffman didn’t want to say who his company might be working with but did disclose they’re all in the Fortune 500. Zymergen aims to develop better yeast strains to make foods and fragrances or narrows down the molecular properties to create new types of materials faster and cheaper for these companies.
“We’ve got a proven platform that allows us to materially improve the economics of big, mature, at-scale businesses for Fortune 500 companies. And to give you a flavor, they might have a $600 million revenue business and we can improve that margin by three to 5x,” Hoffman said. “A Fortune 500 company cares about that.”
It’s a strange new world on the cutting-edge of biology and who knows what these scientists will bid their machines and microbes to make next. But Zymergen is not unique in the space. Ginkgo Bioworks and Novozymes also work with larger companies to make crazy materials using microorganisms. Ginkgo being a small, Boston-based startup with an equally impressive amount of funding at $154 million and Novozymes as the Goliath with over $1 billion in revenue.
In any case, there are venture firms, telecoms and financial institutions with bets in the new industry and money to be made.
Softbank led the round for Zymergen and was joined by previous investors DCVC, True Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, DFJ, Innovation Endeavors, Obvious Ventures, and Two Sigma Ventures. Zymergen also received funding from new investors Iconiq Capital, Prelude Ventures, and Tao Capital Partners.

118,Romain Dillet,"It’s easy to feel like you’re missing out on a great restaurant or a nice museum when you’re walking around an unknown city. Journy wants to help you get the most out of your next vacation by planning the best itinerary for you.
Unlike many startups out there, Journy isn’t a concierge app to book flights and hotels. Journy is (mostly) about all the other activities.
“Booking a flight and booking hotels, you can do that pretty easily. But the challenge is: ‘what do I do when I get to my destination?’” co-founder and CEO Susan Ho told me.
Let’s say you’re traveling to Seoul for the first time and haven’t done your homework. You answer a survey based on what you want to do and your requirements so that Journy can come up with an itinerary. The first questions are very broad, but it can get more specific later on — for instance, if you say that you’re into shopping, Journy could ask you what type of store, what style, etc.
A few days later, you get a preview of the itinerary. You can either accept or decline — Journy cots $15 per day of itinerary. The company can book tables, hotels and more, of course. Finally, Journy doesn’t take a cut from restaurants or partners — this way, you can be sure that the startup is trying to come up with the best recommendations, not the most lucrative ones.
Journy is live in 51 cities and is adding new cities over time. The company sends you a PDF itinerary but you can also load it up in the iOS app.
And yet, this type of startups often have scalability issues. When asked about this, co-founder Leiti Hsu told me that “the holy grail is to use automation and curation for these lifestyle products.”
Over time, Journy plans to build out a library of itineraries so that it takes way less time to send back a customized itinerary. Right now, Journy is still doing a lot of things manually. But the startup will have to automate steps as much as possible if it wants to succeed.
“It takes one hour to build an itinerary. We can build itineraries for new cities in about a week,” Susan Ho said. “If you’re a college student, we could teach you how to build itineraries and that’s really the model and why we don’t need a huge team to do this. In the back end, we’re building a recommendation algorithm based on similarity scores.”
Of course, Journy will always have to tweak these itineraries depending on the number of days, the time of the year and the specific requirements. But automization could speed up the itinerary-building process and make Journy’s business model work.

119,John Mannes,"Millennials hate advertising and don’t respect brands – so what is a self-respecting 21st century marketer to do? Callum Negus-Fancey and his company StreetTeam would have you leverage the power of the upwardly mobile ambitious twenty-somethings themselves.
StreetTeam helps brands build, deploy, and manage large decentralized ambassador programs to sell more goods. The English company just closed a $10 million round led by Kindred Capital, Frontline Ventures, and Backed and managed to bring on a number of strategic investors including Universal Music Group, Saatchi Invest, and Peter Davies. The $10 million round also includes the conversion of a convertible note. Negus-Fancey is looking to bolster sales in the live entertainment industry with nothing more than a platform and an understanding of social dynamics.
You might not have heard of them, but StreetTeam is responsible for selling over 200,000 tickets to major festivals like Bonnaroo, Electric Zoo, and Spring Awakening. Of course, all of this was assembled carefully over time. The 25 year old founder has been utilizing the inherent power of friendship to sell products for over eight years.
At 17, Negus-Fancey dropped out of college to found a company called Let’s Go Crazy with his brother Liam. His idea of organizing large dance events for teenagers wasn’t new, but his execution was innovative. Rather than sell tickets himself, he recruited friends to do it and rewarded them for doing so with free tickets and backstage passes rather than cold hard cash.
The lesson he learned from his success was that for true fans, the value of one-of-a-kind rewards will always exceed the value of money. Over time, the idea became about more than just weekend parties. The company was facilitating the sale of £15 million worth of goods and it became time to rebrand as StreetTeam and dial in a formal growth strategy.
This meant hustling to build an on-boarding platform for brands that could manage new ambassadors and provide promoters with engagement data from the decentralized workforce. The data isn’t about hiring and firing ambassadors, but about collecting data to better engage with diehard fans.
One interesting way to think about the future of a company like StreetTeam is to think about open-source developer communities. Startups can stay hands off and let engineers tinker with projects that are self serving, all the while monitoring progress to recruit the best new developers. A product like StreetTeam’s could let young workers get their feet wet advocating for a brand and demonstrating their chops in a real world environment much in the same way.
“There is a push towards freelance work in a more meritocratic world where I can say here is my personal brand,” said Leila Zegna, a partner at Kindred Capital.
Moving beyond live entertainment, gadgets and gaming could offer new verticals for StreetTeam to explore. Companies like Origami Owl are already leveraging the power of strong and dedicated fan bases in unexpected industries. That company in particular allows young people to earn free jewelry by organizing company sales events.
“The human desire for advocacy and word of mouth is deeply rooted in our psychology,” Negus-Fancey told TechCrunch. “Recommendations can help us to build stronger relationships.”
The idea of not paying ambassadors may seem like a cheat, but Negus-Fancey argues that throwing money into the equation just generates excess spam and creates a disingenuous atmosphere.
For the time being, StreetTeam is running off a SaaS model with no upfront fees. The company makes money only when tickets get sold and makes a commission on each of them.",2016-10-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/instagram_latitude-01-1.jpg?w=738,"demographics,business,leverage,economy",StreetTeam locks down $10M to power ambassador programs for brands
120,Sarah Perez,"During a contentious election filled with accusations of lies and denials, not to mention overworked fact-checkers, a company that can help journalists more easily find soundbites in audio recordings, Deepgram, is making its service free to journalists. The audio search technology relies on artificial intelligence, and has been likened to a “Google for sound” – meaning that it can be used a lot like a search engine, but one that’s capable of surfacing phrases found in audio files, instead of text on webpages.
Founded by former particle physics researchers, Noah Shutty and Scott Stephenson, the idea for the startup originally came about because Shutty wanted a better way to search through its own audio files. This led him to develop the neural net-based artificial intelligence engine, which began Deepgram.
The startup this fall announced $1.8 million in funding from Metamorphic Ventures and Y Combinator.
“Searching through recordings is really difficult. In terms of workflow, usually the raw audio is transcribed into text, which is then fed into a search tool. If you transcribe using human transcription, it’s too time consuming and expensive,” explains Stephenson, in a blog post announcing the move to make Deepgram free to journalists, until Election Day.
“If you try to do it with automatic speech-to-text then search accuracy is the problem. Deepgram fixed that,” he says.
Here’s how the technology works. First, the end user uploads an audio file to the service, which can be anything – a phone call, podcast, meeting, or a video – even a YouTube URL can be used.
Deepgram then processes the speech, which is stored in what’s called a “deep representation index.” Instead of trying to translates sounds into words, Deepgram groups sounds by phonetics. Because of this, you can search for words by the way they sound and, even if they’re misspelled, Deepgram can find them.
The company claims it’s able to index audio files in less than half the time of a human transcriber, and costs 75 cents per hour of audio versus the 75 cents per minute charged by human transcription services.
Enterprise customers who use the service via API have different rates. Today, the company counts over 1,200 customers ranging from small-time hackers to call centers, police body cam manufacturers, and others.
Once indexed – a process that takes only a matter of seconds – Deepgram can find your search term in its index, and jump straight to the times the keyword was mentioned in the audio.
While the service isn’t 100% accurate, it’s able to find results 4 out of 5 times – that’s not as good as human transcription, but better than speech-to-text, which is far more error prone with a 20% accuracy rates, the company notes.
In addition, adds Stephenson, Deepgram lets “reporters listen for intonation and inflection, which are totally lost during the transcription process.”
In terms of making the technology available to the press during the election cycle, Stephenson suggests it would work well for those journalists who want to search across uploads of candidate’s speeches or TV appearances.

There’s a demo of Deepgram in action right here on the company’s blog post.
In a video of Trump’s RNC speech, you can enter in various terms in Deepgram’s search box and then be immediately taken to the part of the video where the term was spoken. For example, you can search for words like “jobs,” “taxes,” “women,” “security,” etc. The top-right of the interface also shows you how many search results were found, and the confidence level.
When the term is mentioned more than once, the recording will indicate this with red markers you can click on to jump to the next section where the term is heard.
As a savvy marketing move (but one that’s quite a perk for journalists), Deepgram is now free to accredited press up until Election Day. Reporters can request access by emailing press@deepgram.com.
Update: Deepgram has made last night’s debate video searchable, using its technology. It’s available here.

121,Steve O'Hear,"Soundtrap, a cloud-based music and audio recording platform, has raised $6 million in Series A funding. Nordic VC firm Industrifonden led the round, with participation from an array of existing investors and other new backers, including Peter Sterky, former CFO and COO of Spotify. It brings total funding to $8.5 million.
Perhaps comparable to a collaborative and multi-platform version of Apple’s GarageBand, Soundtrap lets you record music or things like podcasts and comes with its own software instruments and MIDI sequencer.
It’s available for iOS, Android, Chromebook, Mac and Windows (the latter three via a technically impressive browser-based version of Soundtrap) and it’s this cross-device compatibility where the software’s strengths really kick in.
All work-in-progress is stored in the cloud — you can pick up where you left off from one device to another — and there are features that let you collaborate with others online.
That’s because, says Per Emanuelsson, CEO and co-founder of Soundtrap, the idea wasn’t just to create something easy to use but also a tool that recognises that making music is a heck of lot more fun with others.
This, along with Chromebook support, has seen Soundtrap become popular with teachers and students, something that initially took Emanuelsson and his team by surprise. However, as of earlier this year, the Swedish startup has made education one of its explicit target markets, with educational licensing baked in.
Soundtrap is also an official Google for Education Partner, Google’s program targeting schools where Chromebook penetration is now a real thing. I’m told this is resulting in 200 new schools a week adding Soundtrap to their classroom toolkit.
Meanwhile, other investors in the company include Swedish producer and composer Andreas Carlsson; Truecaller founders Alan Mamedi and Nami Zarringhalam; Magnus Bergman, an early investor in Truecaller and Prezi; Kristoffer Melinder, Joakim Karlsson and Ulf Rosberg from Nordic Capital; Linus Andreen, CEO and co-founder of management company, record label and publishing house Aristotracks; and Lars Bergström.",2016-10-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/23878424093_b1a60abdba_o.png?w=738,,Online music and audio recording studio Soundtrap scores $6M Series A
122,Devin Coldewey,"Part of the goal of the Internet of Things, if we must continue calling it that, is improved efficiency for our newly intelligent appliances. But we could effect that in a much simpler way by passing data over the energy grid itself, suggests a successful trial in the UK.
It works by systematically modulating the 50Hz (it’d be 60Hz here in the US) signal that actually carries the electricity; previous attempts have piggybacked a high-frequency signal on the cables, but because of air gaps in transfer stations, that method was limited to local grids. This one can reach the whole country.
The signal transmitted is a simple one, carrying updates on peak times, energy prices, and regional use patterns. Once informed via the outlet, any device that’s smart enough can make minute adjustments: lower the thermostat by a degree, disable idle high-draw devices, and so on. It could even go the other way, activating A/C an hour early because prices are low.

If the idea of the national energy concern whispering to every gadget in the country seems creepy, you’ll be glad to hear that privacy shouldn’t be a problem, because the transmissions are one-way. The specialized equipment that modulates the current can’t be fit into every washer and electric blanket, after all. So they would simply receive the information and decide on their own (or at your discretion) whether to adjust to the shifting energy landscape.
Reactive Technologies created the equipment and technique for propagating the data signal, and successfully demonstrated it by tapping into the national power grid all over the country to observe a signal propagating. The company expects its first (commercial) customers within a year and half, and with luck residential deployment should come after that.",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-90589414.jpg?w=738,"smart-home,power-grid,electricity",National power grid carries data to smart appliances in UK experiment
123,Darrell Etherington,"Using a mixture of different materials in 3D printing has been difficult for the user end, requiring basically knowledge of programming and specific training, but new software developed by MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab aims to be the “Photoshop for 3D materials,” making it accessible to basically anyone.
The “Foundry” system developed by CSAIL researchers helps with advanced 3D printers like MIT’s MultiFab printer that can print in high resolution using multiple, functional materials at once, giving designers and operators a way to print complicated objects that combine different materials in a wide variety of possible ways to give different parts of the object different properties.
Foundry includes real-time previewing, so as a user is tweaking their design, they’ll see exactly what it’s going to look like in terms of output, including the ability to drill down to a cross section to see how the 3D printer will produce the internal sections of the parts and the whole.
Using the new MIT software, researchers printed a ping-pong paddle, skis with very shiny surfaces, the wheel for a tricycle, a bike helmet and a bone, which the team says could actually be used in surgical planning applications. The key is that each of these projects combined a number of different materials to achieve different functional properties in different parts of the whole.
How easy is Foundry to use? The Photoshop comparison seems apt – the MIT team behind it tested it out with non-designers, providing three different objects for them to make, including a there and wheel combo, a teddy bear and the bone structure. Users managed to create them after an hour tutorial in an average of 48, 26 and 56 minutes respectively after getting the 60-minute walkthrough.
Already, the team says its testing has resulted in a better tricycle wheel design, and the potential for similar advancements in a number of fields exists should Foundry become an industry standard. 3D printing still hasn’t replaced traditional manufacturing methods at scale, but Foundry starts to make that seem more possible on a nearer time frame.",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/3d-printing.gif?w=680,,MIT’s new software makes multi-material 3D printing easy
124,Romain Dillet,"Netatmo’s first device was a sophisticated weather station. But it’s not for everyone. Chances are you don’t need to know the historical trend when it comes to the humidity in your house. That’s why the company is releasing the Healthy Home Coach, an indoor device that lets you see stats about your home at a glance.
In many ways, the Healthy Home Coach looks similar to the indoor module of the weather station. But it comes with a new mobile app that focuses on quick glanceable information — and it doesn’t have an outdoor weather module. You won’t get inundated with numbers, you’ll just see if your home is doing fine right now.
The device tracks four things — indoor air quality, humidity, temperature and noise. Air quality in particular is something that many weather stations don’t offer yet. Being able to see whether you should open your windows for a few minutes could be useful.
Finally, you can set up different profiles. For instance, you can make your device more sensitive by saying that a baby or a child with asthma sleeps in this room.
The Healthy Home Coach will cost $99. If you want, you can buy multiple devices for multiple rooms. It is available today. It’s pretty cool to see that Netatmo is launching many new devices, solidifying its reputation as a solid French hardware startup.",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/nhhc_2016_kitchen_web.jpg?w=738,"france-newsletter,netatmo",Netatmo launches an indoor climate monitor
125,Darrell Etherington,"Huge movie company IMAX is focusing on smaller screens – but still keeping things immersive – with a push into public, shared VR experiences. The latest tentpole in that project is a brand new VR Center for Europe, one of multiple pilot locations for IMAX’s new push into virtual reality around the world, including an initial one currently being set up in LA.
The first European pilot location will be in Manchester, England, and will open before the end of 2016, according to an IMAX press release. The facilities will offer a selection of VR experiences that range from between 5 and 15 minutes, and that are sourced both from Hollywood studios and game publishers.
Eventually, IMAX says that it’s going to use the VR Centers to content it’s developing with Google using “cinema-grade” VR cameras, which, since this is IMAX we’re talking about, will probably be narrated by Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and whatever other celebrity happens to be available. IMAX is also partnering with Acer and Starbreeze on panoramic VR headset hardware.
Here’s where things start to get really dystopian – each VR Center will include several “pods,” which can work with either “single or multi-user” content and which “optimize user mobility and interaction in virtual environments.” Plus, the pod configuration are modular in a way that allows the centers to be easily reconfigured.

126,Sarah Perez,"Tile, the Bluetooth-connected lost item finder which recently rolled out a newer, thinner version of its flagship product called the Tile Slim, is out this morning with its latest, an update to the original Tile, now called Tile Mate. While still bulkier than the Tile Slim, the new Tile Mate is now 25 percent smaller than the original version, and comes with a hole that allows it to clip onto keyrings.
Tile Mate is also a touch more affordable than its thinner counterpart, at $25 versus $30 for the Tile Slim.
When introduced, the Tile Slim was meant to solve the problem of tracking items where the larger Tile would have caused problems.
For example, the original Tile would have been a big bump, if placed onto an iPad or laptop computer. It also wouldn’t have fit well in the wallet. Tile Slim changed that. But there’s still demand for the bigger, original Tile, especially given its pre-drilled hole, which lets you attach it to things like your luggage, your keys, your purse, and other items.

And if you don’t particularly need the convenience of the thin Tile Slim, you can save a little money by purchasing a Tile Mate.
Both Tiles work in the same way – by syncing them with a mobile app on your phone, you can locate items when they’re missing. But Tile is not limited by Bluetooth range. It leverages the network of Tile users to help find items that aren’t nearby. This network is fairly sizable, as well. The company has sold over 6 million Tiles to date, has a presence in more than 200 countries territories, and now locates more than a half a million things every day.
The Tile Mate ships with four preset ringtones for finding items, and can be used in reverse to find your lost phone, too.

Compared with the original Tile, the Tile Mate is 6.1 g compared with the older Tile’s 8 g. And it’s 34mm x 34mm x 4.65mm, which makes it a bit smaller than the original Tile (37mm x 37mm x 5.3mm). Both, however, are water-resistant up to IP5 standards.
Also new today, Tile is introducing a way to buy both of its trackers in a single purchase, with the Tile Mate and Tile Slim Combo Pack. This offers 4 Tiles for $90. You can buy a four-pack of Tile Mate trackers for $70, too, and current Tile customers can upgrade for a discounted price.
One of the interesting things about Tile is that it turned what would otherwise could be a standalone gadget purchase into a subscription product. Many of its competitors offer similar gadgets where you can swap out the battery when it dies, but Tile instead encourages users to upgrade and return their old device for recycling.
Customers can join the reTile program to receive new Tiles on an annual basis (as batteries last roughly a year), but at up to 50% off the original price.
In the case of the Tile Mate, reTile customers can buy a new Tile for $15 apiece.
The new Tile Mate is available online today from Tile’s website, and will be available in retailers starting tomorrow, including Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Best Buy, Sprint, T-Mobile, Target and Verizon.",2016-10-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/tile-mate-keychain.png?w=738,tile,"Tile introduces a thinner, lighter version of its Bluetooth tracker, Tile Mate"
127,Matt Burns,"Watch out, Navdy. Here comes Anker. The Chinese consumer electronic brand is about to release an in-vehicle heads-up display that appears to be similar in design and execution to the Navdy.
The product is called Roav, and like the Navdy, the device appears to take information from a user’s phone and display it on a transparent screen positioned in front of the driver. The product images show navigation, media playback information, the vehicle’s speed, and caller ID. The Roav sits on a pedestal that apparently sticks to the dashboard — just like the Navdy.
Other than a few images, not much is known about the product. We reached out to Anker for clarification but the company has yet to response. The Goroav.com and the product’s Twitter handle were created in late September. It seems like the Facebook page was made in early October.
According to the product site, the Roav is set to ship in November. Navdy is currently shipping its product to test users. General availability for Navdy’s devices has not been announced yet.
Doug Simpson founded Navdy in 2013 and has so far raised 26.8M through three rounds of funding. In 2014 the company announced the product where it quickly surpassed $1 million in pre-orders. The product was originally supposed to ship in 2015. That didn’t happen. In July 2016 the company started shipping some pre-orders to select users through a beta program.
Though revealed three years ago, Navdy has yet to face serious copy-cats. Anker’s product appears to match Navdy step for step. And if Anker’s other products are any indication, the Roav should be decent quality.
Started in 2011 by a former Google engineer, Anker is a top electronics brand on Amazon. Search the retailer for portable battery or speaker, and Anker products will be among the top results. The Chinese company sells low-priced power packs, phone cases, keyboards and mice, and products like lamps, oil diffusers and even vacuums under its new home office brand, Eufy. I’ve found Anker products to be affordable and reliable.

128,Brian Heater,"Being synonymous with a particular product category is a mixed blessing. Mophie is undoubtedly the best-known name in the battery case business, but the company has been keen to distance itself from the space a bit — or, at the very least, let it be known that it has more to offer the world.
Mophie released a whole bunch of new power banks a few weeks back. Necessary, sure, but it’s not exactly the kind of offering that’s going to make people sit up and take notice. Thankfully, the company is also starting to leverage its battery know-how for some pretty interesting products, including the Charge Force wireless charging system, the Hold Force modular phone case and this guy.

The power capsule is a compelling little product — and one I can definitely see finding a permanent home in my backpack. The product addresses quite possibly the biggest ongoing issue with Bluetooth earbuds: battery life. You see, while many of the fully wireless earbuds come with their own docks (including the ones that come with the AirPods, which more than slightly resemble a dental floss dispenser), the tethered variety are mostly on their own.
Mophie found a compelling niche and filled it with the power capsule, a Bluetooth charging accessory that doubles as a case. It’s a well-crafted peripheral with a flexible matte black top that zips together with a hardened plastic bottom, which houses a 1,400mAh battery.

On the bottom is a microUSB slot for charging the case, along with a four-light battery level indicator. Inside is a full-size USB port. Plug a small cord in (bundled with the system for an added fee — or you can just use your own) and boom, you can start charging your Bluetooth headphones on the go. Mophie rates the charge at around 60 hours — though that number is obviously entirely dependent on the brand.
You also can use the case for any other small product you might have on your person like, say, a fitness band — or a phone if you’re really in a pinch.

The $40 price point seems about right, and the build quality is solid, as well. All in all, it’s a pretty smart buy for those looking to squeeze more time out of a pair of Bluetooth earbuds.",2016-10-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_9880.jpg?w=738,"chargers,earbuds,mophie",Mophie’s charging case is a no-brainer for wireless earbud owners
129,Darrell Etherington,"Self-driving car testing in California is becoming a badge of progress for companies working in the space. Only 17 companies in total have the honor, including two just added to the list: Wheego Electric Cars and Valeo North America.
The Wall Street Journal reports that both of these new companies now have approval to run tests with a single vehicle each and four drivers per team. That might not sound like much, but it’s a foot in the door, and membership in the club is itself somewhat testament to how much the companies have already accomplished, since the other members include major carmakers like Tesla, Cruise (which got its license before being acquired by GM), promising startup Drive.ai, and Baidu, to name a few.
The new members are interesting additions: Wheego is an electric carmaker which got its start taking Chinese-built cars, outfitting them with battery’s and electric motors in the U.S. and putting them on the road. The company now says it builds electric vehicles designed “for a global market,” and focuses on the benefits of connected tech in making vehicles aware of their surroundings.
Valeo North America is a subsidiary of Valeo SA, a multinational car part supplier base in France which creates everything from powertrains, to lighting and wipers, to driving assistance and connected car components. Valeo’s autonomous test car, dubbed the Cruise4U, managed a full 24 hours on the Paris Beltway in one driving session in late September, with 99 percent of that time spent under fully autonomous drive mode, excepting the breaks it took to swap out human test drivers.",2016-10-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/cruise-4u-diaporama-1.jpg?w=738,valeo,Wheego and Valeo get California road driverless testing permits
130,Darrell Etherington,"Google’s new hardware is getting a Google-owned physical retail experience — temporarily. The search giant is opening a pop-up shop in Google at 96 Spring St. in New York beginning on October 20 called “Made by Google.” This is the same tagline the tech titan uses to market its own-brand hardware, which now includes the new Pixel, Pixel XL, Daydream View, Google Home and Google Wifi.
The plans to provide a physical location to check out the new hardware isn’t a brand new thing for Google; the company has dabbled in retail via store-within-a-store pilots similar to the way Apple operates shops within Best Buy locations, for instance. But it’s perhaps more interesting because of Google’s stated new focus on the full stack of being a hardware business, which includes the retail experience, according to a Google rep I spoke to at the company’s launch event earlier this week.
What might be more interesting are the potential future implications of the very existence of this site, and the popup.withgoogle.com domain itself. Visiting the URL shows you a “Visit Us” tab menu listing that isn’t available at the core Made by Google website just yet, and the use of “nyc” as the web address terminator suggests other cities might soon join the list.
If Google really wants to take an Apple-style, vertically integrated approach to creating devices that combine the best of hardware and software, it also has to put focus on customer experience, and retail is a big part of that for the iPhone maker. Pop-up shops could definitely help it see what the in-person experience adds to customer perception of Pixel and beyond.

131,Devin Coldewey,"Sony has a pair of new cameras for sale — though perhaps “new” isn’t the word, since they’re more like upgrades to existing devices. The price is upgraded, too. You’re not getting away for under a grand, though you’ll be getting a lot of camera for your money.

New to the V is a sped-up autofocus system, which at 0.05 seconds Sony claims is the world’s fastest, though those records don’t tend to stick around for long. 4K video is now oversampled rather than collected from binned pixels (if this doesn’t mean anything to you, don’t worry), and phase detection AF is maintained during shots, rather than switching to contrast detection.
An interesting addition is 24 FPS burst shooting in 20-megapixel RAW+JPEG for up to 150 shots. That 24 happens to be the most common cinematic framerate, meaning this thing essentially can shoot RAW video at 24 FPS for 6 seconds at a time. Having that in a pocket camera is pretty amazing — this could be a B camera on real shoots.

The a6500 is an update to the a6300, naturally, which was already a highly capable camera. What’s new is a similarly overhauled AF system, in-camera optical image stabilization, and a touchscreen. The 24-megapixel sensor is the same, but the image processor has been updated.
These improvements make the camera more approachable than its predecessor, which was praised for its versatility but not its ergonomics and interface. Hopefully Sony put some real work into the touchscreen UI.

132,Josh Constine,"650 million people use Facebook Events — 100 million every day — but it’s a smaller sect of hardcore extroverts who discover these parties and meetups, then invite everyone else.
Now Facebook is giving its most outgoing users a dedicated app for browsing and searching for stuff going on nearby. And thanks to the Facebook Events app’s ability to pull in calendars from your phone, you can see all your plans in one place, so you know when you’re free.
The Facebook Events app launches today on iOS in the U.S., and is coming soon to Android. Facebook’s core app will still offer its Events feature, so you won’t be forced to switch like with Messenger. Facebook is still considering how to promote or shortcut to the standalone product from its core app.

Facebook Events product manager Aditya Koolwal tells me, “The core thesis behind this app is that if we build something for the people really eager to discover events, people will have a good time.” The bigger goal is to find out which features work so the company can “take the best parts and put them back in Facebook.”
Events is perhaps Facebook’s most unique, differentiated feature. While you can create profiles, share content and chat on tons of services, there’s no real substitute for Facebook Events.
By doubling down with a standalone app, Facebook could make itself even more indispensable. Attending social, cultural and professional events creates memories people attribute to Facebook’s help. Events are also where people make new friends and take photos that end up bolstering Facebook’s network.
And if event promoters can get more organic reach thanks to the Events app, they’re more likely to post their events to Facebook and even pay to promote them with News Feed ads. It broadens the funnel of promoters who might potentially pay, Koolwal believes.
Events is one of Facebook’s oldest features, having launched in 2005. But while steadily growing, it was neglected until 2011 when Facebook began trying to recommend local happenings. Facebook ramped up the redesigns and recommendations in 2014, around when Mark Zuckerberg first suggested it could eventually get its own app. Events hit 450 million Events users by 2015, and this summer it started offering “Featured Events,” picked by human curators in major cities.
Last year, Facebook shut down its standalone apps incubator “Creative Labs” and several of its products, including Slingshot, Rooms and Riff. But Koolwal tells me, “Individual project teams do have some degree of autonomy to develop things.” Over the last few months, his crew has been running Events app alpha tests to find out what users would want in a standalone product.
“We went directly to the community. We did several trial runs in six cities across the U.S. with a few hundred people using it,” Koolwal explains. Users asked for easy browse-ability, powerful search and a simple way to know what was coming up.
When you launch Facebook Events, you’ll immediately see Events you’ve been invited to or RSVP’d to that day. Scroll down and you’ll get a feed of Events that Facebook thinks would interest you, based on what friends are going to, your location, your Interests, Pages you’ve Liked and other signals.

In the Search tab, you can instantly tap tiles to browse what’s up today, tomorrow or this weekend. A map lets you see events by location, which you can move around in case you’re planning a vacation or a venture to the far side of town. The search feature lets you choose certain characteristics like day, time and genre, so you can just see concerts or theater shows.
Koolwal recounts how his team was leaving a bar in San Francisco and they didn’t want to go home. One member suggested trying to find a comedy show, so Koolwal set the Events app’s search feature to find them a comedy event nearby that night. Minutes later they were in Cobbs’ Comedy Club, at an event none of them had been invited to but that was finally more discoverable.
Lastly, the Calendar feature lets you pull in your iPhone’s calendar to show you all your appointments in one place. You can sync other calendars, like Google’s, to your phone, then sync that to Facebook to pull in appointments from wherever. Koolwal says there was some hesitation amongst the team about whether to build the calendar in because it might seem too utilitarian compared to the glossy event pages people can browse, but testers wanted it. He says don’t expect a Facebook app solely for calendaring though, as the space seems pretty well handled already.
If extroverts enjoy the standalone app, it could help them dispense invitations to the rest of Facebook’s network, getting more users involved in the feature.
When I talk to people who are grumpy about the world’s incessant social media usage, many say Events is one of the features that keeps them on Facebook. While you can make profiles, share content and chat on tons of services, Facebook is still the only place to see what things friends are attending, and join in.
Facebook has long been criticized for isolating us from the real world, encouraging us to watch it through a screen instead of live it. But if the social network can find you a gallery opening, résumé workshop or tailgate in your neighborhood, that might offset those nights alone scrolling the feed.",2016-10-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/facebook-events-app.jpg?w=738,facebook-events,Facebook launches standalone “Events” discovery and calendar app
133,Keith Teare,"

The problems associated with the widespread rumors of Twitters “for sale” status and that the management team is divided on whether or not to sell the company were compounded this morning with reports that Google, Disney and Apple will not be bidders. The stock price is down 20 percent to $19.79 at the time of writing.
The impressive board of directors seems to have set itself against CEO Jack Dorsey by seeking an exit. This is not the first time the company seems to be being run by the board rather than management. Previous changes in strategy, management and even the decision to IPO do not seem to have been organic decisions planned by management, but rather reactive board-led decisions.
As anybody who has run a business knows, a board-management tug-of-war almost never results in a win. Boards hold managers accountable on behalf of shareholders, and managers run companies. It is not clear that this is the case at Twitter — and that may be the source of many of the issues. 
The board is made up of many celebrity figures, including Peter Fenton, Marjorie Scardino, Bret Taylor, David Rosenblatt, Martha Lane Fox and Omid Kordestani. Previously, Fred Wilson had also been a strong-minded board member. The board’s opinions about the strategy and tactics may reflect a weak management needing direction, or may represent frustrated operators hoping for an exit and seeking to influence day-to-day decisions. Only an insider knows. But one thing is clear, unless Twitter management actually runs the company, the future of the company will be bleak.
In this context, the big question that should be being asked is remarkably absent from the discussion. Should Twitter be sold?
Another way to ask this question is — is Twitter like Yahoo? Is the company a product of a previous era, with limited growth potential, ready to be moved to a company with deep pockets that would value the 300 million or so monthly active users?
Yes and No.

Why no? In principle, Twitter is the communications bus for the entire world. I would guess that 2-3 billion people a month see a Tweet mentioned on TV, radio, in a movie, in print. It has become an almost ubiquitous broadcast platform for anybody wishing to publish an event, an opinion, a riposte. It is a marketing platform used by every brand in the world. Compared to the other means of disseminating content, Twitter is a giant.
In its earliest manifestation, Twitter understood its position as a message dissemination infrastructure. It was happy for third parties to “carry” its messages to consumers and businesses via software integrations with its APIs. The potential reach of a Tweet was the addition of people who went to twitter.com, as well as people who used a piece of software provided by a third party to disseminate tweets. 
Others were allowed to index tweets and provide filtered views showing tweets that pertained to a topic or an interest. It was an open and widely distributed platform, somewhat like the internet itself. Search engines could index and point to it just as they do web pages.
The biggest version of Twitter one could imagine?
This stage of Twitter’s development evoked its true potential, and was the manifestation of the biggest version of Twitter one could imagine. A universal data bus for everything important now. With an index and search open to developers. 
The business model for this stage was obvious. An ad every n tweets no matter which environment the Tweet stream was consumed through, with Twitter as the “AdSense” and “AdWords” of the whole thing. This would have resulted in Google-sized revenues quickly.
The smallest version of Twitter one could imagine?
But at that time, there was a belief that Twitter needed to become a destination. This implied that any ability for a third party to take tweets and re-broadcast them through another app or site was bad. It implied that indexing and searching tweets was to be blocked, it set Twitter against its disseminators. By doing so, it limited the Twitter audience to those who directly engaged with the properties owned and operated by the company. 
This was the smallest version of Twitter one could imagine. It seems clear that many at the board level wanted Twitter to be a destination, a Yahoo if you will. And to create content “channels” that would attract the audience for the channel. And to prevent any other means of accessing those channels.
This allowed Twitter to become a branded destination and created the conditions where its key KPIs were not “tweets seen” but became “logged-in users” on a Twitter-owned property. The advertising platform Twitter has so impressively built over the past 3-4 years is based on top of this approach. 
The $2 billion or so in revenues it generates is impressive, but tiny compared to what would result from a truly universal data bus available everywhere. This would be a replacement of Google for content discovery, whereas the current Twitter is at best a replacement for Yahoo as a destination for content — and a poor one at that.

IPO was premature?
Twitter’s IPO was done before the company had truly completed its transition to becoming a content-rich destination site. The suspicion is that the need to IPO early was driven by board decisions and not organic management choice. 
Dick Costolo did an excellent job of trying to manage a ship in a storm that had only partial navigation, but the stock price ultimately reflected two things. Firstly, a company that could not accurately predict revenues and, secondly, one that had a KPI (logged-in users) that was always going to be its worst metric. The market took the direction of the board and management that Twitter wanted to be a branded portal business with advertising and measured it accordingly.
Most of the 2013-2016 ailments of Twitter emanate from this product decision and the decision to IPO before it was completely built and functioning. The management changes, the stock performance, the yearning to sell the company.

Twitter is a dysfunctional company with an interfering board and, like any dysfunctional family, it needs a divorce. A buyer would gain a clean slate and would be able to build the biggest possible version of Twitter, free of internal squabbles. 
This is the strongest case for a sale. But who should be the buyer if this outcome is wanted? There are only two good answers. One is Google, the other is a private equity buy-out.
Google is the obvious buyer. A universal data bus carrying everything that is important now to the entire world, with ads every n Tweets would probably have revenues close to and eventually surpassing web-search revenues. 
With the emergence of live video — an area YouTube should excel in — the impact of this would be compounded by the video ad opportunity. And the vision would be well-aligned with Google’s “organize the World’s Information, and make it Accessible” vision. If Google is truly out of the race, Larry or Sergey or David Drummond — call me and let me explain why you should re-consider. I’m always available at http://chat.center/keith.
If Google really is out of the running, the next best sale is to PE. Silverlake, KKR or Blackrock should look at how they worked with Skype previously and consider taking Twitter private, removing the short-term thinking and re-launch it as the biggest version of Twitter it can be. That company could own digital advertising and audience engagement for decades to come.
If neither option materializes, Twitter should take itself private — Qihoo360 just did this, as did Dell. There would be no shortage of banks interested in helping.

The board should not sell Twitter to a media or content buyer. By doing so they would cheat the world by taking away a wonderful chance to build a universal data and messaging bus able to scale to the challenges of 4 billion smartphone owners wanting news, entertainment, live video and more.
Management should go back to Twitter’s founding principles and build that universal, open, biggest possible version of Twitter.
And the markets should give the company the space to perform such a transition.

134,Natasha Lomas,"Art filter photo app Prisma is adding a big new feature to its iOS app in an update landing today: support for videos.
The app, which lets people turn their selfies into cartoonies by using deep learning algorithms to process photos in various graphic styles, quickly surged to millions of downloads in a viral splash after launching this summer. And just as quickly spawning a rash of fast following clones.
As well as creating arty selfies, users of the Prisma iPhone app can now turn snippets of video up to 15 second long into playable animations by selecting one of the nine filter styles currently available — and waiting for the app’s AI algorithms to weave a frame by frame transformation.
Turning a boring shot of a hallway into a moving comic book in a matter of minutes (as per the clip example below).
Videos can be recorded in the app or selected for processing from the camera roll. You’ll need iOS 10 for Prisma video to work, and a little patience as it can take more than a minute to process a clip depending on length, resolution and which model iPhone you’re using.
Android users will have to be more patient — as there’s still no support for video there.
Prisma says it’s planning to add offline photo processing to the Android app first, in “a week or so”, after which co-founder Aram Airapetyan says they’ll “jump on a video development”. “Android is a tough guy,” he adds.
Processing time for Prisma video on iOS is around two mins for the iPhone 6; 55-60 secs for iPhone 6s; and half a minute for iPhone 7, according to Airapetyan, although in my experience videos seemed to finish process a little quicker than that on average.
All processing is done locally on the device so expect your iPhone hardware to heat up a little as you play around with remixing videos as mosaics or Munches or manga-style cartoons.
Next up on Prisma’s iOS to-do list is adding a GIF creator — with looped video touted as coming “very soon”, aka later this month.
Rough round the edges 
Prisma video on iOS is just a beta launch at this stage, with Airapetyan touting improvements in quality coming down the pipe, and an expanded choice of art filters to style clips — adding their intention is to make all Prisma’s photo processing styles available for video, and add some new ones too.
They’re not first to the punch with art filtered video, though — others, such as the startup behind photo processing app PicsArt, got there before them. (In PicsArt’s case siloing video processing into a second standalone app, called Magic Video).
But Airapetyan is dismissive of rivals’ efforts. “We’re faster and better, taking into account the fact that we’re launching videos in beta, as the final quality will be much better,” he argues when asked how Prisma video stacks up against PicsArt’s take.
“We’ll also increase the photo styles’ quality within a couple of weeks,” he adds.
It’s fighting talk, but Prisma is clearly now having to play catch up with the competition, thanks to its early viral success.
At this beta stage the quality of Prisma video also has some rough edges. More polished looking results are possible with Magic Video — although personally I prefer the simpler Prisma interface vs all the toggles and layers available in Magic Video (but if you prefer a greater choice of editing options and tools you’ll likely disagree).
In a quick test of Prisma video ahead of the new feature launch I found results looked a little crude and were less immediately appealing vs Prisma’s art filtered photos — with a tendency towards producing flickery footage.
That said, as with the art photos, different Prisma filters can yield pretty radically different results, some of which look better than others. So you’ll want to spend some time playing around with different styles.
I found there was typically at least one style that looked interesting if not entirely pleasing. So there’s certainly fun to be had here, although perhaps less instant viral potential vs the snap and share gratification of art filtered selfies.
Here are a couple more test clips I made — using the ‘Gold Fish’ and ‘The Scream’ filters respectively:
And here’s a longer form video made by music group Tweed, apparently incorporates Prisma’s tech (although — take note — the app has a hard stop at 15 seconds of video, so you’re not going to be able to create anything as long form yourself using just Prisma, just yet)…
For both video and photos Prisma’s app does not offer as many granular controls for processing as PicsArt’s two apps do. But Prisma’s simplicity is very much part of the viral appeal here IMO. Nor does Prisma require you to register just to process a few photos… But sure, horses for courses — if you want a more fully featured image editing app then Prisma is not it.
Looking purely at the photo filter effects, I also personally prefer Prisma’s results — finding PicsArt’s results generally more garish. But again that’s a matter of personal taste.
Despite — or perhaps because of — its single feature focus, Prisma continues to rack up downloads. It tells TechCrunch it’s now had around 70 million downloads at this point, just over three months after launch.
Back in August it was running at 55M+ downloads — and the app’s early popularity attracted speculation over the summer about whether or not the team would raise VC funding to keep developing or else get snapped up a social platform giant like Instagram or Snapchat keen to beef up its own in-house content creation talent.
In the event, Prisma has done neither. Instead it has started monetizing usage via sponsored styles that are available in the apps.
Currently it has one sponsored filter launched (called Gett), with another slated as coming later this month. And the team does not seem as if it’s about to accept a big outside investment.
“I think we’re ok,” adds Airapetyan, responding to a direct question about whether they’re raising funding. But whether a new kid on the block app with millions of downloads but no social sharing platform of its own, and a bunch of copycats seeking to eat its lunch, can turn a cool feature into a sustainable business remains to be seen.",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/device-comp.png?w=738,"prisma,art-filters,video,picsart","Prisma adds art filtered video, GIFs coming next"
135,Darrell Etherington,"Instagram Stories is benefitting from the large active user base Instagram itself enjoys, and now has 100 million daily active viewers. That’s two-thirds of the daily active user population for Snapchat, which reported 150 million global active users across its entire platform in late September. Even with a built-in audience to build from, and prime real estate positioning at the very top of Instagram’s user interface, the rapid pace of its adoption is impressive.
The new stat comes from a Buzzfeed report that also reiterated the total of monthly active users across Instagram at a high of 500 million (a number it first released in June), halfway to that coveted 1 billion mark Facebook Messenger passed earlier this year.
Instagram has been around for slightly longer than Snapchat, as a six-year old company compared to Snapchat’s five, but the quick uptake of a new feature that differs dramatically from the existing Instagram experience definitely indicates that the photo-focused social network hit on a customer need when it introduced the feature. Typically, new features introduced by Facebook on its platform are initially greeted with skepticism by users who prefer the comfort of things they already know well, so early eagerness around Stories is a good indicator that it’ll continue to do well in the future.
Instagram founder Kevin Systrom told BuzzFeed that the company had initially thought about approaching ephemerality by adding a checkbox option to posts should users want their content to expire after a certain amount of time, but didn’t think that would work because of the added step involved.
The growth for Instagram is great, but it doesn’t necessarily mean bad news for Snapchat, either. While the features it designed are definitely inspired by Snapchat, it’s not necessarily the case that Snapchat users are abandoning that platform and coming over to Instagram instead (at least not en masse). As analyst Ben Bajarin notes above, the growth Instagram is experiencing is probably additive overall to the category.",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/instagram-stories.jpg?w=738,instagram-stories,Instagram Stories has 100 million daily active users after just 2 months
136,Anthony Ha,"Animoto is launching a new product for businesses that want to post their own marketing videos for Facebook and other social networks — but don’t necessarily have the team or the skills needed to create something slick.
The company already offers products that automatically assemble your photos and videos into a video slideshow, and it’s been adding more tools for businesses. However, Animoto President Jason Hsiao said the team saw an opportunity to build a new product designed for this specific need.
“We’ve been adding business-related features to our existing product, but it really kind of got to this tipping point a few years back, where we decided to just step back and see all this activity going on with business videos,” Hsiao told me. “Everyone’s now trying to create their own videos, so we really wanted to try to tackle this head on.”
CTO Stevie Clifton added that the new product was inspired by drag-and-drop website builders — in the same way that companies like Squarespace and Weebly allow you to create a website without any coding, Animoto’s Marketing Video Builder should allow you create a video without a big production budget or extensive editing skills.
The key to this approach, Clifton said, is realizing that most marketing videos can be broken down into a number of common “components,” which can then be stitched together into a video. That means the Marketing Video Builder’s interface looks pretty different from the other video editors you might have seen.
“People who aren’t video editors, they don’t want a timeline,” Hsiao said.
So he and Clifton demonstrated creating a video for me — it took only a couple of minutes to create a professional-looking marketing video. You choose from a number of possible templates, which are basically storyboards built from those smaller components. For each component, you just follow the instructions, which might mean uploading a certain number of photos or videos.
The text and fonts can be edited, you can add voiceover to each piece and you can also customize the video by adding or removing components.
“You don’t want it to look like a cookie-cutter thing,” Clifton said. “We got that direct feedback from our customers who were  worried about starting from a storyboard: ‘I don’t want mine to look like everyone else’s.’ It’s really easy to make customizations that totally depart from what the storyboard is, and [tailor] it to their own needs.”
Once you’ve created the video, you can upload it to any websites and social networks that you choose. While Animoto doesn’t offer any specific tools to customize the video to different services — say, creating one cut for Facebook and another for Instagram — Clifton said, “We’ve started to look at that problem. We don’t know exactly what our solution is going to be.”

And while Animoto’s focus does seem to be shifting to businesses, Clifton and Hsiao said the existing slideshow product isn’t going anywhere.
“If you’re doing anything heavily photo-based, or if it’s a consumer video, [the slideshow builder] is still better than anything out there,” Hsiao said.",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/drag_and_drop.jpg?w=738,"social-video,animoto",Animoto gives businesses an easy way to create social videos
137,Matthew Lynley,"Happy Twitter-versary (for the nth time around), Jack Dorsey. Things haven’t been going well, it seems, but there’s light at the end of the tunnel — Twitter may be acquired by someone somewhere in the tech (or entertainment) industry, perhaps.
To be perfectly fair, the company Dorsey inherited from his predecessor(s), including an array of former product leads as well as CEO Dick Costolo, wasn’t in that great of shape to begin. But Dorsey’s return was heralded as a return to form for Twitter, in the hope that he might come in and shake things up to the point that the company would finally turn around and make Wall Street happy.
So in the last month or so, a lot has been made as to whether the company should remain independent or whether it makes sense as part of a larger empire that can devote more resources into growing it. There are natural arguments for each — Twitter is one of the go-to sources for news (and also sports!), but a company like Salesforce could pump additional life into it to get that user base growing more broadly. And perhaps the company once again needs new, fresh blood.
Dorsey’s tried to make the service less confusing during his tenure, such as shifting around the way tweets are presented and removing some contributions toward the character limit for types of media. But the company still suffers from being confusing, being difficult to get on-boarded and, of course, harassment.
So, the turnaround still didn’t really happen. Let’s take a quick look at a few charts of what’s happened at Twitter under Dorsey.

For some reference, here’s a one-year chart of the S&P 500:

And let’s look at the user base the company reported last quarter, which has been the main sticking point for Wall Street and Twitter:

So, barely any growth whatsoever (and even a small drop-off at one point). Hmm. What about revenue growth? Under the leadership of Adam Bain this wasn’t a huge problem for a while, though everything still stems back to user growth.

And Twitter’s still losing money:

One last quick one, which isn’t exactly a chart — how much it’s paying for stock-based compensation:

Let’s cap this whole thing off with a some recent headlines:

It’s been a tough run for Dorsey, which may eventually be capped off with a final sale to a company. Anything can change at the last minute, of course, but for the time being it seems like Twitter needs to right itself — whether that’s through increasingly drastic internal changes or bringing in new leadership under new ownership to do just that. And there’s always next year!
Twitter’s third-quarter earnings come out later this month, and it’s kind of hard to believe that this may be the final time we see the guts of the company for the foreseeable future. It may end with a final sign-off like LinkedIn: “In light of the pending merger, LinkedIn will not be updating its outlook for fiscal 2016 and will not be hosting a conference call for its second quarter 2016 business results.”",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-545233570.jpg?w=738,"jack-dorsey,ev-williams",A few charts that sum up Jack Dorsey’s first year as Twitter CEO
138,"Josh Constine,Katie Roof","Twitter once tried to buy Shots for $150 million to score its 3 million rabid teen users, a source tells TechCrunch. But the Justin Bieber-funded selfie app developer dreamed of a different destiny, where it would become the “Saturday Night Live” of the mobile generation.
The Shots app grew to a peak of almost 8 million users, but ultimately it was too difficult to compete with Instagram and Snapchat. Despite a shift to comedy and acquisitions like lo-fi video capture app Camcorder and music video maker Mindie, the Shots team decided they were better off as a content creator.
Social media stars from Vine, Instagram and Snapchat befriended the startup. The Bieber affiliation gave it credibility, and co-founder John Shahidi’s “I’m on the creator’s side” stance fostered trust with multi-million view video makers like Lele Pons and Rudy Mancuso. Shahidi discovered that as long as these web celebs kept pumping out funny skits, their fans would follow them from one social media platform to the next.

So over the past few months, Shots has rebranded as Shots Studios, and turned its focus from apps to the content people share on them. It’s taken stars who built their fame in still Instagrams, 6-second Vines and off-the-cuff Snapchat clips, and helped them shoot high-production four-minute YouTube videos.
The result? Millions of views per video, strong ad revenue and, according to a source close to the company, sudden partnership interest from Facebook, Netflix and Verizon that could potentially spill into acquisition talks.

All except Bach have exclusive deals with Shots which takes a revenue cut of their earnings that John Shahidi wouldn’t specify but that he called “creator friendly”. In exchange, creators get access to a production team including a film crew, writers, and editors; brand management; sales help; and access to Shots’ data and growth teams.
While the startup declined to comment on specific discussions, Shots Studios insists that they are not focused on selling the company right now. Their new business model has been building momentum and the company is a few months away from profitability, due to ads and partnerships with Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and American Express. Shots will still run its app, but the team is concentrating on video production and distribution.
Content creation has become a growing business, with mobile video consumption skyrocketing in the past few years thanks to better cameras, screens and wireless networks. Advertisers are looking to reach these viewers, particularly in the young demographic that Shots caters to, and video ads pay much more than their annoying banner cousins.
If executed correctly, Shots’ plan could ultimately lead to a big exit for the company. Maker Studios was acquired by Disney for more than $500 million. Fullscreen also found a lucrative outcome. 

Anything at or above that original $150 million price Twitter dangled would be a big win for Shots’ investors. It has raised $15 million in funding; investors include 500 Startups, Floyd Mayweather and Major League Baseball. And Shots’ most famous investor, Justin Bieber, is more involved than ever. The star got his own start on YouTube and we’re told that he’s very enthusiastic about helping the next generation of artists.
And that concept of creating as a team could be Shots’ greatest strength. Each of its affiliated stars do cameos in each others’ videos and cross-promote them to their own fans. That strategy let the Shots family of stars become the oligarchy ruling Vine’s Popular page. Now the startup will give them the spotlight for a lot longer than six seconds.",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/lele.png?w=738,"shots,justin-bieber,vine",Shots Studios rebrands from selfie app to social star video factory
139,Matthew Lynley,"Today, Pinterest announced that it has hired its first chief financial officer from Twitter, Todd Morgenfeld. However, there’s a more interesting footnote that’s reported in The Wall Street Journal’s story about the hire: Pinterest generated roughly $100 million in revenue last year, according to the report.
You may recall that last year TechCrunch reported, based on leaked documents we received, that the company was projecting around $169 million in revenue for 2015 (and $2.8 billion by 2018). We reported the story in October last year, and the information was used by Andreessen Horowitz to solicit limited partners to invest in a special investment fund for Pinterest earlier in the year.
So, what’s going on with the discrepancy here?
Facebook’s advertising business continues to chug along at a very healthy rate. We also reported that a leaked deck from Snapchat noted that the company had estimated that revenue would be between $250 million and $350 million for 2016, and could have been as high as $1 billion for 2017. Both of these mobile advertising strategies appear to not only be working, but growing really quickly.
Was Pinterest, in the end, still a little bit of a question mark for marketers? Most of the content that appears on Pinterest comes from businesses, and it possesses a large user base. But it may be that advertisers are still apprehensive about shifting budgets from other services like Facebook — or even emerging ones like Snapchat, which could pique greater curiosity because of their rapid growth and engagement. (Snapchat has around 150 million daily active users.)

Pinterest tries to offer a different value proposition for marketers. Brands are able to touch its users at multiple points of their buying cycles. Users can discover products through advertising tools, making them aware of their existence. Marketers can also tap into a user’s intent to potentially purchase through search. And finally, they can also hit them at points where they are ready to finally make a purchase of those products (or download an app, for example).
To be sure, Pinterest has been very methodical about expanding its business, slowly opening up advertising tools to wider and wider audiences over time. It may be that the company put the brakes on certain ad and commerce product releases until it felt like they were ready. Our reporting pointed at the projection coming from earlier in the year from when we published our story.
Perhaps the company may have been a little ambitious in its plans. This isn’t, of course, unheard of. Companies sometimes may offer a wide range of potential projections — such as the case of Snapchat, which the leaked deck shows its 2017 revenue could range from $500 million to $1 billion. Snapchat, too, has slowly been rolling out its plans for working with marketers, meaning that the final numbers that may land may end up partially (or wildly) different from the estimates offered to investors.
New advertising formats are also emerging on Pinterest, but are sometimes coming out quite a bit later than other platforms. In August, the company finally released native video advertising following the release of a native video player. Facebook, meanwhile, has had a robust video ecosystem and is clearly figuring out ways to monetize it.
That’s likely the reason why Pinterest is investing so much in its visual search tools. At an event earlier this year, Pinterest revealed that it would soon give users the ability to search for products through photos taken on your smartphone. One of Pinterest’s perceived edges is its heavy research and development in visual search, and it also recently began expanding those tools into video. Pinterest needs to find an obvious edge that can convince marketers to pull their budgets away from search (Google), Facebook and other advertising platforms.
It’s also expanded very aggressively into international markets. And it’s continuing to release more and more advertising tools. AND it continues to not only acquire companies for talent, but also some additional products like Instapaper. All of this is, of course, feeding into the company’s intent to become the visual search engine of record on the internet.
Then, there’s the case of its commerce plans. The company is trying to offer as many commerce tools as possible for its companies — and potentially to attract influencers — with things like the Buy button and showing products below videos. But buyable pins on Pinterest only came out in June last year, and it’s hard to create new user behavior (much less get people to put in a credit card), and it’s only been a short while since launch, relatively speaking.
The hiring of a CFO can, sometimes, signal ambitious plans to organize an inevitable initial public offering. A Pinterest representative told me over email that the company has “no plans for an IPO right now, as we focus on growing the business.” So Morgenfeld’s task may be to get things in order as it continues to try to woo advertisers and marketers.
We reached out to a Pinterest representative about the discrepancy, who said the company does not comment on revenue.",2016-10-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/visual-search-on-pinterest.jpg?w=738,"todd-morgenfeld,pinterest",Pinterest lagged behind leaked revenue projections in 2015
140,Matthew Lynley,"Pinterest has hired its first chief financial officer, Todd Morgenfeld — who was most recently vice president of finance at Twitter — the company said today. He was at Twitter for about a year and a half before joining Pinterest.

A representative from Pinterest said the company has “no plans for an IPO right now, as we focus on growing the business.”
“We are excited that Todd is joining Pinterest as CFO,” CEO Ben Silbermann said in a statement. “Todd brings to the company a wide range of experience from HP to the military to a fast paced environment like Twitter. He believes in our mission and the strong business opportunity it presents. We are committed to building our company for the long term and thrilled that Todd will be an integral part of continuing this growth.”
Pinterest has been aggressively expanding its advertising and commerce tools as it looks to begin generating a healthy amount of revenue. In 2015, leaked documents showed Pinterest was forecasting around $169 million in revenue, as well as a forecast of $2.8 billion in annual revenue in 2018. The company was most recently valued at $11 billion in a financing round. Of course, these forecasts can change as the year progresses, and the documents were released earlier last year.
Still, things might be a little challenging for Morgenfeld. The Wall Street Journal is also reporting that Pinterest generated roughly $100 million in revenue, which could mean it fell below the forecast laid out in the previously leaked documents. The company has released a large number of advertising tools as it looks to offer marketers an alternative option than Facebook and Google, banking on giving marketers access to multiple parts of the purchasing cycle.
Twitter, too, was in a challenging position under Morgenfeld. The company since its initial public offering has had to deal with stalling growth and a frustrated Wall Street, as it tried to put together a strong business proposition that would keep it an independent company. Earlier this month it was revealed that a number of companies, including Salesforce and Alphabet, are looking at snapping up the company as it might make sense in the context of a greater tech empire.
(Obviously Morgenfeld wasn’t running the show at Twitter, as Anthony Noto serves as the company’s CFO.)

141,Natasha Lomas,"The messaging wars are really a battle for attention. It’s all about which comms app giant can embed the stickiest and most addictive features into their platform to keep users inside their own well-tended garden, rather than peering over the wall at rivals’ plots.
In Facebook’s case today, that means launching a pared down version of its Messenger app to try to extend the edges of its messaging empire to markets where users may not have great Internet and/or a high end smartphone.
But, also today, messaging app Telegram is going the other way: announcing it’s powering up on the chatbot front with the launch of what it dubs a “bot-powered gaming platform” in a bid to try to drive more engagement via addictive new features.
The v3.13 update is now live for Android Telegram users to download, and will also land in the App Store for iOS users today.
Integrated HTML 5 games inside chats
While devs building for Telegram’s open platform could already make text-based bot games for the app — see, for example, PokerBot or WerewolfBot — the new API seeks to step up the stickiness by enabling more visually appealing games to live inside chats on the platform.
“You can now use bots to play games in your chats, complete with graphics and sound,” Telegram writes in a blog post announcing the new feature.
Examples it showcases in the post include a math based challenge game, called MathBattle, that it says its own developers built in three hours, and a football game called Football Star, built by a third party.
Other examples shown in the post include time-challenge games — such as Corsair, where you have to see how long you can avoid being shot, or, in the case of Lumberjack, avoid being crushed by falling tree branches.

So basically this is super simple mobile games embedded into the chat window and made inherently competitive thanks to an automatic running tally of your contacts’ scores that Telegram’s API enables.
“The best part of the Telegram Gaming Platform is the competition across all your existing chats. We save high scores for every game played in every chat, and you can instantly check out how you and your friends are doing against each other. Every time there’s a new leader in the game, other playing members of the chat are notified that they need to step it up,” it notes.
There’s about 30 games at launch, with the vast majority made by third party games developer Gamee. Albeit Telegram is obviously hoping for lots more to flood in — suggesting today that “hundreds” are in the pipeline.
“While these demos look basic, Telegram games can be anything from simple arcades and puzzles to multiplayer 3D-shooters and real-time strategy games,” it adds.
Betting big on bots
Telegram was a relatively early mover in the chatbot space, launching a bot platform back in June 2015 — months before the likes of Facebook and Line got in on the action, although lagging China’s WeChat platform (which has had automated accounts since 2013).
The question of how popular bots end up being with users of messaging apps in the Western world remains to be definitively answered at this nascent stage. Really that depends on whether bot makers can prove their creations have staying power and offer more than a bit of gimmicky novelty. And so far, despite all the hype, bots have been fairly underwhelming.
Telegram hasn’t quantified user engagement with bots via any solid metrics as yet. And it’s fair to say that Facebook Messenger’s early clutch of chatbots roundly failed to impress — it’s since tried to hone the user experience to dial down user confusion, so a fairly inauspicious start there.
Add to that Telegram, and most recently Line, has been actively trying to encourage developers to build “useful bots”, offering cash prizes as a lure. So it seems safe to file much of this chatbot activity under ‘work in progress’ at this stage.
That said, combining bots with gaming seems a smart move — with the potential to convert group chats into competitive, multiplayer gaming sessions with minimal effort (with the caveat that it might also get really annoying, a la FarmVille Facebook spam, from back in the day) — and thereby ramp up messaging engagement as friends battle it out to see who has the fastest mental arithmetic or dodging skills or history knowledge or whatnot.
Telegram is pitching developers to port existing HTML5 games to its platform to quickly build out the number of games its hosting — touting the process as quick and easy.
“The new API is pretty straightforward, so any developer of an existing HTML5-based game can integrate it with the Telegram social graph and competitive leaderboard in a matter of a few hours,” co-founder Pavel Durov tells TechCrunch.
On the user side, to access gaming bots within a chat a user needs to @ the relevant bot to get instructions on how to start playing. For example, to launch the MathBattle bot a Telegram user types @gamebot into any chat and then selects ‘MathBattle’.
The platform automatically keeps tabs on scoring, maintaining a competitive leaderboard across all their contacts and gaming titles in play. And this is where Durov reckons things will get really sticky.
“I think the competitive factor is a game changer here,” he says. “Since every group chat can now be instantly turned into a competition in anything. It can even become a competition in History or Math.”
Let’s just hope things don’t get really spammy. Choose your games (and your Telegram contacts) wisely.
Gamee’s CEO and co-founder Bozena Rezab side-steps a question about how long it took the company to reincarnate 23 of its existing HTML5 titles as Telegram bots, noting only that it already had a lot of experience with social gaming. But she was happy to talk up the potential of melding bots and games — dubbing it a “new era in casual gaming”.
“It is very exciting to play games in the environment, where communication with friends happens,” she said via email. “Telegram has the most advanced inline bot API, which makes it possible to play and compete with groups of friends directly in the chat, no barriers.”
How is Gamee intending to monetize its Telegram gaming bots? The short answer is it’s not — at least not right now. “We do not focus on monetization here at this point,” she said.
So that’s another question mark over the longevity of bots — at least until a mechanism arrives for monetizing them. However Durov has previously said a payments mechanism is coming for Telegram bots this year, and he confirms to TechCrunch that the team is still on track for a 2016 launch. So devs will be hoping they won’t have too long to wait.
Telegram also claims its new gaming platform doesn’t bloat the platform — requiring in its words “0 bytes of disk space”. “The underlying technology is HTML5, so games are loaded on-demand as needed, just like ordinary webpages,” it adds.
Support wise, the new chatbot-powered games will work on iPhones 4 and newer and on Android 4.4 devices and newer. Users will need Telegram v3.13 to be able to play.

142,Natasha Lomas,"Facebook is seeking to fill in some of the gaps in the reach of its messaging app empire, announcing today a new standalone version of its Messenger app, Messenger Lite, specifically designed for older Android devices with limited storage and for slower, data-constrained Internet connections.
Idea being that not everyone in the world has the premium hardware and superfast data connectivity that its full-fat messaging product assumes.
“With Messenger Lite, people are able to quickly and easily send text, photos and links to anyone using Messenger or Messenger Lite,” writes Facebook introducing the new app.
Or of course they could just use SMS.
The move follows Facebook launching a stripped down version of its main Android app for users in emerging markets last year. That app, called Facebook Lite, eschews data-intensive content like video and location-powered features like Nearby Friends to offer a more basic feature set and low res imagery in an app that’s less than 1MB in size.
Earlier this year Facebook revealed usage of this no-frills Facebook app had ballooned to 100 million monthly actives just nine months after launch, confirming it as its fastest growing app at that point — a growth trick it’s clearly hoping to repeat now with Messenger Lite.
Albeit Messenger Lite is not so modest in size: Facebook says the new stripped down Messenger is around 10MB. Although Android hardware continues to improve, even at the affordability focused end of the pipe. 
In terms of features, Messenger Lite supports what Facebook dubs “core experiences” — namely: “messaging, sending and receiving photos and links, and receiving stickers”. Yes, stickers aren’t a nice-to-have in the hyper competitive world of mobile messaging. 
Facebook says Messenger Lite for Android is starting to roll out, initially to Kenya, Tunisia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Venezuela — with other countries slated to be added in the “coming months”.
Last year rival messaging app Line also launched a stripped down Android app aiming to win users in a swathe of emerging markets, called Line Lite. So if Facebook doesn’t grab these users, another messaging player surely will.
Facebook has also previously launched Facebook Zero, a text-only version of its website that was subsidized by carriers — another on-boarding strategy for users in emerging markets.
But one of its most aggressive strategies for growing usage of its mobile messaging empire, and thus also getting its hands on users’ phone numbers, is shuttering access to messages within its mobile app — thereby forcing users to download Messenger if they wish to continue their conversations. (It’s even been excising messages from the mobile web version of its website.)
This user-hostile strategy has nonetheless inflated Messenger usage. But then if you force people to download an app in order to read messages from friends you are doing the equivalent of twisting their arm behind their back.
We’ve asked Facebook whether it will be removing access to messages from its web app for users in the markets where it’s launching the new Messenger Lite for Android and will update this post with any response. It seems prudent to expect this to happen though, assuming it hasn’t already done so… Update: Facebook declined to provide an on-the-record statement about this.
Facebook’s aggression with Messenger looks especially gratuitous when you consider it also owns mobile messaging giant WhatsApp. So it has not one but two 1BN+ mobile messaging platforms under its control and command.
But hey, if you’re in the user data-mining ad profiling business then sucking up as much personal data as possible is the name of the game.
Also not surprising: Facebook-owned WhatsApp recently announced it would start sharing user data with its parent company for ad targeting purposes, in a bid to triangulate yet more information on users of the two services.
So you could say: resistance is futile. Although of course other messaging apps and platforms are available.",2016-10-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-03-at-9-08-08-am.png?w=721,"messenger,facebook-messenger",Facebook launches pared back Android chat app to keep growing its messaging empire
143,"Josh Constine,Natasha Lomas,John Biggs","Facebook is stealing the Stories format and invading countries where Snapchat isn’t popular yet. Today in Poland it launched “Messenger Day”, which lets people share illustrated filter-enhanced photos and videos that disappear in 24 hours, just like on Snapchat.
By using the international popularity of Messenger to spread the Stories format, Facebook could boost retention and return visits to its chat app while becoming the primary place where people post off-the-cuff lifecasting content before they get hooked on Snapchat.

Sources in Poland spotted Messenger Day and sent TechCrunch’s John Biggs these screenshots. We reached out to Facebook for comment, and it told us “We know that people come to Messenger to share everyday moments with friends and family. In Poland we are running a small test of new ways for people to share those updates visually. We have nothing more to announce at this time.”
Additionally, Facebook says it frequently runs small tests before rolling products out to other regions, but there’s no guarantee it will expand this feature beyond Poland. It’s unclear, but Facebook might not bring it to the US unless it really blows up abroad. 60 million people in the US and Canada already use Snapchat daily, and aggressively pushing Messenger Day there could annoy them. But in countries where people aren’t that familiar with Snapchat, it has nothing to lose by experimenting.
Much of the feature works exactly like Snapchat Stories, with the ability to draw or add text to images. Facebook’s one big innovation with Messenger Day is the use of graphic filters as suggestions for what to share, instead of just to celebrate holidays and events or to show off your location like with Snapchat’s geofilters.

At the top of the Messenger thread list, users see a row of tiles representing “My Day” and friends’ Days they can watch, but there are also prompts like “I’m Feeling”, “Who’s  Up For?” and “I’m Doing”. Tapping on these tiles provides a range of filters “I’m feeling…so blue” with raindrops and a bubbly blue font, “I’m feeling…blessed” with a glorious gold sparkly font, “Who’s up for…road trip” with a cute car zooming past, or “Who’s up for…Let’s grab drinks” with illustrated beer mugs and bottles that cover the screen.
This feature allows people to share visually appealing images even if they aren’t great artists or especially creative. These prompts could also spur usage when people are bored, sparking their imagination.
Messsenger is already an app people use all day with close friends, so it could end up a better home for the Stories format than cramming it into Facebook’s core app, which the company tested as “Quick Updates” and scrapped.
The Stories slideshow format has proven to be a powerful way to share more than the perfectly polished pics people post to Instagram. That’s why Instagram launched its own clone of Snapchat Stories, but its CEO Kevin Systrom admitted “They deserve all the credit”. But Facebook suffers from the same problem of people only sharing their biggest life highlights, which don’t happen that often. Facebook is already so stuffed with features and probably isn’t opened as frequently as Messenger.
Now Messenger Day wants to make this casual sharing option ubiquitous before Snapchat can. That’s a similar strategy to Instagram Stories, which I hear is flourishing in places like Russia where Snapchat adoption is low. This is the benefit of Facebook being a giant company earning $2 billion in profit a quarter. It can clone fast thanks to its enormous team, translate and localize features for testing in certain markets, and cross-promote what works with its inescapable feed and chat apps.
Messenger Day might not lure many people away from Snapchat, but Facebook could stunt its competitor’s growth by racing to to bring its own Stories to the unclaimed corners of the earth.",2016-09-30,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/messenger-snapchat.png?w=738,"snapchat-stories,facebook-messenger",Facebook “Messenger Day” is the chat app’s new Snapchat Stories clone
144,Natasha Lomas,"A dramatic privacy about-face by messaging app WhatsApp this summer, in which it revealed an update to its T&Cs would for the first time allow the sharing of its user data with parent company Facebook, is getting the pair into hot water in Europe.
This week Facebook was ordered to stop harvesting data on WhatsApp users in Germany by the Hamburg city DPA, which hit out at the controversial change to WhatsApp’s T&Cs as both misleading to users and a breach of national data protection law. (Facebook disagrees, and is appealing the order in Germany.)
It now looks the UK’s national data protection watchdog, the ICO, is preparing to ramp up its action too. The ICO had already been — in its words — “considering” the deal, questioning whether the two companies were being transparent with users about how their data is being shared and used.
But speaking to the BBC’s PM program on Radio 4 yesterday, information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said it has launched “an investigation into the data-sharing”.
Asked by the BBC whether the ICO intends to follow the Hamburg DPA’s lead and order the data-sharing to be stopped, Denham said: “My intervention is an advocacy intervention on behalf of all of the WhatsApp users in the UK — and boy have we heard from them! They are quite concerned.
“There’s a lot of anger out there. And again it goes back to promises, commitment, fairness and transparency. We have launched an investigation into the data-sharing, remembering that in 2014 when Facebook bought WhatsApp there was a commitment made that between the two companies they would not share information.”
The new WhatsApp T&Cs state that user data — including the mobile number used to register to use the service and a user’s last seen time within the app — will be shared with Facebook and the “Facebook family of companies”, including for marketing and ad targeting purposes.
Users reading the T&Cs before clicking ‘I agree’ might notice that there is a way to opt out of the data-sharing for ad targeting — but the agreement default opts users in, and the text next to the toggle to refuse to share is arguably confusingly worded. So it’s likely that many WhatsApp users will have agreed to the new privacy policy without realizing that means they are now handing data to Facebook.
“It’s an active and important investigation,” Denham added, during the PM interview. “I know the public wants to hear from us as to what we’re doing — and you will hear from us very shortly.”
A spokeswoman for the ICO could not confirm whether or not the ICO has a formal investigation into the data-sharing underway at this point, but did say it would be putting out an update soon, perhaps later today or on Monday.
In the PM interview, Denham was also pressed on whether the ICO is doing anything to stop data flowing now, while it probes the arrangement, but she said she thinks no data is yet flowing from UK WhatsApp users to Facebook.
“We are told that data is not yet being shared — so I am hoping that there is a pause in the data-sharing, and some rethinking of the terms and the consent and what data is being shared,” she said.
We’ve asked Facebook to confirm whether or not it is harvesting UK WhatsApp data at this point or not and will update this post with any response.
Making a general statement about the data-sharing agreement earlier this month, Europe’s Article 29 Working Party, the data protection body that represents the collective views of the DPAs of all 28 Member State of the EU, asserted that: “Users should keep control of their data when Internet giants massively compile it.”
Denham also referenced the WhatsApp-Facebook privacy controversy in other public comments this week, making her first public speech since taking over the role from the prior ICO, Christopher Graham.
Speaking at an event in London she noted: “We are currently reviewing data sharing between WhatsApp and other Facebook companies — all of this is about transparency and individual control.”
(Ironically that event, a one day conference entitled Personal Information Economy 2016, organized by a business consultancy called Ctrl–Shift, was funded with the help of Facebook cash — the event organizers confirmed to TechCrunch Facebook was one of the sponsors. So no surprise another of the speakers was Facebook’s Stephen Deadman, aka its global deputy “Chief Privacy Officer”. Ctrl Shift said all sponsors for the event were “printed clearly” in the event brochure that was shared with delegates on the day.)
In a wide-ranging first public speech that set our her priorities for leading the UK regulator through turbulent post-Brexit times, Denham said the ICO intends to pick and choose its investigations with the aim of maximizing its impact — to, as she put it, “enable results which can cascade across a sector”.
She added that technology is “already at the forefront of most of our major investigations”, noting that the ICO has also been asking questions about the massive Yahoo data breach, finally confirmed last week.
“As an independent regulator we have powers to issue fines of up to half a million pounds which could eventually rise to four percent of a business’ global turnover,” she warned. “In an ideal world we wouldn’t need to enforce, but we will use the stick in the cupboard when necessary. And remember it’s not just about the money — it’s about your reputation too, with your customers, the public and in the media spotlight.”
EC’s competition commissioner also eyeing big data and privacy
The Facebook-WhatsApp data-sharing agreement has also caught the attention of the EC’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, who earlier this month revealed her department was asking questions about the privacy policy changes, noting that the fact they didn’t merge data was factored in when the acquisition was approved.
Speaking at a conference on big data in Brussels this week, Vestager argued for the need for EU-wide regulation on data — referencing the Facebook-WhatsApp controversy and suggesting new rules are needed to enable the region’s regulators to keep up with tech giants’ use (and potential misuse) of data.
“Europe’s competition enforcers need to work together on big data — not just the Commission, but the national competition authorities as well,” she said. “Many of them are already doing that. Our French colleagues have launched a sector inquiry on big data. And the German authority is looking at whether Facebook may have misused its power to impose unfair privacy terms.
“But if we want to be able to deal with big data issues throughout the EU, then every national authority has to have the tools it needs to enforce the rules… I think there’s a strong case for new EU rules as part of the answer.”
Big data as a currency that can be used by tech giants to stifle competition is a theme Vestager has spoken on several times before.

145,Natasha Lomas,"Art photo filter app sensation Prisma, which only launched this summer but racked up more than 55 million downloads in a matter of weeks, has sparked a rush of other photo-processing apps all promising to transform your selfies into art fit to hang on the wall.
But can a Prisma smartphone snap actually make the leap from the screen to your wall? Or is the splurge of colorful, pixelated virality only good for virtual appreciation?
Veteran print-your-own photos-on-canvas player CanvasPop has spotted what it hopes will be a lucrative opportunity to monetize the sudden glut of arty selfies appearing on Instagram et al — and says it’s been working with Prisma to help users turn their snaps into canvases they can really hang on the wall.
It does already offer a service for printing Instagram and Facebook photos. But is evidently hoping Prisma’s trendy art filters spark a run of new orders — with co-founder Adrian Salamunovic telling TechCrunch this summer it begun seeing “hundreds” of orders coming in with a painterly effect that it was quickly able to attribute to the Prisma app.
He says it’s now in discussions with Prisma about integrating CanvasPop’s API with their iOS and Android apps.
For now Prisma users wanting to convert their digital works of art into bona fide wall art need to visit the CavasPop website themselves where it has added a dedicated Prisma section.
CanvasPop offered to let TechCrunch try out the Prisma printing service. And try we did.
Here’s the Prisma photo we sent to test out the canvas print quality:

And here’s the resulting CanvasPop print, propped up artfully against a wall…

You can see shots of the print detail in the gallery below, plus a few photos of the unboxing.
CanvasPop offered us two print sizes to test the service: 12″ x 12″ or 20″ x 20″ — although its website has far more options (including custom sizes).
We opted for the larger of the two sample sizes to see how well the service handled a bigger blow-up. The result was a print of fairly decent quality.
The canvas does have a slight sheen to it, a finish which may or may not be to your liking (but likely makes the print more durable), and there was one teeny printing imperfection on the brunette’s black hair, but nothing you couldn’t easily fix with a sharpie.
The color reproduction looks slightly off to my eye — with tones coming out a bit more saturated and therefore garish than the photo appears (at least when viewed on iPhone or Mac screens). Color fidelity isn’t substantially skewed though, just expect tones to pop a bit more than you might think.
Salamunovic says smaller print sizes generally result in a “cleaner” looking print but he also touts the company’s “very deep knowledge” in working with low res images, due to its early involvement with Instagram filter photos, so argues it can certainly handle larger sizes too.
The largest fixed size print the website offers for Prisma prints is 61cm x 61cm, but presumably you can request larger still via a custom order (although going much bigger than that is probably not a great idea if you want a reasonable looking result).
“We specialize in printing low resolution images in large format,” says Salamunovic. “We’ve been doing it since 2009, the early days of iPhone 3 images and then Instagram. We were the first company to print Instagram images large format.”
Whether a Prisma photo works as wall art is another matter. Really, that’s a matter of personal taste. If you’re the sort of person who’s happy to hang an Ikea print of a stack of pebbles in the middle of your living room then printing your own Prismas at least means you’re going to end up with something a lot more original.
“Tens of millions of Prisma images have been generated — we want to take the best images and print them as art,” adds Salamunovic. “There’s a huge market for what we’re calling ‘self-generated art’ and Prisma is one of the leaders in the space.”
On the cost front, CanvasPop’s pricing varies depending on size and whether you opt for just a rolled print in a tube or full on fancy framing options such as wooden edges to a stretched canvas. It’s also offering framed paper prints.
The 20″ x 20″ canvas size that CanvasPop printed for TechCrunch is priced at $114.
While a 12″ x 12″ canvas without a frame, so arriving rolled up in a tube, would be a far more affordable $35. (But of course you’d also need to frame it and affix a hanger yourself.)
At the other end of the scale, the largest fixed size options with the fanciest frames can push the per print price past $250.

146,Steve O'Hear,"Soundtrap, a cloud-based music and audio recording platform, has raised $6 million in Series A funding. Nordic VC firm Industrifonden led the round, with participation from an array of existing investors and other new backers, including Peter Sterky, former CFO and COO of Spotify. It brings total funding to $8.5 million.
Perhaps comparable to a collaborative and multi-platform version of Apple’s GarageBand, Soundtrap lets you record music or things like podcasts and comes with its own software instruments and MIDI sequencer.
It’s available for iOS, Android, Chromebook, Mac and Windows (the latter three via a technically impressive browser-based version of Soundtrap) and it’s this cross-device compatibility where the software’s strengths really kick in.
All work-in-progress is stored in the cloud — you can pick up where you left off from one device to another — and there are features that let you collaborate with others online.
That’s because, says Per Emanuelsson, CEO and co-founder of Soundtrap, the idea wasn’t just to create something easy to use but also a tool that recognises that making music is a heck of lot more fun with others.
This, along with Chromebook support, has seen Soundtrap become popular with teachers and students, something that initially took Emanuelsson and his team by surprise. However, as of earlier this year, the Swedish startup has made education one of its explicit target markets, with educational licensing baked in.
Soundtrap is also an official Google for Education Partner, Google’s program targeting schools where Chromebook penetration is now a real thing. I’m told this is resulting in 200 new schools a week adding Soundtrap to their classroom toolkit.
Meanwhile, other investors in the company include Swedish producer and composer Andreas Carlsson; Truecaller founders Alan Mamedi and Nami Zarringhalam; Magnus Bergman, an early investor in Truecaller and Prezi; Kristoffer Melinder, Joakim Karlsson and Ulf Rosberg from Nordic Capital; Linus Andreen, CEO and co-founder of management company, record label and publishing house Aristotracks; and Lars Bergström.",2016-10-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/23878424093_b1a60abdba_o.png?w=738,,Online music and audio recording studio Soundtrap scores $6M Series A
147,Steve O'Hear,"Can a chatbot help you manage your money? Three London-based fintech startups are betting on the answer being yes and have jumped aboard the messaging gravy train as they seek to entice millennials to their respective platforms.
The thinking goes something like this: A conversational interface, coupled with tech that plugs into your bank account and analyses your spending in the background, is the best way to deliver financial assistance to help you keep track of your money and actually save for a rainy day.
More broadly these chatbots are targeting  millennials who, they claim, typically aren’t as financially savvy as they could be and who are perfectly comfortable communicating entirely through emoji. I jest, kinda.
Choosing to announce news or fully launch today are Plum, Chip, and Cleo, which is a little awkward. You wait around for a chatbot financial assistant and three arrive at once, said nobody.
Founded by Victor Trokoudes and Alex Michael, who were part of the early teams at TransferWise and Tictail respectively, Plum is billed as the first AI powered Facebook chatbot that enables you to start saving small amounts of money effortlessly. The chatbot connects your current account and Plum’s AI learns your spending habits, allowing it to automatically deposit small amounts of money into your Plum savings account every few days.
In a call with Trokoudes, he told me the idea is that you can “micro save” in a way in which you barely notice. Plum does this by looking at your last 3-12 months spending and predicts how much you can afford to save now and in the future.
He also says that Facebook messenger is an appropriate way to deliver a saving assistant, not only because messaging apps are where Plum’s target users already congregate, but also because Plum is largely a background process. Why ask users to download an app when most of the heavy lifting takes place outside of the Plum UI.
Plum is currently in private Beta in the U.K. and will move to invite-only at the end of October. It has just closed $500,000 in seed funding from 500 Startups’ microfund and a number of angels.
Founded by Simon Rabin and Nick Ustinov, who previously founded Roamer, on the surface Chip is a micro-saving chatbot similar to Plum. The key difference being that Chip has actually launched and has chosen to develop its own iOS and Android chatbot app rather than relying on an existing messaging app like Facebook Messenger.
“We have built Chip to help our friends/peers have a happier and healthier relationship with money,” the startup tells me. “How? Prove they can actually save, and actually afford to save – it’s possible for anyone, whatever you earn, however bad you are with money”.
To achieve this, the Chip bot automatically puts money into your Chip saving account based on what it deems you can afford. It does this by learning your spending habits and running this data through its own AI.
Saving is just the start: I’m told that the big vision for Chip is to be able to offer a range of financial services that are “price transparent and help the customer have a happier and healthier financial life”. Think competition in overdrafts, personal loans, and forex.
That’s a vision echoed by Plum’s Trokoudes, who, borrowing from the TransferWise playbook, sees many slices of the banking pie where more value can be passed directly onto the consumer. You no longer need to be a bank to have access to a customer’s bank account data from which there are a plethora of value-add opportunities.
A graduate of Entrepreneur First, Cleo bills itself as an intelligent assistant for your money. The AI-powered chatbot, which gets its full launch today, lets you interrogate your bank accounts and credit card data and helps you keep track of your spending and hopefully budget better.
“We’re focused on making managing your money really really simple, not roundups or microsavings,” Cleo co-founder and CEO Barnaby Hussey-Yeo tells me. “It’s for people that would rather not spend a couple of hours every week in a spreadsheet trying to manage their cash”.
The startup uses machine learning to help make you smarter with your money and to automate a lot of what Hussey-Yeo describes as the boring stuff, such as categorising transactions or making sense of graphs. “We try to deliver actionable ways to save in 140 characters or less, in realtime using live data,” he adds.
In practice, this ranges from managing subscriptions, optimising your day-to-day spending to finding better financial products. Not dissimilar to Plum and Chip, the bigger picture for Cleo is to offer a full range of banking products using the data you’ve handed over and its algorithms to make sure you’re always getting the best deal.

148,Steve O'Hear,"Just Eat, the online takeout ordering behemoth, has invested in U.K. startup Flypay, which has built a platform to help restaurant and pub chains consolidate their various and disparate technology solutions. The size of the round is £3.5 million and serves as an extension to the company’s previous Series A that saw it pick up £7 million led by media brand TimeOut.
The investment is also described as a “strategic partnership” and sees Just Eat become the latest tech partner on Flypay’s Flyt platform, which lets restaurants and pubs/bars integrate numerous tech and services, from bookings and loyalty, to things like delivery and reviews.
The startup originally focussed on providing a pay-at-table app to let you settle your restaurant bill “waiter-free,” before adding additional services such as order and collect, order at table, pay at bar and customer loyalty features.
However, it has since realised that there is more value in building a technology stack that doesn’t just compete with but integrates many of the tech solutions the hospitality industry already uses.
“For hospitality operators, our new Flyt platform aims to make it significantly easier to innovate around digital commerce, both in terms of integrating technologies across the customer journey… into their own apps, as well as connecting into the biggest aggregator apps and other platforms, such as messaging, voice commerce and who-knows-what’s-next,” Flypay founder and CEO Tom Weaver tells me.
“Our customers are mainstream casual dining and pubs brands.  We currently work with clients like Wahaca, GBK, Jamie’s Italian, Fuller’s, Chilango, and many others.  We’ve just signed one of the most popular restaurant brands in the U.K., to be announced shortly, to create some uniquely different experiences,” he adds.
To that end, Just Eat and Flypay say they plan to collaborate on “digital experiences” for operators across the casual dining sector. This will see Flypay integrating delivery into restaurant and bars’ own apps, powered by Flyt. But that’s just the start.
There’s also plans to offer Just Eat’s customer base access to in-restaurant experiences, and to work together to make it easier for restaurant, pub and bar operators to “adopt and utilise delivery technology”.
Says David Buttress, CEO of Just Eat, in a statement: “Investing in Flypay will enable us to continue to build a seamless experience for consumers who will be able to order, pay, receive customer care and book delivery through the same product. The technology will help us to enhance our offer to casual dining restaurant chains, enabling them to fulfil delivery using Just Eat. The Flyt platform has the potential to transform the digital journey in the casual dining space and we see huge potential in this technology.”",2016-10-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/t-weaver-_-approved-_-24-11-15.jpg?w=738,"flypay,just-eat",Just Eat backs Flypay to help restaurant and pub chains consolidate their tech
149,John Biggs,"If you’re a maker, a hustler, a shaker, or a serial entrepreneur you probably make a lot of websites. There are a number of tools you can use including Bootstrap (please stop using Bootstrap), Squarespace, and a few cool WordPress plugins. Now there’s also Tilda.
Tilda is basically an easy-to-use responsive page builder that costs $15 a month for a standard landing page. Nikita Obukhov, a Russian web designer and owner of the FunkyPunky design studio, created Tilda as an internal tool but wanted to expand into a wider market. He opened the tool up to general users and now you can use it to drag and drop images and text around a page and basically stick something up in seconds.
One of the differentiators is a tool called the Zero Block. Basically its a web editor inside a web editor that lets you manage typography, draw shapes, and even create animations. It’s Tilda’s secret weapon.
“Users build a website from pre-designed blocks. It’s not templates, so it’s quite flexible and users have freedom. On the other hand, these blocks were created by our highly qualified design team so they look good,” said Obukhov.
I built a quick website for a project in about 15 minutes, using a few stock photos and some text. It was up and running moments after I finished and you can easily assign domain names to your creations. It was a very pleasant experience at the very least.
Tilda is self-funded and they have about 4,000 repeat customers.
While you might not be able to escape Bootstrap completely and while $15 per month is still a lot of dosh for a web page Tilda is definitely a tool I’m adding to my hustler/hacker/weirdo/wantrepreneurial arsenal.",2016-10-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_9478.jpg?w=738,"squarespace,wordpress,free-software,software",Tilda is the web design tool for the rest of us
150,Romain Dillet,"Meet Side, a French startup that until recently was called WeSlash. Side is a marketplace for short-term jobs. Companies may need a few extra hands for a few days or weeks, and students may want to work on the side to make a bit of money or gain experience — Side fills this need and raised $1.5 million (€1.3 million) from Connect Ventures, Fly Ventures, Kima Ventures and TheFamily.
“We make it much simpler to seek a job that you’re going to be able to do while studying,” co-founder and CEO Pierre Mugnier told me. “As for companies, we give them access to students who are available and can legally work.”
Think about it as a sort of “staffing-as-a-service” startup. If you have a big product launch coming up or you want to start a newsletter, you may not want to hire someone full time.
And yet, Side isn’t a typical job board or temp agency. Students on Side are freelancers. Companies hire freelancers for a specific job. And Side facilitates all that.
Let’s say you’re a student. Side helps you register to become a self-employed person. After that, Side handles all the administrative tasks — billing clients, collecting payments and paying you. The company also works with Axa for a public liability insurance for all students. The startup takes a 20 percent cut.
More importantly, Side makes sure that you get paid for what you actually do. “Students get paid for every hour of work, not by task,” Mugnier said. “This way, we can protect students so that they don’t work for nothing.”
The typical salary is €15 per hour ($16.74). After Side’s cut, students end up with €12 per hour ($13.39). Many jobs require you to work 5 to 10 hours a week. So you won’t get rich on Side, but it could be an alternative to being a cashier in a supermarket.
A few startups rely on Side to increase their workforce, such as Uber, Doctolib, Deliveroo, Foodora or Drivy. Bigger companies, such as Sodexo or Caisse d’Epargne, also work with Side.
Side is available in France and the U.K; 10,000 students have registered so far, and 300 companies have tried Side. Eventually, Side wants to optimize its platform so a company can start working with a student in 5 minutes.
But the end game is even more ambitious. Right now, many students in Paris deliver food on restaurant delivery platforms, such as Deliveroo and Foodora. Mugnier told me that students should be able to find jobs that are as flexible as becoming a Deliveroo rider, but for all sorts of jobs.

151,Steve O'Hear,"
It sees the Silicon Valley-based investor work with the companies accepted into the program to build and test appropriate growth “hacks,” put better metrics and analytics in place and design a long-term user acquisition strategy.
500 Startups also makes a $200,000 investment in each startup (minus a $50,000 program fee) in return for a negotiated amount of equity. It’s being hosted at hub:raum with sponsorship from Deutsche Telekom.
Noteworthy: This isn’t the first time “Distro Dojo” has set up shop in Europe. The program debuted in London last year, and builds on 500 Startups’ growing presence in the continent, which has seen it make around 140 investments in Europe to date. So, why bring “Distro Dojo” to Berlin, in particular?
“I spent nearly four years working in Berlin’s tech sector and quickly realized there were many opportunities and strengths to its ecosystem,” explains Jess Erickson, program director at 500 Startups.
Specifically, she cites the high-caliber of the local business and technical universities, Germany’s more favorable immigration policies compared to the U.K. and what she says is the city’s ability to attract talented people from all over the world.
“I’ve seen an influx of companies founded in Berlin (as well as exits) and am thrilled that 500 Startups is starting to launch programs into Germany to help accelerate the process,” adds Erickson.
Meanwhile, I asked Matt Lerner, partner at 500 Startups and the person who heads up its London office and leads the European Distro Dojo program, to share any learnings so far.
He tells me that 20 companies have come through the London program and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the hypothesis that there was a need for an accelerator of sorts dedicated to growth marketing has been validated.
“There’s a huge need for someone in the pre-Series A space to help companies learn how to scale. Demand for the program has been really high as word starts to spread about what we do,” he says.
However, one thing that has surprised Learner is that a number of the U.K.’s already established and up-and-coming digital marketers have chosen to join the program.
They include Mat Braddy (former CMO of JustEat) with his startup Rock Pamper Scissors, and Tom Beverley (former head of digital marketing for Fab, OneFineStay, and Confused.com) with his new venture Fy.
This has seen 500 Startups beginning to recruit more companies that already have strong marketing teams that, says Lerner, tend to reap the largest benefit. “We’ve shifted the focus more towards things [like] analytics, usability testing,” he says.
I also asked Lerner if setting up shop in Berlin, rather than London alone, had anything to do with Brexit? “Alas, it was in the books before the fateful vote,” he tells me. “We’ve long been bent on world domination, and Distro Dojos are a good strategy to really get into a market and see the deal flow and the quality of founders and other investors first-hand.”
As for Brexit itself, “we’re watching and hoping,” he says, and notes that 500 Startups is keeping a keen on eye on important startup issues like immigration policy, harmonized fintech regulations across the continent and the free flow of capital and trade.

152,Natasha Lomas,"Art filter photo app Prisma is adding a big new feature to its iOS app in an update landing today: support for videos.
The app, which lets people turn their selfies into cartoonies by using deep learning algorithms to process photos in various graphic styles, quickly surged to millions of downloads in a viral splash after launching this summer. And just as quickly spawning a rash of fast following clones.
As well as creating arty selfies, users of the Prisma iPhone app can now turn snippets of video up to 15 second long into playable animations by selecting one of the nine filter styles currently available — and waiting for the app’s AI algorithms to weave a frame by frame transformation.
Turning a boring shot of a hallway into a moving comic book in a matter of minutes (as per the clip example below).
Videos can be recorded in the app or selected for processing from the camera roll. You’ll need iOS 10 for Prisma video to work, and a little patience as it can take more than a minute to process a clip depending on length, resolution and which model iPhone you’re using.
Android users will have to be more patient — as there’s still no support for video there.
Prisma says it’s planning to add offline photo processing to the Android app first, in “a week or so”, after which co-founder Aram Airapetyan says they’ll “jump on a video development”. “Android is a tough guy,” he adds.
Processing time for Prisma video on iOS is around two mins for the iPhone 6; 55-60 secs for iPhone 6s; and half a minute for iPhone 7, according to Airapetyan, although in my experience videos seemed to finish process a little quicker than that on average.
All processing is done locally on the device so expect your iPhone hardware to heat up a little as you play around with remixing videos as mosaics or Munches or manga-style cartoons.
Next up on Prisma’s iOS to-do list is adding a GIF creator — with looped video touted as coming “very soon”, aka later this month.
Rough round the edges 
Prisma video on iOS is just a beta launch at this stage, with Airapetyan touting improvements in quality coming down the pipe, and an expanded choice of art filters to style clips — adding their intention is to make all Prisma’s photo processing styles available for video, and add some new ones too.
They’re not first to the punch with art filtered video, though — others, such as the startup behind photo processing app PicsArt, got there before them. (In PicsArt’s case siloing video processing into a second standalone app, called Magic Video).
But Airapetyan is dismissive of rivals’ efforts. “We’re faster and better, taking into account the fact that we’re launching videos in beta, as the final quality will be much better,” he argues when asked how Prisma video stacks up against PicsArt’s take.
“We’ll also increase the photo styles’ quality within a couple of weeks,” he adds.
It’s fighting talk, but Prisma is clearly now having to play catch up with the competition, thanks to its early viral success.
At this beta stage the quality of Prisma video also has some rough edges. More polished looking results are possible with Magic Video — although personally I prefer the simpler Prisma interface vs all the toggles and layers available in Magic Video (but if you prefer a greater choice of editing options and tools you’ll likely disagree).
In a quick test of Prisma video ahead of the new feature launch I found results looked a little crude and were less immediately appealing vs Prisma’s art filtered photos — with a tendency towards producing flickery footage.
That said, as with the art photos, different Prisma filters can yield pretty radically different results, some of which look better than others. So you’ll want to spend some time playing around with different styles.
I found there was typically at least one style that looked interesting if not entirely pleasing. So there’s certainly fun to be had here, although perhaps less instant viral potential vs the snap and share gratification of art filtered selfies.
Here are a couple more test clips I made — using the ‘Gold Fish’ and ‘The Scream’ filters respectively:
And here’s a longer form video made by music group Tweed, apparently incorporates Prisma’s tech (although — take note — the app has a hard stop at 15 seconds of video, so you’re not going to be able to create anything as long form yourself using just Prisma, just yet)…
For both video and photos Prisma’s app does not offer as many granular controls for processing as PicsArt’s two apps do. But Prisma’s simplicity is very much part of the viral appeal here IMO. Nor does Prisma require you to register just to process a few photos… But sure, horses for courses — if you want a more fully featured image editing app then Prisma is not it.
Looking purely at the photo filter effects, I also personally prefer Prisma’s results — finding PicsArt’s results generally more garish. But again that’s a matter of personal taste.
Despite — or perhaps because of — its single feature focus, Prisma continues to rack up downloads. It tells TechCrunch it’s now had around 70 million downloads at this point, just over three months after launch.
Back in August it was running at 55M+ downloads — and the app’s early popularity attracted speculation over the summer about whether or not the team would raise VC funding to keep developing or else get snapped up a social platform giant like Instagram or Snapchat keen to beef up its own in-house content creation talent.
In the event, Prisma has done neither. Instead it has started monetizing usage via sponsored styles that are available in the apps.
Currently it has one sponsored filter launched (called Gett), with another slated as coming later this month. And the team does not seem as if it’s about to accept a big outside investment.
“I think we’re ok,” adds Airapetyan, responding to a direct question about whether they’re raising funding. But whether a new kid on the block app with millions of downloads but no social sharing platform of its own, and a bunch of copycats seeking to eat its lunch, can turn a cool feature into a sustainable business remains to be seen.",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/device-comp.png?w=738,"prisma,art-filters,video,picsart","Prisma adds art filtered video, GIFs coming next"
153,Ingrid Lunden,"The Internet of Things — the area of technology where previously dumb objects are getting equipped with radio signals and microprocessors to be connected, monitored, controlled and supercharged through networks — is still in its early days, but one of the more interesting startups in the field is raising some significant money as it gears up to take a leading role in its future.
Sigfox, the startup out of France that is building a global network for connected objects that emit low-power signals, is seeking to raise between $100 million and $200 million, at a valuation of around $600 million, according to sources. The round is likely to be closed by the end of this year, possibly as soon as next month, according to the company’s CEO and co-founder Ludovic Moan.
The news comes at the same time that Sigfox is unveiling an identity rebranding, where it is positioning itself as a network not just for connected objects, but as a provider of connectivity for digital services, specifically seamless and more efficient handoff between different networks, for example.
On top of solving some of the more immediate needs for connecting objects and networks, Sigfox has very lofty ambitions to do even more. The company believes that its architecture, which is not based on the operator’s view of network connectivity, could help eliminate data roaming, the cost and complexity of silicon for connecting objects, and even the need for batteries in devices.
(Sidenote that I promise I am not making up: Moan is a big disciple of the Simulation theory and also believes that his company could play a role in enabling our constructed existence. “[The simulation] is part of the vision that I have, and I want Sigfox to be able to stay true to this,” he said. “This world is virtual. At the end of the day we are not living in the real world.”)
TechCrunch learned of the new financing round and has confirmed the details with sources close to Sigfox and then confirmed it with the company. The round is expected to include at least one strategic investor out of China and “some familiar faces.”
The Chinese investors are of particular interest to Sigfox as it continues to build out its global network. The company is already live in 24 countries — including a 100-city deployment in the U.S. — and plans to bring that to 30 in the near future. Moan — who confirmed the fundraising when I asked him about it directly — also told me that China and India, huge markets for mobile and wireless services, are very much in its sights as a part of that.
To date, Sigfox has disclosed around $150 million in funding with its last valuation at around $400 million. Existing investors include typical financial backers like Elliott Management and Partech Ventures, as well as a long list of strategic investors including utility giants Air Liquide, chip and equipment makers like Intel and Samsung, and a host of service providers like Eutelsat, Japan’s NTT and Telefonica.
The company has made waves in the industry up to now by providing an alternative network and model to the flavor of IoT that is being put forward by carriers. Carriers, of course, are looking to IoT as a route to adding more data traffic to their existing networks. On top of this they are hoping to build out their services businesses to integrate and help run those IoT systems on behalf of other organizations. That makes sense, since the basic data connectivity for connected objects is a low-margin business.
And if IoT is a game of scale, Sigfox is hoping to be the biggest. The company’s pricing starts at €1 per device per month up to €1 per device per year (with a sliding scale based on volume), and it already has over 8 million low-powered devices registered on its network, which covers 1.35 million square kilometers and 358 million people.
It also says that it works with 1,000 partners that include network operators, component manufacturers, integrators and platform developers as part of its business, and that 250 startups are currently developing IoT projects implementing its connectivity. Existing projects include the BT.TN universal button, water management services and connected home initiatives.",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/sigfox-logo.jpg?w=738,,IoT startup Sigfox is raising $100M-$200M at a $600M valuation to grow globally

155,Haje Jan Kamps,"It’s been just over a year since Adobe launched its Adobe Stock photography service, with deep integration into the company’s Creative Cloud suite. Today, it expands the number of photos available with the EyeEm Collection, a hand-picked selection of the best images EyeEm‘s customers have shared and offered for sale on the platform.
That’s good news for people buying images via Creative Cloud, good news for people selling images on EyeEm and great news for EyeEm itself, adding another revenue stream to the existing sales channels to Getty.

Adobe’s Stock collection already included 55 million photos, videos, illustrations and graphics before it started pulling content from EyeEm’s sizable stack of creative stock photography. EyeEm’s collection is sourced from a large number of photographers, often shooting with smartphones. The company says it has more than 80 million images from more than 18 million photographers in its catalog.
“Photographers often don’t even know the value of the images that are sitting on their camera roll on their phone,” Meissner told me earlier this year, around the time when the brand started flexing its computer vision muscles with its launch of The Roll. “The truth is that you don’t have to be a professional photographer to take amazing photos, we are seeing amateur photographers who have never made money from their images in the past doing great on the EyeEm Marketplace!”",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/eyeem-homepage-screenshot-ii.png?w=738,"photography,adobe,eyeem",Adobe teams up with EyeEm to expand its stock photography portfolio
156,Jonathan Lister,"

I’ve recently seen a few examples of services that ask customers to type in their online banking usernames and passwords so the service can access their bank accounts on their behalf. The applications are fairly broad and definitely useful — making payments, ID verification and analyzing data, for example.
This is a security anti-pattern. This is bad news.
Banks regularly email their customers to say they will never ask for your password in an email and that attempts to do so should be reported as phishing. I’m a Metro Bank customer and the footer of each of their emails says:
Phishing is a serious security issue for banks. Industry data suggests that losses from online banking fraud were up 64 percent to £133.5 million in 2015 from £81.4 million in 2014. A Google search for “bank phishing” turns up results from all the major high-street banks, with titles like “Recognising & Preventing Phishing” and “Phishing & email scams.” Barclays has even started producing videos on the subject. So if the industry is, rightly, concerned with educating people about the risks of phishing, why on earth are they happy for their customers to put their login details into any other website than their bank’s website?
I’ve spoken to the service providers about how they are able to offer this service to customers, as my first assumption was that it would be against the terms and conditions of the various online banking services. Having checked a few online banking terms and conditions, customers are not protected against fraud if they have not kept their passwords safe. Lloyds even references information “aggregators” explicitly — Lloyds can close your online banking account if you give your security details to the service provider.
The response from the service providers is interesting — and unnerving.
All the service providers quoted “PSD2,” the revised Directive on Payment Services, a European law that came into force in November 2015. This is timetabled to pass into U.K. law in January 2018 (although Brexit…) and requires that banks open digital access to customers’ bank accounts to other companies. This is a huge deal. One of the people I spoke to about this said that the “banks could see the writing was on the wall with PSD2,” so they did not put up any objection to the service provider taking the username and password of the bank’s customer.
But access is not the only thing PSD2 is meant to promote. Commissioner Jonathan Hill said at the launch of PSD2 that:
Of course, the arrival of PSD2 in early 2018 is providing a stimulus for companies to build services on bank accounts. If early adopters use a method of customer login that is indistinguishable from phishing, the problem that currently looks limited to a handful of services will burst into a million pieces when access to bank accounts is not only encouraged, but legislated for.
When Twitter first took off, it was not uncommon for a new website to ask for your Twitter username and password in order to, say, tweet on your behalf. Back in 2006, Blaine Cook, Twitter’s architect at the time, started working on an alternative that allowed you to grant access to certain information or capabilities, such as tweeting as you, without giving away the keys to your whole account.
What Blaine and his collaborators worked on eventually became the OAuth standard and now powers all the “login with” Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn/Google buttons you see on websites all over the internet.
So why not OAuth for banks? The Open Bank Project advocates for OAuth, but, unfortunately for us U.K. customers, its adoption has been limited so far to German banks (however, this in itself is a great success). The U.K. government commissioned the Open Banking Working Group (OBWG) in late 2015, to explore the question of opening up data held by banks. The OBWG published their findings as the Open Banking Standard in August this year. Happily, they have also recommended the use of OAuth*. The only U.K. bank that has taken up the OAuth gauntlet so far is Monzo.
So the outlook at this point is mixed. The Open Banking Standard is not expected to be implemented in its full glory until 2019, although initial services that only read information are expected in 2017. If you’re reading this as a consumer, be vocal in demanding safe and secure access to your bank account. If you are responsible for building an online product, make a point of not making poor choices for your customers. Between now and 2019, there is still plenty of time for keen fintech startups to open services that train bad habits into people and leave them vulnerable to fraud.
* Technical caveat: There are some credible issues with their choice of the particular version of the standard — Teller.io is being particularly proactive in response.",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/phishing.jpg?w=738,"banking,phishing",Are banks promoting phishing?
157,Steve O'Hear,"Hooks, the app that enables you to get a push notification for things that are important to you — such as news, new film releases or just about anything — has updated its iOS app to make it social by adding live chat to each notification.
“Now anyone who gets the same notification can talk inside Hooks app,” Hooks co-founder and COO Oleg Kozynenko tells me. “We’ve been testing this for the last month and we are getting very good participation numbers.”
So far, so nifty. But why add chat to an app that is otherwise all about private custom notifications? Kozynenko says that with 3 million-plus subscriptions to Hooks topics, the startup is already seeing users clustering around the same interests.
“What’s more important [is] we have their attention at the exact same moment something happens… when they receive a push notification about something they love,” he adds.
This, of course, presents some obvious social moments, such as when your football team scores or a new episode of your favorite TV show airs. Or when I publish my latest article on TechCrunch (I wish!).
It’s also a feature made ever more enticing by not only its immediacy but the way the Hooks UI surfaces how many other people have just received the same notification and are therefore also candidates to join the conversation.
Meanwhile, I’m told that Hooks has raised further funding: a $750,000 round backed by Techstars, KFund, Lanzame, Bankinter and various unnamed angels.",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/unnamed.png?w=738,hooks,Hooks adds chat feature to let you converse around the same push notification
158,Natasha Lomas,"The startup behind a fun, augmented reality tattoo app called InkHunter, covered by TC back in April, is launching its Android app out of beta today — after racking up some 2.5 million downloads on iOS.
They’ve been beta testing on Android, as they worked to ensure their AR tech could handle a range of hardware and slower Android devices, but are launching officially now.
The team is also fleshing out its evolving business model, having spent the summer in the ERA accelerator in New York, relocating to the U.S. from Ukraine.
Their app idea started life as a project cooked up during a 48-hour hackathon back in mid-2014, but the startup is now looking to move beyond being just an app for virtually trying tattoos — eyeing a B2B play, with a plan to license their core augmented reality technology to e-commerce and gaming app makers.
So instead of focusing on building a marketplace for tattoo artists, they’re now working on an SDK for other developers with a particular need for AR-powered product visualization within their own apps and services.
The team intends to continue developing their InkHunter consumer tattoo app, though mostly as a showcase of the AR tech. CEO Oleksandra Rohachova also says they are looking to work with brands to develop branded tattoo campaigns within the app — mostly for “social sharing” potential more than encouraging people to seriously get a company logo inked on their person (although of course people do… ).
“We are going to launch a few campaigns at the end of the year,” she tells TechCrunch.
When it comes to their plan for licensing via an SDK, they’re hoping to have launched to all comers in about a year’s time, after first running trials with select partners — and are aiming to start that this year.
Examples of the sorts of licensing use-cases that could make sense for pen-and-ink-powered virtual try-ons are accessories such as watches and jewelry, reckons CTO Pavlo Razumovskyi. InkHunter’s AR requires users ink three straight lines on themselves where they want to virtually try something — such as a tattoo — which its algorithms use to anchor the result and scale it correctly.
Another possible use-case Razumovskyi mentions is visualizing large items of furniture or electronics in a room. For this scenario, instead of the user drawing on their skin to anchor the AR correctly, he suggests they could use sticky notes positioned in the correct spot in the room where they want a new sofa/TV/table, etc.
“Right now if you want to try an augmented reality in your app… there are two approaches. The first one is basically some printed marker — so you need to print something, or buy something, or get something which the app can recognize. Which makes it almost impossible to spread to a lot of people,” he argues. “I don’t know any successful B2C example of AR based on some printed stuff.
“There are also technologies that don’t use any kind of marker. Pokémon Go uses it. But they’re prone to moving around and are not really stable. So when we developed the tattoo app we figured out how to make stable, not shaky AR — with the ability to spread among users. And our secret sauce is these three lines.
“These markers that people can draw with any kind of pen… On any surface. And in different shapes and the app still recognize that. And can give a stable picture of the end — like tattoos.”
So there you have it: A tech startup that reckons its secret sauce is old-school pen and ink… Who said paper was dead?

The team has just graduated ERA’s demo day and Rohachova says it’s planning to stay in NY, while keeping some of its devs back in Ukraine for costs reasons. At this point they’ve taken in $40,000 in funding from ERA, via its accelerator program, but plan to start raising a seed this year.",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-05-at-11-46-29-am.png?w=738,"ar,inkhunter,augmented-reality","InkHunter’s AR tattoo app exits beta on Android as startup looks to wider, B2B play"
159,Steve O'Hear,"Have we reached peak gig economy yet? Probably not, but when a startup calling itself Gig launches, we are definitely making headway. The London-based company offers a platform targeting millennials who want to pick up shift work in the hospitality and retail sectors.
As well as enabling you to find and book work through the app, Gig’s headline feature is that once a shift is completed, workers automatically get paid within 24 hours.
If the so-called gig economy is fueling an array of services that let consumers purchase things “on-demand,” here Gig is punting employment itself as available on-demand.
“Millennials want instant gratification, they want and get it with travel (Uber), takeaway (Deliveroo) and retail (Amazon same day delivery), but they are yet to get it with work,” says Gig co-founder Antony Woodcock.
“Employment is traditionally the embodiment of all things contrary to the above. It’s structured, you work set shifts or set days, which are planned a week or more in advance and you don’t get paid until the end of the week or month. There isn’t anything instant about that.”
In contrast, there’s no obligation to work a minimum number of days or a minimum number of hours when you sign up to Gig. You simply apply for the shifts that work for you, presuming they are available. “Gig provides instant gratification by paying advances to its users 24 hours after the completion of their shift,” explains Woodcock.
He and his brother Daniel came up with the idea for Gig after they found it difficult to efficiently staff Maki, the sushi restaurant chain they opened last year.
“The traditional set eight-hour shift didn’t fall at the right time for us; our peak hours are lunchtime and around 6pm, therefore, if we had people in for a normal shift then they wouldn’t really have anything to do between the hours of 2pm to 5pm,” he says.
Likewise, it didn’t always work for Maki’s employees who wanted more flexibility. “Many of them were students so they either wanted time off to study or they wanted the shift to be planned around their social lives,” claims Woodcock.
Hence, Gig was born.
To fund its London launch, the startup has raised £1 million. Backers are mostly unnamed private investors, but includes Riaz Ladha, Chairman of Omni Group, a “traditional” recruitment agency and facilities management company operating in the hospitality industry.
In a classic case of semantic hijacking, Ladha says in a statement: “Gone are the days when people want security and longevity. It’s now all about flexibility and immediacy, and Gig serves both on a plate.”
The presumption being, of course, that job security and longevity are one and the same, and that you can’t ditch one without the other.

160,Jon Russell,"Google today announced a collection of updates aimed at helping get ‘the next billion’ internet users in India and emerging markets online. One of the more subtle yet interesting components to that push is the launch of Google Station, a project to enable free public Wi-Fi hotspots, which is now open for new partners.
That strategy kicked off in January of this year when Google introduced free internet on India’s railways through a partnership with state-owned company RailTel that began at Mumbai Central railway station. You might expect free Wi-Fi to be crappy, but those who used it praised the service for being better than many paid-for hotspots across India.
Google, of course, has a vested interest in getting more people online. It makes its money from online advertisers who need an audience, while it benefits from having more people using its services — such as YouTube, which now has a dedicated app for emerging markets — and owning devices running on its Android operating system. Connectivity is the planet’s biggest tech challenge right now, it is the piece of the internet that is missing or broken in many parts of the world where people are coming online for the first time. In India alone, Google estimates that 10,000 people go online for the first time each hour, while in Southeast Asia the figure is 3.8 million per month.
The company made a big push on the free Wi-Fi initiative, and today it revealed that it now covers 50 national stations, providing internet access to 3.5 million people each month. (That’s up from 1.5 million in June.) Google and RailTel are targeting 400 stations nationwide, and, in addition to that, it has now opened the program up to other public organizations.
Google Station is aimed at all manner of public businesses, from malls, to bus stops, city centers, and cafes. And not just those in India, too, Google said.
“We’re just getting started and are looking for a few strategic, forward-thinking partners to work with on this effort,” it added in a statement.
For all the excitement around how Google is disrupting U.S. internet access with Project Fi and Google Fiber, Google Station has the potential to take things even further by giving the hundreds of millions who lack decent quality internet access, a reliable connection to get online regularly for the first time. That is potentially life-changing for many.
No doubt the project is in its early days, but it has the potential to do an incredible amount of good — and hopefully without running into conflicts of interest, as the free internet project from Facebook did.",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screenshot-2016-09-27-18-12-59.png?w=738,"india,connectivity,emerging-markets",Google expands its initiative to provide free Wi-Fi hotspots in emerging markets
161,Jon Russell,"Didi Chuxing, China’s largest ride-hailing company, may be about to get into bicycles. Bike sharing, to be precise. The company, which is in the process of finalizing its acquisition of Uber’s business unit in China, today revealed that it has invested in a young startup called Ofo which lets people borrow bikes.
The investment is said to be “tens of millions” in size, but it isn’t clear how much equity Didi has picked up. Ofo reportedly raised $4 million in investment earlier this month, Didi didn’t specific whether its capital was part of that round or extra to it.
The Chinese firms didn’t say a whole lot actually — as evidenced by Didi’s one paragraph announcement — but they did call the deal part of “a multi-layered partnership.” Didi didn’t respond to our request for further information about what that actually means, and how it plans to work with Ofo.
Reading between the lines, though, the tie-up could give Didi an opportunity to make a foray into cycles, perhaps by providing Ofo as an option inside its app. Beyond offering licensed and private taxi rides, Didi’s services also include chauffeurs, test drives, and a communal bus service. Likewise, if it decides to move into services as Uber and others have done, then an army of students on bicycles could power food deliveries, couriering packages, etc across cities.
Ofo was founded two years ago as part of a startup program at Peking University. It claims to have 70,000 bikes across 20 cities in China, with its 1.5 million registered users taking 500,000 rides per day. Bicycles are hugely popular in China — Beijing alone has nine million, which inspired a pop song — and they are particularly well used by students in the country.
Didi’s other investments follow more obvious strategic lines. In the past, it has put money into Uber rivals Lyft (U.S.), Ola (India) and Grab (Southeast Asia) as part of an alliance of solidarity that includes the sharing of ‘best practices’ and allows customers to roam between different ride-hailing providers as they travel. However, Didi’s acquisition of Uber China threw that alliance into uncertainty since that deal will see the Chinese company become an investor in Uber, while Uber, in turn, will take equity in Didi.",2016-09-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screenshot-2016-09-26-15-59-07.png?w=738,"ride-hailing,china,didi-chuxing",Chinese taxi-hailing giant Didi eyes bicycle sharing with its latest investment
162,Jon Russell,"The company behind iconic music magazine Rolling Stone has sold a 49 percent share in the business to a startup from Singapore in a bid to grow its international reach.
U.S.-based Wenner Media announced the sale of its stake to Singapore’s BandLab this weekend, although the price paid was not disclosed. BandLab is run by Meng Ru Kuok, the 28-year-old son of palm oil billionaire Kuok Khoon Hong, and this isn’t its first piece of notable M&A. In 2012, the company acquired Swee Lee, a distributor of guitars and other instruments, and last week it picked up San Francisco-based instrument design lab Mono. It also offers a free app that lets artists create and share music.
BandLab said it will “focus on expanding Rolling Stone’s business in new markets, and propelling the brand’s global evolution.”
That means the creation of Rolling Stone International, which will manage the newly acquired stake in the business and, Bloomberg reported, develop live events, merchandising and hospitality to extend its brand beyond editorial. (Editorial control, by the way, will not be in BandLab’s remit, the company said.) Rolling Stone already circulates local versions of its magazine in 12 countries.
Rolling Stone claims a readership of nearly 12 million for its print publication and a ‘digital audience’ of more than 65 million online — although that figure appears to include social channels like Facebook, where it claims a cumulative 18 million fans and followers. The company didn’t give figures for Rollingstone.com, instead it said that “average monthly unique visitors to the site [are] up nearly 40 percent” year-on-year. Take that as you will.
This is a significant deal for Wenner since it is the first time it has allowed outside money into Rolling Stone, which is approaching its 50th anniversary.
But these are modern times and they require a modern approach. Kuok, who was in negotiations for 18 months, told Bloomberg that he sees “plenty of synergies” between Rolling Stone and BandLab’s other ventures. It’s certainly a reality in the 21st century that media can’t rely on print or online alone, but it’ll be interesting to see how these threads are tied together.
“We are focused on the consumer and the supply chain of music, and innovative business models around music that exist today. At the end of the day, the end consumer is the same. BandLab’s goal is to be a global music business,” he said.
Already, BandLab has breathed new life into Swee Lee’s 70-year-old business, which has expanded to become a place to find music lessons and buy merchandising as well as instruments.",2016-09-25,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/rolling-stone-1.jpg?w=738,"singapore,wenner-media,rolling-stone",Singapore-based music startup buys 49% stake in Rolling Stone
163,Jon Russell,"Fresh from raising $750 million in new financing this week, Uber rival in Southeast Asia Grab is now making a move into the self-driving car space after it agreed to a partnership with NuTonomy, the MIT spin-out that is developing autonomous vehicles.
NuTonomy gained attention for beating Uber to publicly testing self-driving cars when it switched on a pilot in Singapore in August — just before Uber began tests in Pittsburgh, U.S.. Its agreement with Grab will see it extend that trial by including customers from Grab in the testing phase for an initial two months.
NuTonomy’s pilot is limited to one part of Singapore — a 2.5km square business district area called ‘One North’ that the government designated to testing self-driving cars — but Grab passengers are permitted to go beyond those boundaries and take a trip into nearby neighborhoods. In that case, one of the supervisors overseeing the autonomous vehicle will take the wheel to complete the journey.
Despite raising over $1.3 billion from investors to date, Grab has not focused self-driving cars in the same way as Uber. In fact, the press release for its funding this week made no reference to self-driving cars or autonomous technology. While it is true that the infrastructure in most of the six countries that it serves in Southeast Asia are some way from being able to support the technology, the fact that autonomous vehicles are emerging in Singapore — Grab’s HQ and a market where the government has thrust its weight behind the idea — might be enough to get its attention.

A Grab spokesperson told TechCrunch that the tie-in with NuTonomy does not include an investment in either party, so for now this looks purely like a partnership play. Grab gets to see what state autonomous vehicle technology is at, while NuTonomy gains the benefits of Grab’s tech resources for routing, managing supply/demand, mapping and more.
Grab indicated to us that it has an interest in offering self-driving cars in other parts of Southeast Asia in the long run, but for now Singapore is the primary focus.
“This landmark tech partnership is a step towards supplementing Singapore’s transport network with an innovative driverless commuting option for underserved areas of Singapore — all accessible through the Grab app,” Grab CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan said in a statement.
NuTonomy raised $18 million earlier this year from investors that included the Singapore Economic Development Board. The company is running trials in the UK and U.S. and it hopes to introduce a fully commercial self-driving ‘robo’ taxi fleet by 2018.

We asked Grab a couple of addition questions around the deal.
TechCrunch: Is Grab developing its own self-driving technology outside of this partnership?
Grab: Self-driving vehicles (SDVs) are a nascent technology and concept in Singapore and all around the world. We believe that partnering with NuTonomy, the leading SDV software developer, will enable us to research and refine the SDV user experience, study the application of SDVs in Singapore, as well as improve the efficiency of matching SDVs to passengers.
Grab’s app platform is robust, highly scalable and widely used by commuters in Singapore. We have a strong understanding of Singapore commuter’s travel patterns and behaviors, we have one of the most accurate maps in Singapore that is updated constantly to ensure location accuracy, and we have built a robust fleet routing technology. These are critical components to move SDV from a trial phase into a real-world application. We believe that SDVs are a complementary service and an innovative solution to enhance the efficiency of Singapore’s land transport network, particularly where additional first-mile and last-mile connectivity is needed — as well as in underserved neighborhoods.
Grab and NuTonomy bring complementary skillsets to the table. NuTonomy has proven expertise in building software for self-driving vehicles, while Grab has the know-how in fleet routing technology and localized mapping. By each focusing on our core strengths, we can more effectively create the most robust e-hailing platform for self-driving vehicles.
TC: Are there plans to expand this trial to other countries outside of Singapore in the future?
Grab: Singapore is the ideal test bed for SDVs due to its more advanced infrastructure and strong government support. It will be a longer runway for SDVs to be a viable transport service in other SEA cities, and Grab will continue to offer multiple transport services that meet the local needs of consumers, such as taxis, cars or bikes.",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo-6-lim-kell-jay-head-of-grab-singapore-with-dr-karl-iagnemma-co-founder-ceo-of-nutonomy.jpg?w=738,"singapore,self-driving-cars,nutonomy,grab",Uber rival Grab partners with Nutonomy to test self-driving cars in Singapore
164,Ingrid Lunden,"The automotive industry is in flux with the rise of self-driving and electric cars, and the concept of car ownership altogether being thrown into question. With this, the car insurance industry is changing, too, and now, an on-demand car insurance startup has raised a large round of funding as it aims to be leader of that change.
Metromile, the provider that lets you pay-per-mile for insurance, said that it has raised a whopping $191.5 million in funding — “primarily equity”, according to CEO Dan Preston. Metromile will use the money to acquire an insurance carrier called Mosaic Insurance to handle the underwriting of its policies itself; as well as to expand new states in the U.S. and continue building its platform.
Preston declined to disclose the company’s valuation with its latest round.
As notable as the size of Metromile’s funding is the list of investors behind it. They include a couple of insurance giants, Canada’s Intact Financial and China Pacific Insurance (CPIC); top VCs Index Ventures, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), First Round Capital, Mitsui and SV Angel; Metromile founder and Chairman David Friedberg (of Climate Corporation fame); and Mark Cuban.
The funding is a surprising and large boost for a company that has been around since 2011 but has seemingly only raised $14 million before now. (And to be clear, the $191.5 million being announced today is actually three rounds rolled into one. CEO Dan Preston tells me it includes a Series D funding of $103.1 million; an additional strategic investment of $50 million from China Pacific Insurance; and a Series C financing from late 2014 that was never made public, of $38.4 million.)
In the interim, Metromile has acquired licenses to operate in all 50 U.S. states although it’s currently only underwriting policies in four: New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia. With the funding, that underwriting will expand to California, Illinois and Washington, and beyond.
“We will start accelerating our state roll out at the beginning of 2017,” Preston said. “For the time being, our focus is on the huge opportunity for per-mile insurance in the US but we’re excited about exploring global opportunities with partners in the future.”
Metromile sells its insurance directly to those who will be using it, but one of the big ways that it can acquire those users is through alliances with others. So far there has been only one of these, with the ridesharing behemoth Uber, which partnered with the startup in 2015 to provide an option for insurance coverage for those times when you are not carrying a passenger (which falls under a different insurance scheme).
Preston says that it’s continuing to work with Uber and the change over to Metromile underwriting all of its own insurance — a result of the Mosaic acquisition — will not impact Uber drivers “for the time being.”
“We are focused on moving our personal business over first. The new claims experience is currently only available for Metromile’s personal policies,” he said. “Uber driver-partner policies will continue to be underwritten by insurers in the National General Insurance Group and their coverage will not be compromised in any way.”
Metromile has carved out a reputation for disrupting some of the more obvious inefficiencies of the standard insurance business model and the pricing that has been developed around it.
“Sixty-five percent of drivers pay higher premiums to subsidize the minority who drive the most,” Preston explained. The cases where this is perhaps most acute are in cities where people are not entirely dependent to their cars. “Our go to market strategy is focused on large urban areas and aimed at developing a brand with each city that we roll out into. The people who switch to pay-per-mile insurance commute differently. They take multiple forms of public transit, walk, bike or even ride-share to work so a usage based option makes more sense to them.”
While Metromile is tapping into some of the bigger changes that are taking place in the world of transportation, taking on traditional big providers like Geico, Progressive and State Farm, it’s not the only one. There are many of other companies offering pay-as-you-go car insurance right now, including those same huge insurance conglomerates through to startups (some of which have closed due to competition from the large players).
Preston says that the others are different because they use other instruments to measure a driver’s actions to provide a rate.
“What many people call pay as you go insurance is actually behavioral based insurance,” he said. “Metromile is the only multi-state per-mile insurance product and does not rate based on behavior other than miles driven.” Metromile’s model reduces insurance costs for low-mileage drivers by charging based on actual usage of the vehicle. It does this by way of a small wireless device called the Metromile Pulse, which plugs into the diagnostic port of the insured’s vehicle to count the number of miles driven. Drivers are then billed a base rate and a per-mile rate. The company claims that its typical, low-mileage customer can save, on average, $500 per year on insurance.
Preston adds that Metromile’s second differentiator is down to “urbanization and a shifting mindset of millennials.” By this, he means that the less frequent and less regular use of cars by these groups makes per-mile services — which would otherwise work out to be very expensive for more habitual drivers — more appealing.
The third factor that drives users to Metromile is the company’s app. Similar to how many other startups have disrupted their incumbent predecessors, Metromile provides a mobile experience that lets users see and track just how much they are using the insurance and how much they will need to pay. It also has other features like vehicle location, travel data and more.
The changing landscape for transportation will potentially present new opportunities for Metromile in the future.
One area is in connected cars, where you could imagine Metromile being integrated as a built-in option by the automakers: “We have not yet announced any integrations with connected car companies, but are extremely excited about the opportunity,” he told me when I asked about potential partnerships.
Similarly, autonomous and shared-ownership cars — areas that companies like GM, with its Maven initiative, are investing a lot of effort these days — are also targets.
“With multiple types of mixed-use vehicles and autonomous cars, the nature of insurance risk modeling is going to change and insurance companies should aim to adapt to it,” Preston said. “From a consumer perspective, car ownership will continue to be important for people in the US for many years. That said, commuting miles will change because of better public transportation infrastructure and more transportation options which is why pay-per-mile insurance is an important option.”
As we’ve seen in other industries, while Metromile may potentially cut into the business of large insurance companies, it’s also attracting these same competitors as strategic investors, who invest as a hedge against their own existing business.
“Metromile is a proven leader in usage-based insurance technology,” said CPIC in a statement. “Our relationship with Metromile gives us the opportunity to more closely understand the pay-as-you-drive model, allowing us to create more innovative products and a better service experience for the younger and digitalized generation of the future.”
“Our goal, in partnering with Metromile, was to build a relationship that would allow both organizations to strengthen their core competencies in order to enhance the customer experience,” said Karim Hirji, Senior Vice-President, International & Ventures, Intact Financial Corporation, in a statement. “We look forward to this ongoing collaboration as Metromile redefines the marketplace with its unique business model, innovations and smart technology offerings.”",2016-09-21,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/shutterstock_109501475.jpg?w=738,"car-insurance,cars,insurance,metromile","Pay-per-mile insurance startup Metromile raises $191.5M, acquires Mosaic Insurance"
165,Jon Russell,"DailyRounds, a service for doctors that combines elements of a social network and a medical journal, has landed undisclosed funding led by venture capital giant Accel. Beenos, Powerhouse Ventures and Aksua Holdings are participated in the deal, which follows a $500,000 seed round raised last year.
Two-year-old DailyRounds, which is based in Bengaluru and graduated both the GSF India and Microsoft Ventures accelerator programs, is inspired — perhaps strangely — by Stack Overflow.
Yes, it is a tool for developers, but DailyRounds founder Dr Deepu Sebin told TechCrunch that he was taken by the way engineers use the site to communicate about their work and challenges after finding out about it through a tech project. Once he learned more, Sebin saw the potential for a similar service in the field of medicine.
Like Stackoverflow, DailyRounds aims to be a place where doctors can seek advice from others in their field. It is available on desktop, iOS and Android and lets doctors keep in touch with each other, exchange best practices and tips, access a drug database, and upload and view medical case files.
“Initially, it was a few of us [doctors] putting our case studies out there,” Sebin said in an interview. “The site got good traction and we decided to make it into a community. We then raised an angel round and things got interesting.”
Basic idea proven, Sebin then teamed up with computer science graduates Nimmi Cherian and Priyaank Choubey to get the company going.
Today, DailyRounds claims 250,000 users, of which “a very significant” number have been verified as doctors. Verification is based on community feedback to responses, but relevant certificates and ID are requested to prove expertise in some cases.
Around 60 percent of the total number of users are based in India. That’s important for a number of reasons, Sebin explained, including the need for localization in medical practices.
“Physicians in India have traditionally been dependent on the U.S. for information. If you are bitten by a dog, for example, the treatment and medicines can be very different in either country,” he explained.

By uniting doctors in India and providing information such as locally available drugs, Sebin believes that DailyRounds can make a real difference. But it isn’t just having an impact in India, the U.S. is the second largest country for users behind India, and DailyRounds is making a big push to become more relevant for doctors based in the West following this funding round.
“India has been our target so far and we have a strong foothold there, but we plan to explore and expand primarily in the U.S.. We’re seeing interesting activity there but haven’t done much so far,” Sebin said.
“Most [existing] U.S. channels [for doctors] are already editorial, there’s not much of a two-way engagement, doctor-to-doctor,” he added.
The company may also look at localization potential in Europe and Southeast Asia, too. It is also considering the introduction of new specialist apps. Right now, it offers its core DailyRounds app and standalone apps for radiology, cardiology and pediatric professionals.
“We call everyone doctors but when it comes to the practicality we all behave differently,” Subin explained.
Beyond connecting the community, DailyRounds is also showing potential as a channel to reach doctors directly. For example, a WHO guideline on treating TB reached 80,000 users in one day thanks to a notification inside the app.
“Nearly 30 percent of those doctors read the notification inside an hour,” Subin, who previously practiced as a doctor in rural India for three years, added. “Usually it takes time to reach doctors.”
That potential as a channel is an area where Subin believes DailyRound’s monetization lies, but not in the form of adverts. He believes that instead connecting supplies with doctors, perhaps to pilot new product or providing customer support for medical representative solutions, can add value for both sides. DailyRound would take a cut or free for facilitating the connection, but exact terms are still to be finalized.
“We hope not to put direct advertisements and marketing into the service, that won’t be our business,” he added. “When you build a company, [advertising] shouldn’t be the first focus.”
This new funding will give the company — which has 11 qualified doctors on staff — up to two years of funding, Subin said.",2016-09-21,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dailyrounds.jpg?w=738,"powerhouse-ventures,accel",DailyRounds is a social network/medical journal for doctors
166,Devin Coldewey,"North Korea is famously secretive and restrictive — the regime goes to great lengths to both prevent the outside world from learning what goes on there and prevent its citizens from learning about the outside world. An IT error just gave us a glimpse at the country’s online ecosystem — and it’s a pretty meager one.
Late last night (Pacific time, anyway), Uber app security engineer Matthew Bryant noticed that North Korea had set itself to allow domain administrators to request a list of its national top-level domains. Bryant had set up a script to watch for this kind of thing — he wasn’t just sitting there hitting refresh.
The list was automatically copied over, and Bryant put it online on GitHub. It didn’t take long, either: There are a whopping 28 .KP domains registered. (And no, you can’t get your own.)

The Technology subreddit got wind of this and collected screenshots of the sites. Some English-translated ones can be seen here, and mod Jabberminor collected more in the original thread.
This isn’t the limit of what North Koreans, or at least those with internet access, can see from inside the borders, but it is an interesting look at the few websites being administrated within the country. That there are so few, and that those few are so inundated with propaganda, is certainly indicative of the government’s ongoing exertion of strict control over internet-based communication and business.
Don’t be surprised if the live sites are a little slow to respond — being on the front page of Reddit will do that.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/1sbwqj7.jpg?w=738,"top-level-domains,domains,censorship,north-korea",North Korea accidentally lets slip all its .KP domains — and there aren’t many
167,Jon Russell,"Grab, the largest company rivaling Uber in Southeast Asia, has confirmed that it has raised $750 million in fresh capital.
This is the company’s Series F round, and it was led by existing investor SoftBank with participation from undisclosed existing and new backers, Grab said. One of those is almost certain to be China’s Didi Kuaidi, which reportedly made a commitment to this round, but neither side is confirming that right now.
A source close to the company confirmed that the round gives Grab a $3 billion post-money valuation. That’s consistent with our previous reporting, which pegged Grab’s pre-money valuation at $2.3 billion.
Grab operates in six countries in Southeast Asia and its previous raise was $350 million in August 2015. This new financing has been sometime coming, and it was reported that Grab was raising upwards of $600 million in August, with some media suggesting the total could reach $1 billion. That hasn’t happened but Singapore-headquartered Grab did claim that it has over $1 billion on its balance sheet courtesy of this new raise.
Grab said it 400,000 drivers on its platforms and it has seen over 21 million app downloads to date. In an announcement, the company added that it sees “up to 1.5 million daily bookings,” which a Grab spokesperson confirmed means ride requests not completed rides. Uber doesn’t provide business data for Southeast Asia so it is hard to compare them, but we previously reported that Uber is operationally profitable in parts of Southeast Asia and there seems to be little to choose between the two.
An arsenal of capital is clearly necessary when you are taking on Uber, but Grab did sketch out some areas of priority that it will focus on.
Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country and the largest economy in Southeast Asia, is top of its list. Grab CEO Anthony Tan said in a statement that he believes that Indonesia’s ride-hailing industry is worth $15 billion annually — that goes beyond taxi and cars and into motorbike taxis — which Grab offers there — and services such as food delivery, logistics, and more. Indonesia is no easy market and, alongside Uber, Grab is rivaled by GoJek, a motorbike taxi on-demand service that recently raised $550 million at a valuation of $1.3 billion.
Beyond a push into services, Grab is also looking to expand its ecosystem into payments. This summer it announced plans to make its in-app payment system — GrabPay — available to third-party services, and this new funding will go towards making that happen. The GrabPay push will initially focus on Indonesia, where Grab has partnered with national bank Mandiri, but it will also be extended into the company’s other focus markets, too.
Another more obvious area of focus is technology. Grab has R&D centers in Singapore, Beijing and Seattle and its priorities include refining its algorithm to help drivers become more efficient, building out its mapping data and technology, working on demand prediction and user targeting. Grab is also looking to add pooling to its existing vehicle categories, having launched its first pool option in Singapore nearly one year ago.
There’s no word on autonomous vehicles, however, which Uber is testing in Pittsburgh with a view to rolling out more fully. Self-driving cars aren’t just for the U.S. market though. Nutonomy is running testing in Singapore so you could argue Grab is already playing catchup or might need to get its checkbook out if it wants to enter the race.
“Grab has grown tremendously over the past year. This round of funding shows the confidence and optimism investors have in Grab’s market leadership and long-term potential in Southeast Asia,” Tan, Grab’s CEO, said in a statement.
“We are blessed to have great partners like SoftBank, many of whom have unparalleled track records of investing in leading internet businesses in emerging markets, and seeing those companies through to become the core of internet ecosystems in each market,” he added.
Despite much to be bullish about, Grab is up against a tough rival in Uber and in a market that shows little sign of profitability right now. We previously reported that the company was burning as much as $30 million per month in 2015. While Grab has consistently claimed that it has not touched its Series E round yet, it is looking at a long path to profitability in Southeast Asia. Likewise, Didi’s move to acquire Uber China — and, in doing so, take equity in Uber Global — throws questions on its global alliance with Uber’s other rival companies.
Nonetheless, this new funding is a major milestone for Grab, and the largest raise for a tech startup in Southeast Asia to date.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/grab_logo.jpg?w=738,"ride-hailing,southeast-asia,softbank,grab",Uber rival Grab raises $750M led by SoftBank at a $3B valuation
168,Yoni Argaman,"

For those of us in the mobile advertising technology business, China is one of the most exciting markets in the world in 2016. To say that the mobile ad economy in China is a few years behind the U.S. and Europe is both true and an oversimplification.
When you spend time on the ground in China, as I just did a few weeks ago, meeting with over 20 mobile publishers, including titans like Baidu, Qihoo360 and Cheetah Mobile and rising players like Kika, MobiMagic, 6Waves, WeShare, iHandy and Apus, a few things become clear.
One, China’s digital ecosystem is mobile-first and app-first in a way that has leapfrogged the West. Two, while there are similarities in how Western mobile advertising markets have evolved, especially the dominance of a few giants, there are unique dynamics in China that are creating exciting opportunities right now. Three, the firms that will win in China need to be truly global in their approach and capabilities. Below are some of the major themes to look at.
Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba dominate the market 
According to eMarketer analyst Shellene Shum, these three firms will garner 72.8 percent of China’s mobile internet ad market in 2016. That’s huge, and not unlike the dominant market share that Facebook and Google enjoy in the U.S.
With “BAT” controlling so much of China’s traffic, lesser publishers have gone outside of China to acquire and monetize high value users. App developers like video sharing app musical.ly sometimes ignore the Chinese market altogether and go to the ‘overseas’ market first, sometimes even to the U.S. and Europe first.
Domestic user acquisition is complex and challenging
Acquiring users in China is done in two major ways: optimization across the very fragmented Chinese app store ecosystem and pre-installs. While the top three app stores in China are owned by the giants — Baidu, Tencent and Qihoo360 — there is a new generation of app stores owned by large device manufacturers such as Huawei and Xiaomi as well as one by a union of mid-size device manufacturers.
Other than acquiring users through the various app stores, some of the publishers that we met have relationships with device manufacturers and their apps are pre-installed on the devices.
The rise of large middle-market players
Over the last five years, startups have raised massive amounts of VC money and much of these funds have been spent on user acquisition. This has resulted in new giants being formed almost overnight.
One example is Apus, an Android launcher company that we met that was founded in July 2014 and boasts over 900 million downloads, with users from U.S. and Europe accounting for 30 percent of the total user base. As VC and PE funding slows down and bank credit tightens, Chinese publishers, many of which did not generate revenue since their launch, now have to start monetizing traffic.
Chinese publishers focus on utilities and games
Chinese publishers, especially the ones who are aiming at international users, are focusing on utilities (keyboards, flashlights, speed boosters, battery optimizers, etc.), messaging/communication and gaming apps. Chinese utilities app developers realize that they have limited growth opportunities.
They are now trying to get into the content (an area they avoided until recently, realizing that they have no advantage when it comes to Western users) and especially gaming spaces where users spend more time than in utility apps. Android launchers — essentially customized home screen replacements — are on the rise, especially a new generation that includes heavy personalization options and personal assistants.
The Chinese mobile adtech ecosystem has evolved rapidly
Programmatic is very developed and there are many local non-BAT DSPs, SSPs, and exchanges that trade via RTB such as PapayaMobile, Yeahmobi, Mobvista and Avazu. Advanced formats such as video and especially native are on the rise, as well as the user of user data for targeting, despite data being a sensitive issue in China.
Opportunity in monetizing international traffic
Chinese publishers’ overseas traffic typically comes mostly from Southeast Asia, but they are now moving aggressively to establish themselves in the U.S. and European markets. Western traffic is particularly attractive because the CPM rates are usually 10 to 20X higher than that of Southeast Asia. For those that have significant international traffic, monetizing this supply is a large immediate opportunity and one where savvy international firms can quickly establish a foothold in China.

However, we believe that as these “new giants” continue to emerge, they can benefit from someone who can provide a more complex, customized solution with greater capability in higher value ad formats like native and video, advanced programmatic environments like private marketplaces and preferred deals and the addition of data parameters as a way to maximize eCPM, fill rates, viewability, and ad safety.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/china-ios-malware1.png?w=738,"huawei,china,asia",Analyzing China’s mobile advertising technology market
169,Jon Russell,"Payment enabler Stripe has kicked off its expansion into Asia after its service went live in Singapore today.
Stripe is officially entering Singapore today, but the service has been available in beta in the country for nearly one year. It makes sense that the U.S. company, which is valued at $5 billion and backed by the likes of Visa, has targeted Singapore first. Despite a small population of just over five million people, it is a global financial hub that is home to almost all of Southeast Asia’s key startups not to mention that it is the regional headquarters for international firms like Facebook, Twitter and Google.
And Stripe is claiming to have gotten off to a good start. The company said that two-thirds of companies backed by venture capital firms in Singapore are using its service. Some names mentioned today include Uber rival Grab, property listing firm 99.co, and Kickstarter, which recently moved into Asia.
Stripe isn’t saying too much about its specific plans for Asia going forward. It is already present in Australia — which is part of ‘Asia Pacific’ — and it is currently running betas programs in Hong Kong and Japan.
“Asia will be a prime focus for us over the coming year. We’re currently in beta in Japan and Hong Kong with plans to launch soon, and are hiring across our offices in Asia-Pacific to support our growth in the region,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.
For all its apparent traction, Stripe does have some limitations in Asia. For one thing, credit card penetration is below 10 percent in some markets and cash remains a popular payment option, even for online goods. Stripe only caters to card owners which, for now, leaves the door open to companies like Omise, which recently raised $17.5 million, and Coda, which just raised $2 million, which enable online retailers to accept alternative payments.
Asia has vast potential, but there are many intricacies involved.
India, for example, has a population of over a billion, but digital access and online payments remain low and nascent. Google recently switched on carrier billing as a way to help many Indians pay for content, while Uber has embraced cash payments to help fulfill its potential in emerging markets.
Then there’s Southeast Asia, which has a cumulative population of over 600 million and a digital economy tipped to reach $200 billion per year by 2020. However, that potential is spread across six key countries, each of which requires a very local approach and team. It remains to be seen if Stripe will take a bite into that and challenge the local players.
For now, it looks like it is taking on more obvious countries like Japan and Hong Kong, but it may have to adjust its expectations and makes changes to its business if it wants to truly tap the potential of Asia.
Stripe does have its Atlas program that helps foreign companies register as U.S.-based entities to use its services, but that isn’t going to shift consumer trends in emerging markets, which is what is challenging the online payment industry right now.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/fullsizerender1.jpg?w=738,"southeast-asia,singapore,stripe",Stripe enters Asia with its official launch in Singapore
170,Jon Russell,"After more than a year of hinting, Spotify is finally coming to Japan this month. The Swedish music streaming service will go live in the country before the end of September, a source at the company confirmed to TechCrunch.
The Nikkei earlier this summer reported that the launch was imminent. The publication, one of Japan’s leading business publications, said that Spotify Premium would cost around 1,000 yen (close to $10) per month, and that’s the same price range we have heard.
This launch in Japan, the planet’s second largest music market based on sales, has been a long time coming for Spotify, which recently passed 40 million paying customers. Last October — yes, nearly one year ago — we reported that the company was increasing its focus on Asia with plans to land in Indonesia and Japan. That Indonesia expansion happened in March of this year, and Spotify has been focused on bringing its service online in Japan since then.
Spotify’s Tokyo office has been open for 18 months but it has been hiring in the country for two years. Yet, it has sat back and watched as others have beaten it to the punch in Japan. Messaging service Line, which went public earlier this year and has nearly 70 million users in Japan, launched a music streaming service in Japan last year, while Apple, Google and even domestic e-commerce giant Rakuten have piled in with rival services.
Spotify has certainly taken its time building out a team in Tokyo — it is currently hiring for nine other positions — but there is some logic behind the delay. Japanese consumers still prefer to buy CDs and there’s plenty of resistance to streaming and other online models from record labels. But, with annual music sales estimated at nearly $3 billion, Japan is a market that streaming companies hope can become equally as lucrative for them. That’s particularly important for Spotify given rumors of a public listing in the not too distant future.
Spotify has brokered deals with labels in Japan — and even hired staff from them — and it’ll be banking that the competition, which haven’t exactly set the world on fire there yet, have created early demand for streaming which it can piggyback on. Now, with anything up to a half a dozen notable streaming services available to consumers, Japan’s music industry is beginning its transition to digital.
As for Spotify’s next move in Asia: we reported back in March that it was casting its eye on India, and the country could well be its next target. However, we understand that there’s been no solid commitment on that from Spotify yet. Nevertheless, given the slow speed at which it has expanded in Asia, we don’t expect to see a move into India — or other new markets in Asia, for that matter — for some time.
Spotify first entered Asia in 2013 and it is currently available in five countries in the continent: Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.",2016-09-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/spotify-ios.jpg?w=738,"streaming,music-streaming,japan",Spotify will launch its streaming service in Japan this month
171,Jon Russell,"There’s another round of funding for an artificial intelligence startup in Asia that’s focused on e-commerce. Fresh from a Sequoia-led investment in Mad Street Den last month, now Singapore-based ViSenze has announced a $10.5 million Series B raise.
Existing investor Rakuten Ventures led the round alongside WI Harper Group and Enspire Capital. A number of other investors also participated, including SPH Media Fund, FengHe Fund Management, Raffles Venture Partners, Phillip Private Equity, and UOB Venture Management. The startup was spun out of the National University of Singapore more than three years ago and it raised a $3.5 million Series A in February 2014.
ViSenze develops artificial intelligence for use in e-commerce, working with companies like Myntra in India and Zalora in Southeast Asia. Its first product was a visual search feature, and there are two new releases coming soon that will expand its focus to video and help retailers with off-site discovery, ViSenze CEO and co-founder Oliver Tan told TechCrunch.
“We believe shopping behavior is very inspired by enriched content in the social web and media space,” Tan said in an interview. “If we can find interesting connections and help leverage content that inspires shopping behavior, then that can drive more engagement and conversions.”
Currently being tested in closed pilots, one of the new products will enable contextual advertising inside and around video content. That’s to say that content owners will be able to insert relevant advertising into their videos, while advertisers will be able to contextualize their web advertising by making it relevant to the videos that they appear against or near. Global video site Viki, which is owned by Rakuten, is one partner — you can imagine that fashion-based advertising would resonate well against Korean dramas, one segment of programming that Viki is known for. So, for example, a Korean drama could include in-video ads for outfits worn by the cast, with links out to e-commerce stores that sell them.
The other new feature will enable image to text. That will allow for more customizable searches from image uploads, for one thing. Currently, shoppers can upload a screenshot to find related products in an e-commerce site, but the image to text feature would enable them to customize their search for easily. That could mean selecting a different color, shorter/longer sleeves, etc.
More wider, Tan said that the funding will be used for hiring — he expects to “easily” double the current headcount of 40 before this year is out — and to “double down on R&D and innovate further.”
“The funding will accelerate our go-to-market strategy, and a large part will be re-invested in our tech,” he added.
In addition, ViSenze intends to grow its offices in New Delhi, India, and San Francisco, which are primarily for business development, and open similar outputs in the UK and China. Tan said he is spending increased time in the U.S., where he believes there’s a heightened level of understanding around the benefits of AI and the importance of visual search for commerce.
“It’s a very different market from Asia with different levels of sophistication. Many people [in the U.S. retail space] just get us right away,” he explained.",2016-09-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/visenze.jpeg?w=738,"artificial-intelligence,rakuten-ventures,singapore,visenze",Singapore’s ViSenze raises $10.5M to bring the benefits of AI to e-commerce
172,Ingrid Lunden,"Hundreds of millions of dollars of investment have been put into commerce startups in the fast-growing market of India, from marketplaces like Flipkart and Snapdeal through to payment startups like PayTM. Now one of the more interesting of these has been acquired. PayU, an online payments company with a focus on developing markets that is owned by South Africa’s Naspers, has acquired India’s Citrus Pay for $130 million in cash, in what the companies say is the largest cash exit for a payments company in India to date.
The deal, which will close in Q3, will create a larger footprint for PayU in India with over 30 million customers and projected to process 150 million transactions in 2016 worth $4.2 billion. Today, both companies offer digital wallet services — essentially a way of topping up and spending money online and on mobile for people who may not have payment cards — and payment services for online and in-store merchants. The combined company will use this to compete better with others like PayTM, which is the largest payments and mobile wallet provider in the country.
Notably, PayTM is in the process of raising $300 million at a $4.8 billion valuation. So far it has locked down $60 million and sources at the company tell us it expects the remainder of that to close in coming weeks.
It’s a much smaller sum but still a good exit for Citrus Pay, which had raised around $32 million from investors that include Sequoia, Ascent Capital and eContext.
PayU itself got its start in India but is now active across 16 markets as Naspers — which both makes strategic startup investments (including in India) and acquisitions to augment its own media and digital business — used its acquisition of PayU in 2014 to consolidate its payments businesses across several other markets.
Citrus Pay and PayU today cover a lot of the same kinds of services, but it looks like the combined operation will be a lever to expand into more offering around banking and other services. Like PayTM and rival services from e-commerce giants like FlipKart and Snapdeal as well as other big global players like PayPal, all of these companies are tapping into the fact that there is low credit card and bank account penetration in the country, and yet the appetite to buy things online and in person is growing, thanks to an expanding middle class and the growth of smartphone penetration to make transactions.
Boston Consulting Group estimates that digital transactions will hit $500 billion by 2020, representing tenfold growth in the next four years.
As part of the deal, Amrish Rau, Citrus Pay MD, becomes CEO of PayU in India reporting to PayU Global CEO, Laurent le Moal. PayU cofounder Shailaz Nag will focus on new services and bank partnerships; Citrus Pay founder Jitendra Gupta will head up the merged company’s credit business (currently called LazyPay at Citrus). Meanwhile the other PayU cofounder Nitin Gupta, will help with the transition before leaving PayU.
“Today’s announcement is a significant milestone for both businesses, as well as the fintech industry in India,” said Laurent le Moal, CEO of PayU. “It is exciting for everyone across the PayU and Citrus teams as we bring together new capabilities that will help us to better serve our collective clients.”",2016-09-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/shutterstock_297416876.jpg?w=738,,Naspers’ PayU buys Citrus Pay for $130M in cash to expand in India
173,Ingrid Lunden,"As LinkedIn continues to wait for the close of its $26.2 billion acquisition by Microsoft, it continues to build out its business, with the latest developments on the international front. Last week, LinkedIn announced that it had hit 100 million users in Asia Pacific (around one-quarter of its total), and today at an event in Bengaluru, India, it unveiled three new products it’s rolling out in India, where it has 37 million users, that it hopes will now get them (and others) using the site more.
LinkedIn Lite is a new pared-down mobile version of LinkedIn that is designed to work on lower-end handsets and those that are accessing the site with limited or very expensive mobile data services. It will be rolling out in the next couple of weeks, a spokesperson tells me.
Meanwhile, the company has also launched a service called LinkedIn Placements to provide an online test for users and help place them in jobs. And for businesses, it’s launched LinkedIn Starter Pack to set up and run their profiles on the social platform.
LinkedIn Lite. Today at the event in Delhi, CEO Jeff Weiner said that LinkedIn Lite would be rolling out to users in the country in the next few months. As with other “lite” versions made for mobile, LinkedIn’s service does away with things like extra graphics and rich media to download four times faster than LinkedIn’s basic mobile site. The company claims the homepage only takes up 150 KB of data, and further pages 70 KB.
From the looks of the screenshots here, it appears the Lite version may simply be turned on by default in situations where bandwidth might be tight: as you can see the URL is LinkedIn’s basic linkedin.com.
LinkedIn Lite is a late entrant into a market that has seen a number of other attempts to grow usage numbers in India by meeting their mobile data demands: while the vast majority of people in India (which is the world’s second largest smartphone market after China) use mobile phones rather than PCs to access the internet, more generally data is very expensive for the average user, and connectivity is not as fast.
Facebook has been offering pared-down versions of its own social network for years now aimed at developing markets. They include Facebook Lite, an Android app launched in 2015. And Zero, a text-only version introduced in 2010. Controversially, it’s also worked with carriers to launch free versions of its site, too, under the Basics brand: many complained, however, that the service violated net neutrality rules and it eventually got shut down in India. Twitter has also worked on ways of developing its own lighter versions and specific services for markets like India.
LinkedIn Placements. While Lite is designed to get people using LinkedIn more on a daily basis, Placements is a service aimed at making LinkedIn more practical and useful for them.
Here, LinkedIn has partnered with HackerRank, as well as Aspiring Minds, Co-cubes and Wheebox, to develop an online test for users to show off their skills and interests, which are then matched up with a number of jobs being advertised on the site. You then proceed with the usual job finding process that involves interviews, references and more. There are some 50 jobs already up for Placements through the scheme in areas like software development, marketing and finance. (The emphasis initially seems to be software: HackerRank, which powers the first test, specialises in engineering and programming skills tests.)

Placements is an interesting development that touches several parts of LinkedIn’s bigger business strategy. The company has been moving very aggressively into online education services, spearheaded perhaps most obviously with its acquisition of Lynda.com, and this is an interesting development that ties in another way of using the online testing format to help boost another part of LinkedIn’s business.
That other part, of course, is recruitment advertising, which today is the company’s biggest revenue driver. Right now, while LinkedIn is spreading the word about the Placement service to would-be jobseekers, it’s also encouraging businesses to place their ads on the platform to match up those people with positions.
In a market that may have a lot of self-taught programmers and others, it provides one way of trying to circumvent the normal course of students graduating from a particular university, or otherwise be overlooked in the job market. This also potentially gives LinkedIn a more central place in how it believes its platform can influence what Weiner has described as the “economic graph” of our society.
The other area where Placements will help LinkedIn’s bigger business is in getting more users to give it more information. Part of the scheme involves updating and filling out your own profile on the site before you take the online test, which will give LinkedIn a new opportunity to pick up fresh and accurate data about you.
Starter Pack. The last of these is less obvious for consumer users but is an interesting compendium to how LinkedIn hopes to grow its profile as a directory for businesses online, and potentially develop those relationships, too. The promise for the companies that build profiles on LinkedIn’s platform is that they can market themselves better: “Grow your Brand. Grow your Team. Grow your Influence,” is how LinkedIn describes it. More practically, it will give LinkedIn an avenue to court these companies for more recruitment and other ads; and perhaps down the line, after the deal with Microsoft closes, it will give it an avenue to sell more Microsoft products to them, too.
“India is a vital market for LinkedIn, as we work towards realising our vision of creating economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce,” said Akshay Kothari, Country Manager and Head of Product, LinkedIn India, in a statement. Kothari joined LinkedIn when the company acquired Pulse, the newsreading app he co-founded. “It’s already one of the world’s most important economies, and continues to experience strong GDP growth. While LinkedIn has grown multiple folds in India since we started operating here 6 years ago, there’s so much more we want to do here. We are committed to India and to boosting our ability to deliver value to even more members and be a part of their professional growth journey, by investing and innovating locally.”",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/linkedin-india.jpg?w=738,,"LinkedIn courts users in India with LinkedIn Lite, online job placement tests, business tools"
174,Steve O'Hear,"Can a chatbot help you manage your money? Three London-based fintech startups are betting on the answer being yes and have jumped aboard the messaging gravy train as they seek to entice millennials to their respective platforms.
The thinking goes something like this: A conversational interface, coupled with tech that plugs into your bank account and analyses your spending in the background, is the best way to deliver financial assistance to help you keep track of your money and actually save for a rainy day.
More broadly these chatbots are targeting  millennials who, they claim, typically aren’t as financially savvy as they could be and who are perfectly comfortable communicating entirely through emoji. I jest, kinda.
Choosing to announce news or fully launch today are Plum, Chip, and Cleo, which is a little awkward. You wait around for a chatbot financial assistant and three arrive at once, said nobody.
Founded by Victor Trokoudes and Alex Michael, who were part of the early teams at TransferWise and Tictail respectively, Plum is billed as the first AI powered Facebook chatbot that enables you to start saving small amounts of money effortlessly. The chatbot connects your current account and Plum’s AI learns your spending habits, allowing it to automatically deposit small amounts of money into your Plum savings account every few days.
In a call with Trokoudes, he told me the idea is that you can “micro save” in a way in which you barely notice. Plum does this by looking at your last 3-12 months spending and predicts how much you can afford to save now and in the future.
He also says that Facebook messenger is an appropriate way to deliver a saving assistant, not only because messaging apps are where Plum’s target users already congregate, but also because Plum is largely a background process. Why ask users to download an app when most of the heavy lifting takes place outside of the Plum UI.
Plum is currently in private Beta in the U.K. and will move to invite-only at the end of October. It has just closed $500,000 in seed funding from 500 Startups’ microfund and a number of angels.
Founded by Simon Rabin and Nick Ustinov, who previously founded Roamer, on the surface Chip is a micro-saving chatbot similar to Plum. The key difference being that Chip has actually launched and has chosen to develop its own iOS and Android chatbot app rather than relying on an existing messaging app like Facebook Messenger.
“We have built Chip to help our friends/peers have a happier and healthier relationship with money,” the startup tells me. “How? Prove they can actually save, and actually afford to save – it’s possible for anyone, whatever you earn, however bad you are with money”.
To achieve this, the Chip bot automatically puts money into your Chip saving account based on what it deems you can afford. It does this by learning your spending habits and running this data through its own AI.
Saving is just the start: I’m told that the big vision for Chip is to be able to offer a range of financial services that are “price transparent and help the customer have a happier and healthier financial life”. Think competition in overdrafts, personal loans, and forex.
That’s a vision echoed by Plum’s Trokoudes, who, borrowing from the TransferWise playbook, sees many slices of the banking pie where more value can be passed directly onto the consumer. You no longer need to be a bank to have access to a customer’s bank account data from which there are a plethora of value-add opportunities.
A graduate of Entrepreneur First, Cleo bills itself as an intelligent assistant for your money. The AI-powered chatbot, which gets its full launch today, lets you interrogate your bank accounts and credit card data and helps you keep track of your spending and hopefully budget better.
“We’re focused on making managing your money really really simple, not roundups or microsavings,” Cleo co-founder and CEO Barnaby Hussey-Yeo tells me. “It’s for people that would rather not spend a couple of hours every week in a spreadsheet trying to manage their cash”.
The startup uses machine learning to help make you smarter with your money and to automate a lot of what Hussey-Yeo describes as the boring stuff, such as categorising transactions or making sense of graphs. “We try to deliver actionable ways to save in 140 characters or less, in realtime using live data,” he adds.
In practice, this ranges from managing subscriptions, optimising your day-to-day spending to finding better financial products. Not dissimilar to Plum and Chip, the bigger picture for Cleo is to offer a full range of banking products using the data you’ve handed over and its algorithms to make sure you’re always getting the best deal.

175,Steve O'Hear,"Just Eat, the online takeout ordering behemoth, has invested in U.K. startup Flypay, which has built a platform to help restaurant and pub chains consolidate their various and disparate technology solutions. The size of the round is £3.5 million and serves as an extension to the company’s previous Series A that saw it pick up £7 million led by media brand TimeOut.
The investment is also described as a “strategic partnership” and sees Just Eat become the latest tech partner on Flypay’s Flyt platform, which lets restaurants and pubs/bars integrate numerous tech and services, from bookings and loyalty, to things like delivery and reviews.
The startup originally focussed on providing a pay-at-table app to let you settle your restaurant bill “waiter-free,” before adding additional services such as order and collect, order at table, pay at bar and customer loyalty features.
However, it has since realised that there is more value in building a technology stack that doesn’t just compete with but integrates many of the tech solutions the hospitality industry already uses.
“For hospitality operators, our new Flyt platform aims to make it significantly easier to innovate around digital commerce, both in terms of integrating technologies across the customer journey… into their own apps, as well as connecting into the biggest aggregator apps and other platforms, such as messaging, voice commerce and who-knows-what’s-next,” Flypay founder and CEO Tom Weaver tells me.
“Our customers are mainstream casual dining and pubs brands.  We currently work with clients like Wahaca, GBK, Jamie’s Italian, Fuller’s, Chilango, and many others.  We’ve just signed one of the most popular restaurant brands in the U.K., to be announced shortly, to create some uniquely different experiences,” he adds.
To that end, Just Eat and Flypay say they plan to collaborate on “digital experiences” for operators across the casual dining sector. This will see Flypay integrating delivery into restaurant and bars’ own apps, powered by Flyt. But that’s just the start.
There’s also plans to offer Just Eat’s customer base access to in-restaurant experiences, and to work together to make it easier for restaurant, pub and bar operators to “adopt and utilise delivery technology”.
Says David Buttress, CEO of Just Eat, in a statement: “Investing in Flypay will enable us to continue to build a seamless experience for consumers who will be able to order, pay, receive customer care and book delivery through the same product. The technology will help us to enhance our offer to casual dining restaurant chains, enabling them to fulfil delivery using Just Eat. The Flyt platform has the potential to transform the digital journey in the casual dining space and we see huge potential in this technology.”",2016-10-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/t-weaver-_-approved-_-24-11-15.jpg?w=738,"flypay,just-eat",Just Eat backs Flypay to help restaurant and pub chains consolidate their tech
176,Anthony Ha,"When digital comics startup Madefire announced its latest funding round a few days ago, co-founder and CEO Ben Wolstenholme said the company was getting ready to move into virtual and augmented reality. He lived up to that promise in very short order, launching a preview app for Samsung’s Oculus-powered Gear VR platform and demonstrating it at New York Comic Con.
Wolstenholme has told me before that he’s trying to create a “native digital experience” that’s still recognizable as a comics-reading experience. Judging from the demo, that’s still true with the new VR experience — there’s music, sound effects and animation, but you’re still basically reading a comic.
Wolstenholme explained Madefire’s approach to VR as adding a third dimension to the experience. It’s not 3D comics, per se, but as a reader, you feel like you’re hovering in front of the comics panel.
He compared it alternately to theater and to cave paintings, and whichever metaphor you prefer, it makes for a much more immersive experience. When I tried it out, I felt as if I was occupying the same space as the art, which felt so much bigger and more overwhelming than when I’m reading it on my tablet or smartphone screen. (It helps that the comics can also include full 360-degree scenes.)
The Madefire authoring tool should make it relatively simple for creators to customize and control the three-dimensional aspect of their art, Wolstenholme said, but the company is also automatically upgrading its full library of comics: “We should have everything in there by Christmas.”
In the meantime, the demo app currently includes samples from a handful of titles, including DC’s Injustice: Year One and the Madefire original Mono: The Old Curiosity Shop (created by Wolstenholme and Liam Sharp).
I also had a chance to discuss the news to comics artist Dave Gibbons, who’s been working with Madefire for a few years now. He praised the Madefire format, including the new VR support, because it gives artists more control over the reading experience.

As the co-creator of Watchmen and The Secret Service (adapted into the movie Kingsman: The Secret Service), Gibbons has seen comics’ stories and characters moving into other media. He said that comics have “quite recently become used as a prototype or pitching tool for movies.” With Madefire’s new formats, comics can still serve as a springboard of sorts, while also allowing writers and artists to explore new technologies and new ways to keep readers engaged.
“I suppose I’m at the time of life where I feel like I’ve seen it all, so it’s exciting to see something that is fresh and new and still engaging,” Gibbons said.",2016-10-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/madefire-oculus-reduced-50.jpg?w=738,"digital-comics,samsung-gear-vr,oculus,madefire",Digital comics startup Madefire launches its first virtual reality app
177,Anthony Ha,"Game developer Disruptor Beam has already adapted Game of Thrones and Star Trek to the world of smartphones and tablets. Now it’s adding The Walking Dead to that list.
CEO Jon Radoff said The Walking Dead: March to War will be a multiplayer strategy game for iOS and Android, where players (potentially tens of thousands of them on a single map) compete with each other for resources and battle for survival.
It’s a Walking Dead game, so naturally, there will be zombies, but Radoff said that for the most part, “they’re kind of an annoyance.”
“It’s like in the show, where yeah, zombies are occasionally a threat, but the real threat is the other players,” he said.
Radoff added that he sees his company as following in the footsteps of storytelling-focused games companies like LucasArts and Bioware: “With mobile and social network games, there was an opportunity to take that audience for Bioware games and start thinking in terms of billions of people.”
The first thing that Disruptor Beam does to reach that potential audience is focus on adapting popular franchises with big fanbases — people who don’t necessarily think of themselves as gamers but would be willing to try out a related game on their smartphone.
The franchise owners are increasingly willing to work with mobile gaming companies, Radoff said, not just to bring in additional revenue, because also because these games help them stay connected with fans throughout the year and build a community. (Walter Driver, whose company Scopely also made a Walking Dead game, recently told me something similar.)
In this case, Disruptor Beam is working with Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman’s company Skybound Entertainment. Radoff suggested that March to War could “tell the story of rebuilding civilization against a backdrop of feudalism — it’s reliving tribal warfare.”

“We actually go the reverse way,” he said. “We start with the story, which means you have to have these kind of experiences, these type of game systems to manifest it.”

178,Ben Narasin,"

There are three types of science fiction (in my view): crap, serialized crap and hard-science science fiction. The last type contains a wealth of visions of the future, many of which we enjoy today, and is referenced in the names of, or has influenced, many tech startups and world-class entrepreneurs.
When I started fashionmall.com in 1993, there were few people trying to commercialize the newly born web, and widely conflicting views on how, or even if, it could be done. A single science fiction paperback preemptively helped me understand how the web would evolve — without it, I may not have been able to take my company public six years later.
At the time, most assumed the web would be a great egalitarian community where everything was equal, just a click away. If you built it, they would come. When I read Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash (a book I later learned Reid Hoffman and Peter Thiel spent a weekend discussing before PayPal was created), I saw a more geographic metaphor; one where the point of entry was the most valuable land and the further away you were from that point, in a series of single clicks, the more remote and barren your neighborhood would be.
Based on that insight, I spent two years negotiating deals with what would later be called portals; eventually landing AOL, Excite, Yahoo, Netscape, Microsoft and others. We ultimately became larger than most of them combined for the categories we focused on, became a portal in our own right and took the company public — aided in part by the vision from one book.
SciFi, fantasy, D&D and comics are a common root interest in founders and funders alike, and I’d argue they are interests we cannot afford to lose. They show us visions of the future we sometimes go on to build, or that we seek to fund. Charles Stross’s writing on gaming economics, AR and VR has ideas embedded within it that are better than most startup pitches I see. Diamond Age from Stephenson remains the most compelling edtech startup concept never built. Mother of Storms from John Barnes predicted global warming impacts, patent trolls, citizen journalism and private satellite launches far before they became even remotely early ideas for most.
Even China has figured out the importance of SciFi to success. Neil Gaiman recounts a conversation he had with a Chinese party official during their “first-ever state-sponsored science fiction convention in 2007,” when he asked why the event was being held:
Ten years later, China’s movement into creating instead of just making is noticeably successful. While I am not claiming SciFi alone is to credit, one can assume it was additive.
Tech entrepreneurs, aspirants and funders need to read, yet few continue to, even if they did in their youth. It’s not just the SciFi of the past that has so exceptionally helped envision the present, but the continuous flow that helps us imagine the future.
Every few weekends I walk to the library and check out all the new science fiction titles I find.  Some suck. Some I put down after a few chapters. Some are just simple pleasures. But some make me see and think differently. Some give me a window into the future that I store in my mind and sometimes seek out in startups.
I once heard that when NASA gets new images back from space probes they gather a group to review them — including several hard-science science fiction writers — ahead of even many of their own team. These authors spend their lives studying science and writing about what they envision the future can become. I think that justifies a few weekend hours of time from those of us committed to building that same future to learn from their life’s work.",2016-10-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/neal-stephenson12.jpg?w=738,"advice-for-entrepreneurs,science-fiction,entrepreneurship",The importance of science fiction to entrepreneurship
179,Matthew Lynley,"We’re hearing from several sources that a secondary financing round is in the works for GitHub, following its last $250 million financing round that valued it at $2 billion in July last year. However, there’s a little bit of interesting chatter beyond that they’re raising a secondary for potential liquidation of investors or employees, we hear.
There are two parts to the story: first, this secondary round may value the company below the $2 billion valuation from its previous round. One source estimated the range could even be around $1.5 billion, though we couldn’t pin down the exact number. However, another source tells us that this secondary is likely for common stock, which could complicate the matter a bit. It’s hard to tell exactly where preferences lie and what rights investors got, so the valuation calculation can get a little fuzzy here — and it may not, in the end, technically be a down round in the traditional sense.
But perhaps the more interesting one is that a rumor is flying around that Microsoft is sniffing around the company. We aren’t sure if it’s related to an acquisition or potentially a strategic investment (talks around one may inevitably lead to the other), or it could be that the companies may be exploring a deeper partnership. A representative from GitHub said there’s no truth to the Microsoft acquisition rumors, though declined to comment on the rest of the story. A representative from Microsoft declined to comment.
We weren’t able to learn who would be able to participate in this secondary round — whether it would be investors or employees. But either way, given that GitHub is an eight-year-old company, the liquidation event shouldn’t be super surprising.

GitHub is probably one of the most widely-adopted developer tools in the world — serving as a go-to resource for not only managing code repositories, but also a vital part of the whole open source ecosystem. Keeping those open-source projects healthy and active is a pivotal tool for larger companies, which can use contributors as a farm system for their developer teams and also pick off interesting ideas that pop up from those communities. But like any light-touch resource for traditional developers, the company needs to expand into enterprises if it’s going to grow into a fully sustainable business. That’s going to be incredibly challenging.
Speaking of Microsoft — they also have GitHub-like tools within Visual Studio Team Services, so perhaps that’s where the chatter about the company checking in with GitHub is coming from.
GitHub also faces increasing competition, including from the likes of recently-IPO’d Atlassian. Last year, following its IPO, the company immediately jumped 32% on its first day of trading and valued it at $5.8 billion. That was largely on the strength of the company actually being profitable when it went public. There’s also the recently-emerging GitLab, which is based on open-source Git tools, that raised $20 million just last month.",2016-10-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-459236718.jpg?w=738,,GitHub is raising a secondary round
180,John Biggs,"If you’re a maker, a hustler, a shaker, or a serial entrepreneur you probably make a lot of websites. There are a number of tools you can use including Bootstrap (please stop using Bootstrap), Squarespace, and a few cool WordPress plugins. Now there’s also Tilda.
Tilda is basically an easy-to-use responsive page builder that costs $15 a month for a standard landing page. Nikita Obukhov, a Russian web designer and owner of the FunkyPunky design studio, created Tilda as an internal tool but wanted to expand into a wider market. He opened the tool up to general users and now you can use it to drag and drop images and text around a page and basically stick something up in seconds.
One of the differentiators is a tool called the Zero Block. Basically its a web editor inside a web editor that lets you manage typography, draw shapes, and even create animations. It’s Tilda’s secret weapon.
“Users build a website from pre-designed blocks. It’s not templates, so it’s quite flexible and users have freedom. On the other hand, these blocks were created by our highly qualified design team so they look good,” said Obukhov.
I built a quick website for a project in about 15 minutes, using a few stock photos and some text. It was up and running moments after I finished and you can easily assign domain names to your creations. It was a very pleasant experience at the very least.
Tilda is self-funded and they have about 4,000 repeat customers.
While you might not be able to escape Bootstrap completely and while $15 per month is still a lot of dosh for a web page Tilda is definitely a tool I’m adding to my hustler/hacker/weirdo/wantrepreneurial arsenal.",2016-10-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_9478.jpg?w=738,"squarespace,wordpress,free-software,software",Tilda is the web design tool for the rest of us
181,Sarah Perez,"Check I’m Here, a platform that helps colleges and universities track student engagement with campus activities, has raised a million dollars in a Series A round of funding to continue to grow its service. Now live at more than 80 institutions and reaching 400,000 students across 30 states and three countries, Check I’m Here’s advantage is that it’s not just collecting data on how many students attend a given campus activity, but helps the universities and colleges use that data to better involve students in the future, as well as increase retention.
Educational institutions have historically tracked student attendance at extracurricular activities, like leadership seminars, events hosted by student-led clubs and organizations, concerts and other activities, because student engagement is tied to the school’s retention rate — meaning the number of students who end up graduating.
Using the data collected, a school could learn which events have been shown to increase retention, and which students seem to miss those events, then change the way those events are marketed or advertised, accordingly.
They can also see things like which events the students who drop out attend, and how they might have missed reaching them with the events associated with higher retention.
Check I’m Here’s platform includes a variety of tools for the educational institution to take advantage of, including small devices for swiping student IDs when students show up at events; digital waivers; built-in event management systems (similar to Eventbrite); management features for creating, approving and customizing user access to events and their details; budgeting tools for tracking event efficiency and cost per student; marketing tools to engage students across web, mobile, social media and offline; communication and document sharing tools; custom reporting; and more.

Most schools pay for Check I’m Here using money they’ve already budgeted for student events. (Tuition tends to include an “activity and service” fee to fund this.)
In some cases, the schools are upgrading from more manual means of event management and tracking — like clickers and spreadsheets. In other cases, institutions are moving to Check I’m Here from rival systems, like Campus Labs or Orgsync.
What’s interesting is that schools seemed to have greatly preferred either Campus Labs or Orgsync, but both have now been acquired by Leeds Equity Partners, and are merging. That could leave room for Check I’m Here to switch over the schools who aren’t a fan of the new, resulting product.
“Major institutions have been using heavyweight management systems for years,” said founder and CEO Reuben  Pressman. “But the majority of America’s 4,500+ higher educational institutions have not yet tried engagement software. With no existing solutions tailored for their needs, they were disadvantaged in a function that’s critical for every institution.”
“We’re coining ourselves an engagement platform,” he explained to us. “[Competitors] don’t do the data tracking that we do,” Pressman added.
Today, Check I’m Here has signed up a wide range of institutions, including larger schools with as many as 70,000 students to small, private colleges. It’s growing its customer base by 25 percent every quarter, and is currently boasting a retention rate of 98 percent, Pressman claims.
Based in Tampa, Florida, Check I’m Here’s Series A is backed by angel investors, including Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeffrey Vinik, Ronald Schlosser (the former Executive Chairman of McGraw-Hill Education and current board member) and 500 Mobile Collective.
The new funds will be used to go toward continued growth, including hiring. Currently a team of 15, the plan is to add another half-dozen in sales and marketing by year-end.",2016-10-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/engage-comp.png?w=575,"education,students",Check I’m Here raises a million dollars for its student engagement platform
182,Romain Dillet,"Meet Side, a French startup that until recently was called WeSlash. Side is a marketplace for short-term jobs. Companies may need a few extra hands for a few days or weeks, and students may want to work on the side to make a bit of money or gain experience — Side fills this need and raised $1.5 million (€1.3 million) from Connect Ventures, Fly Ventures, Kima Ventures and TheFamily.
“We make it much simpler to seek a job that you’re going to be able to do while studying,” co-founder and CEO Pierre Mugnier told me. “As for companies, we give them access to students who are available and can legally work.”
Think about it as a sort of “staffing-as-a-service” startup. If you have a big product launch coming up or you want to start a newsletter, you may not want to hire someone full time.
And yet, Side isn’t a typical job board or temp agency. Students on Side are freelancers. Companies hire freelancers for a specific job. And Side facilitates all that.
Let’s say you’re a student. Side helps you register to become a self-employed person. After that, Side handles all the administrative tasks — billing clients, collecting payments and paying you. The company also works with Axa for a public liability insurance for all students. The startup takes a 20 percent cut.
More importantly, Side makes sure that you get paid for what you actually do. “Students get paid for every hour of work, not by task,” Mugnier said. “This way, we can protect students so that they don’t work for nothing.”
The typical salary is €15 per hour ($16.74). After Side’s cut, students end up with €12 per hour ($13.39). Many jobs require you to work 5 to 10 hours a week. So you won’t get rich on Side, but it could be an alternative to being a cashier in a supermarket.
A few startups rely on Side to increase their workforce, such as Uber, Doctolib, Deliveroo, Foodora or Drivy. Bigger companies, such as Sodexo or Caisse d’Epargne, also work with Side.
Side is available in France and the U.K; 10,000 students have registered so far, and 300 companies have tried Side. Eventually, Side wants to optimize its platform so a company can start working with a student in 5 minutes.
But the end game is even more ambitious. Right now, many students in Paris deliver food on restaurant delivery platforms, such as Deliveroo and Foodora. Mugnier told me that students should be able to find jobs that are as flexible as becoming a Deliveroo rider, but for all sorts of jobs.

183,Steve O'Hear,"
It sees the Silicon Valley-based investor work with the companies accepted into the program to build and test appropriate growth “hacks,” put better metrics and analytics in place and design a long-term user acquisition strategy.
500 Startups also makes a $200,000 investment in each startup (minus a $50,000 program fee) in return for a negotiated amount of equity. It’s being hosted at hub:raum with sponsorship from Deutsche Telekom.
Noteworthy: This isn’t the first time “Distro Dojo” has set up shop in Europe. The program debuted in London last year, and builds on 500 Startups’ growing presence in the continent, which has seen it make around 140 investments in Europe to date. So, why bring “Distro Dojo” to Berlin, in particular?
“I spent nearly four years working in Berlin’s tech sector and quickly realized there were many opportunities and strengths to its ecosystem,” explains Jess Erickson, program director at 500 Startups.
Specifically, she cites the high-caliber of the local business and technical universities, Germany’s more favorable immigration policies compared to the U.K. and what she says is the city’s ability to attract talented people from all over the world.
“I’ve seen an influx of companies founded in Berlin (as well as exits) and am thrilled that 500 Startups is starting to launch programs into Germany to help accelerate the process,” adds Erickson.
Meanwhile, I asked Matt Lerner, partner at 500 Startups and the person who heads up its London office and leads the European Distro Dojo program, to share any learnings so far.
He tells me that 20 companies have come through the London program and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the hypothesis that there was a need for an accelerator of sorts dedicated to growth marketing has been validated.
“There’s a huge need for someone in the pre-Series A space to help companies learn how to scale. Demand for the program has been really high as word starts to spread about what we do,” he says.
However, one thing that has surprised Learner is that a number of the U.K.’s already established and up-and-coming digital marketers have chosen to join the program.
They include Mat Braddy (former CMO of JustEat) with his startup Rock Pamper Scissors, and Tom Beverley (former head of digital marketing for Fab, OneFineStay, and Confused.com) with his new venture Fy.
This has seen 500 Startups beginning to recruit more companies that already have strong marketing teams that, says Lerner, tend to reap the largest benefit. “We’ve shifted the focus more towards things [like] analytics, usability testing,” he says.
I also asked Lerner if setting up shop in Berlin, rather than London alone, had anything to do with Brexit? “Alas, it was in the books before the fateful vote,” he tells me. “We’ve long been bent on world domination, and Distro Dojos are a good strategy to really get into a market and see the deal flow and the quality of founders and other investors first-hand.”
As for Brexit itself, “we’re watching and hoping,” he says, and notes that 500 Startups is keeping a keen on eye on important startup issues like immigration policy, harmonized fintech regulations across the continent and the free flow of capital and trade.

184,Josh Constine,"SoundCloud’s big differentiator is its offering of unofficial, user-uploaded content that the major labels don’t release and that isn’t on Spotify or Apple Music. Or at least they weren’t. The first unofficial single-track remixes just went live on Spotify and Apple Music thanks to their partnerships with music rights management service Dubset.
Apple struck a deal with Dubset in March, and Spotify did in May, BPMSupreme reported. But the remixes are finally beginning to stream today, starting with this DJ Jazzy Jeff remix of Anderson .Paak.
We’ve reached out to Spotify and Apple for comment. [Update: Spotify confirms that short-form mixes are now available. This is apparently just a small part of its integration with Dubset. It says the bigger part is when long-form mixed content becomes available, but there’s no definite timing on that.]

Still missing are the multi-song mixsets DJs often share from their gigs. But Dubset is also equipped to distribute royalties from those and its deals permit them. Dubset CEO Stephen White tells me “Mixes are coming next!”
Dubset works by scanning an entire mix and matching every part of the track to its Mixbank of snippets of official songs based on Gracenote’s audio fingerprinting database. Dubset matches the samples in a mix to these snippets, then distributes royalties for the play evenly to the original rights holders. In this case, Anderson .Paak’s rights holders would get paid because his music is the basis of Jazzy Jeff’s remix.
White says 700 million people a month listen to mixed content, making it a big opportunity. But record labels have historically fought against unofficial mixes because they considered them piracy since they weren’t getting paid. Dubset gives them a fair share, so they’ll permit remixes and mix sets to stream on the major platforms. Royalty revenue from the platform is shared with rights holders while Dubset gets a cut.
“Content owners have been very supportive. The publishing and label deals we have under license provides a large catalog to work with,” White tells me. This “allows some of the content that until now has only been on YouTube and SoundCloud to come to these great paid services where content owners will get paid!”
The fact that unofficial content is now going live on Spotify and Apple Music could reduce the acquisition potential for SoundCloud, which the Financial Times says is in late-stage negotiations to be bought by Spotify. TechCrunch’s sources confirm the two have recently been talking about M&A. But if Spotify can get the best of SoundCloud’s content without coughing up a ton of money for a broken company that’s been struggling for years…
Without the legal grey area of music as a differentiator, Spotify and Apple Music will end up competing on product features like Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlist and Apple’s Beats 1 live radio station, as well as on exclusives and early access to big releases from top artists.
The real winners here, though, are the artists and listeners. Original rights owners will get paid, remix producers and mixset DJs can share their creativity without being pirates and listeners can hear the music they want no matter how it got made.",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/dubset.png?w=710,dubset,"Spotify and Apple Music get unofficial mixes, the best part of SoundCloud"
185,Anthony Ha,"Kiosked, a company that dynamically inserts ads into a publisher’s content, has a new CEO — co-founder Antti Pasila.
Pasila, who previously served as the company’s chief strategy officer, said his appointment is part of a broader shift: “The key thing is, we’re focusing our resources on the supply side.” In other words, while there are no plans to get rid of Kiosked’s ad-buying tools, Pasila’s strategy moving forward is all about working with publishers.
Most readers don’t get too excited when they hear about new technologies for introducing ads, but Pasila argued that the Kiosked approach actually balances the needs of the publisher and the consumer — something that’s particularly important given the growth of ad-blocking options. Sure, Kiosked ads insert themselves into the story that you’re reading, but they’re meant to be high quality, relevant ads, and they don’t take control away from the reader.


Pasila co-founded the company in 2010 with Micke Paqvalen, the previous CEO, who’s becoming Kiosked’s chairman of the board.
So why is Pasila taking the reins now? He said it’s because he helped develop the publisher-centric strategy — “It was pretty clear that I would probably be the best one to execute this plan” — and is based in the United States, which is where Kiosked has most of its customers. (Paqvalen is based in Finland.)
The company says its revenue grew 400 percent last year, and that its publishers include DailyMail, News Corp and CNN.",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/antti-pasila-5760x3840.png?w=738,kiosked,Co-founder Antti Pasila becomes CEO at programmatic ad company Kiosked
186,Sarah Perez,"There are subscription services for clothes, shoes, accessories, makeup, and even tampons, so why not one for handbags? That’s the premise, at least, behind a new startup called Ivory Clasp, which is promising to offer quality, stylish handbags that retail for over $100 for just $45 per month. The service sends name-brand bags, not knock-offs, and allows you to keep the purses you receive.
Like most subscription apparel and accessories services, Ivory Clasp starts off with a style quiz to learn your individual taste. This basically consists of you choosing the handbags you like best from a series of photos. This data helps the service send you those handbags you’ll like best in the future.
Subscribers can choose to pay $45 per month, or $45 bimonthly to receive a new bag every other month.
The bags are also in-season, as opposed to the older, excess inventory you’d find being sold off at retailers like TJ Maxx. In fact, the company promises that if you find the bag online anywhere – including Amazon – for less than $98, they’ll refund your money. And if you don’t like the bag you receive, you can also send it back for a full refund.

The idea for Ivory Clasp comes from Avi Zolty, previously the co-founder of the Y Combinator-backed startup Beatdeck, and car rental startup Skurt; along with Sean Rimokh, who is the son of Signal Brands‘ Chairman and CEO Jack Rimokh.
(Zolty, as you may recall, made a mistake in his early 20’s when he hacked investor Jason Calacanis’ voicemail as a prank, in hopes of getting attention for his startup. Calacanis later forgave him, and Zolty seems to have learned a lesson about when hustling crosses the line.)
 
Signal Brands, meanwhile, is one of the world’s largest handbag companies, which licenses the Guess?, Splendid, Ella Moss, Trina Turk and Isaac Mizrahi brands.
 
Not surprisingly, these same brands appear to be shipping via Ivory Clasp’s service. Splendid was the first one I received, for example.*
The founders couldn’t speak to Signal Brands’ relationship with Ivory Clasp, nor its investment situation, due to their licensing deals. However, it’s not a subsidiary of Signal Brands, and has its own agreements with the brands its ships.
Ivory Clasp also can’t exactly advertise which brands those are – that’s also part of the deal.
In other words, these brands involved don’t want to be associated with a “discount” service, but they’re happy to get their products into the hands of the right kind of customer. At other times, they can leverage Ivory Clasp’s need for inventory to bump up their minimum order quantity with factory suppliers in order to get better rates as needed.

While subscription handbags may sound like a bit of an unneeded luxury, it fits into a larger trend in e-commerce.
“The problem we’re solving is that there’s a new, 21st century girl who doesn’t have time to be super involved in fashion, or doesn’t have the money to spend on high-end bags or high-end clothing,” says Zolty. But at the same time, this customer doesn’t want to shop at discount stores, he says – they want current styles that are in fashion.
Ivory Clasp keeps around five or six styles on rotation at any time, in order to meet the style needs of customers, while also making sure customers don’t get the same brand every month.
 
The startup has been testing the service for a few months with over 300 active users, and has hit $10,000 in monthly recurring revenue.
What’s surprising is that 40% of customers have opted for the monthly subscription.
“The average women, regardless of price point or demographic, buys basically five to seven bags per year,” notes Rimokh. “So we launched this business with a bimonthly target,” he explains. But the founders decided to add the monthly option to see what would happen, and soon saw that only every 6 out of 10 users opted for bimonthly.
In addition, a small percentage (around 3-5%) start as bimonthly then upgrade to monthly, the realized.
“We say users are more likely to convert from bimonthly to monthly than to cancel,” Rimokh adds.
However, while Ivory Clasp may be doing well among early adopters, it will be challenged by the now numerous subscription clothing services like StitchFix, Le Tote, Rent the Runway, Trunk Club, and others, all which ship bags along with apparel. Whether it can carve out a niche for those who want the occasional handbag, and not one they pick out for themselves, still remains to be seen.
Ivory Clasp is backed by an undisclosed amount of seed funding.
The service is now publicly launching; using the code TECHCRUNCH will give you 25% off.
*  Ivory Clasp didn’t charge me for the initial purchase so I could test the service. I’ve since given the handbag away.

187,Matthew Lynley,"The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Snap — the now-parent company of Snapchat — is working on an initial public offering for as early as March that could value the company at $25 billion or higher.
The company most recently raised $1.8 billion in a financing round in May this year. The company has around 150 million daily active users, and leaked documents reported by TechCrunch showed that it was projecting it could generate as much as $1 billion in revenue in 2017. The company estimated, according to those documents, that it would generate between $250 million and $350 million for 2016.

To be sure, the $25 billion or more figure represents a pretty wide range, and often the details don’t get hammered out until bankers begin to price out the company’s public offering. But with Snapchat showing immense growth from both a user and revenue perspective — and engagement that has marketers salivating — it seems like it’s on track to continue to generate an enormous amount of interest from Wall Street.
Facebook’s advertising business continues to chug along as what would likely be considered the primary competitor, and, after failing to snap up the company, it’s thrown an enormous amount of effort at copying and beating out Snapchat’s features. Today, even, Instagram began touting that it had 100 million daily active users for its Stories feature — which CEO Kevin Systrom actually admitted was a clone of Snapchat’s features.
With the two companies vying for marketing dollars, it appears that Snapchat has enough of an argument for Wall Street that it’s on its way to growing beyond its last post-money $20 billion valuation. With many of the largest IPOs this year being largely successful enterprise company IPOs, it appears that the window may be open for Snap to step in and pick up interest from Wall Street — though Snap would certainly be the largest one in recent years.

188,Natasha Lomas,"Art filter photo app Prisma is adding a big new feature to its iOS app in an update landing today: support for videos.
The app, which lets people turn their selfies into cartoonies by using deep learning algorithms to process photos in various graphic styles, quickly surged to millions of downloads in a viral splash after launching this summer. And just as quickly spawning a rash of fast following clones.
As well as creating arty selfies, users of the Prisma iPhone app can now turn snippets of video up to 15 second long into playable animations by selecting one of the nine filter styles currently available — and waiting for the app’s AI algorithms to weave a frame by frame transformation.
Turning a boring shot of a hallway into a moving comic book in a matter of minutes (as per the clip example below).
Videos can be recorded in the app or selected for processing from the camera roll. You’ll need iOS 10 for Prisma video to work, and a little patience as it can take more than a minute to process a clip depending on length, resolution and which model iPhone you’re using.
Android users will have to be more patient — as there’s still no support for video there.
Prisma says it’s planning to add offline photo processing to the Android app first, in “a week or so”, after which co-founder Aram Airapetyan says they’ll “jump on a video development”. “Android is a tough guy,” he adds.
Processing time for Prisma video on iOS is around two mins for the iPhone 6; 55-60 secs for iPhone 6s; and half a minute for iPhone 7, according to Airapetyan, although in my experience videos seemed to finish process a little quicker than that on average.
All processing is done locally on the device so expect your iPhone hardware to heat up a little as you play around with remixing videos as mosaics or Munches or manga-style cartoons.
Next up on Prisma’s iOS to-do list is adding a GIF creator — with looped video touted as coming “very soon”, aka later this month.
Rough round the edges 
Prisma video on iOS is just a beta launch at this stage, with Airapetyan touting improvements in quality coming down the pipe, and an expanded choice of art filters to style clips — adding their intention is to make all Prisma’s photo processing styles available for video, and add some new ones too.
They’re not first to the punch with art filtered video, though — others, such as the startup behind photo processing app PicsArt, got there before them. (In PicsArt’s case siloing video processing into a second standalone app, called Magic Video).
But Airapetyan is dismissive of rivals’ efforts. “We’re faster and better, taking into account the fact that we’re launching videos in beta, as the final quality will be much better,” he argues when asked how Prisma video stacks up against PicsArt’s take.
“We’ll also increase the photo styles’ quality within a couple of weeks,” he adds.
It’s fighting talk, but Prisma is clearly now having to play catch up with the competition, thanks to its early viral success.
At this beta stage the quality of Prisma video also has some rough edges. More polished looking results are possible with Magic Video — although personally I prefer the simpler Prisma interface vs all the toggles and layers available in Magic Video (but if you prefer a greater choice of editing options and tools you’ll likely disagree).
In a quick test of Prisma video ahead of the new feature launch I found results looked a little crude and were less immediately appealing vs Prisma’s art filtered photos — with a tendency towards producing flickery footage.
That said, as with the art photos, different Prisma filters can yield pretty radically different results, some of which look better than others. So you’ll want to spend some time playing around with different styles.
I found there was typically at least one style that looked interesting if not entirely pleasing. So there’s certainly fun to be had here, although perhaps less instant viral potential vs the snap and share gratification of art filtered selfies.
Here are a couple more test clips I made — using the ‘Gold Fish’ and ‘The Scream’ filters respectively:
And here’s a longer form video made by music group Tweed, apparently incorporates Prisma’s tech (although — take note — the app has a hard stop at 15 seconds of video, so you’re not going to be able to create anything as long form yourself using just Prisma, just yet)…
For both video and photos Prisma’s app does not offer as many granular controls for processing as PicsArt’s two apps do. But Prisma’s simplicity is very much part of the viral appeal here IMO. Nor does Prisma require you to register just to process a few photos… But sure, horses for courses — if you want a more fully featured image editing app then Prisma is not it.
Looking purely at the photo filter effects, I also personally prefer Prisma’s results — finding PicsArt’s results generally more garish. But again that’s a matter of personal taste.
Despite — or perhaps because of — its single feature focus, Prisma continues to rack up downloads. It tells TechCrunch it’s now had around 70 million downloads at this point, just over three months after launch.
Back in August it was running at 55M+ downloads — and the app’s early popularity attracted speculation over the summer about whether or not the team would raise VC funding to keep developing or else get snapped up a social platform giant like Instagram or Snapchat keen to beef up its own in-house content creation talent.
In the event, Prisma has done neither. Instead it has started monetizing usage via sponsored styles that are available in the apps.
Currently it has one sponsored filter launched (called Gett), with another slated as coming later this month. And the team does not seem as if it’s about to accept a big outside investment.
“I think we’re ok,” adds Airapetyan, responding to a direct question about whether they’re raising funding. But whether a new kid on the block app with millions of downloads but no social sharing platform of its own, and a bunch of copycats seeking to eat its lunch, can turn a cool feature into a sustainable business remains to be seen.",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/device-comp.png?w=738,"prisma,art-filters,video,picsart","Prisma adds art filtered video, GIFs coming next"
189,Matthew Lynley,"Emburse launched in the Startup Battlefield last year seeking out businesses that wanted to handle one-time or a few expenses through issuing prepaid corporate debit cards. But it may be that the market, which is filled with a disparate different kinds of tools, needs a more generalized approach.
So to move beyond that, Emburse said it is opening up its service to integrate with other operations, such as building bots on Slack. With that, companies can spin up and issue prepaid cards through a number of other integrations without always having to come back to Emburse. In that way, Emburse can become a much more prolific service within traditional corporate environments and not just typical Silicon Valley early adopter companies.
“A lot of the valley are using common tools, whether it’s Slack or they’re using Greenhouse or Expensify,” co-founder Peter Lai said. “What we’re trying to do is make an addition. Once you build one integration you don’t have to do it multiple times, because we share a lot of mutual clients.”
Emburse works with banks and card-issuers to create custom pre-paid debit cards that can either be used one time or are refillable. But they are designed to be managed more rigorously through Emburse, so a finance team can keep close track of behavior.
One example use case of the new service, Lai said, would be to allow Greenhouse on behalf of recruiters to issue cards for travel and food while they are interviewing for a job. Another would be operating with a virtual assistant that might be booking flights, which users may not initially trust, Lai said.

190,John Biggs,"Fabricating a circuit board isn’t tough but it takes a while. The back and forth, the bugs, and all of the shipping costs can turn a small project into a big problem. That’s why Botfactory raised $1.3 million to stick a PCB printer on your desk.
Founded by NYU grad students Nicolas Vansnick and Carlos Ospina along with NYU professor Michael Knox, BotFactory came about when Vansnick and Ospina needed to make a PCB for a class project. Nearly every student in the class failed because they couldn’t get circuit boards made in time and each iteration took weeks to complete.
“This lesson was tremendous – if this was a problem that was typical for any project, then the solution would revolutionize how electronics could be prototyped and fabricated,” said Vansnick. “Up until then, everybody had been trying to miniaturize electronics and chips, but not the processes that are employed to create PCBs.”
Their first product, the Squink, took off. They’ve already shipped 106 machines and they’re on track to ship a dozen more. The Squink is obviously a niche product – not all of us need pick-and-place machines in the office – but it’s a great start for a fascinating project. The kit uses conductive ink or solder and can place components right on a circuit board.
They raised $1.3 million from NY Angels as a lead investor.
“Ultimately our goal is to provide a desktop machine that can allow someone to make a board here and now, at a relatively low cost,” said Vansnick.
Traditionally, PCB manufacture consisted of sending a schematic to a fabricator in Asia and then waiting for the board or single chip to be sent back. Any bugs in the system take another few weeks to fix and then another few weeks to ship. By moving the entire process to a piece of hardware in your office the lads at BotFactory fixed a massive time sink.
The basic Squink costs $3,199 and more advanced versions cost up to $4,499. Again, it’s not quite in the real of maker pricing but, as Han Solo said to Spock, “Away put your weapon, these are the bots you seek [for making PCBs at home]!”",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/product_template_616.jpeg?w=738,"electrical-engineering,pcb,pollution",BotFactory raises $1.3 million to help you build circuit boards on your desktop
191,Devin Coldewey,"It isn’t quite as lovable as the spherical droid from Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but this robot from Carnegie Mellon University has the benefit of being more than a special effect (however cool). And believe it or not, it basically has no moving parts.

Anyway, the robot is actually an evolution of a decade-old design: Ralph Hollis created the “ballbot” long ago, but it was driven mechanically. The way it worked is actually quite easy to picture: imagine a mouse ball, but instead of the ball moving the little rollers inside, the rollers move the ball.

Carefully controlling these motors lets the robot essentially balance on top of the ball while also rolling it in any direction. The trouble was the same as with those mice: the rollers wore out or got dirtied up, and had to be replaced, and the motors recalibrated.
The solution wasn’t to remove the ball, as we did with mice, but to remove the rollers. The new version uses an induction motor, which magnetically drives the sphere (solid iron, with a copper shell) with stators, the way other induction motors would drive a rotor.
This reduces wear and increases the level of control over the ball, since there are fewer mechanical forces to worry about. Just adjusting the voltage and the magnetic force on the ball propels it where you want it to go. Onboard systems keep it upright and balanced, and it can recover from being pushed around — not as much as a legged robot, but still.
The SIMbot (for spherical induction motor) is still very much a lab-bound experiment, but its omnidirectional motion and sophisticated yet elegant control mechanisms are likely a source of envy to robots that use legs or multiple wheels to get around.",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/ballbot_simbot.jpg?w=738,"carnegie-mellon-university,robotics,robots",This ‘ballbot’ is like a real-life BB-8
192,Devin Coldewey,"Virtual reality is pretty convincing when you’re all jacked in and wired up — but even the best headsets today aren’t particularly sharp. Sharp, taking notice of this, has produced a display specifically for VR that’s double the resolution of what’s out there right now.

At 2160×1920 (for the rectangle, naturally; the circle is likely 1920 in diameter) and just about 2 inches across, these displays have an impressive pixels-per-inch rating of over 1,000. The 5-6-inch displays we have on our phones are generally in the 300-500 range, and that’s also the case for the panels being used inside the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. It’s not the highest PPI ever, though — panels with over 2,000 PPI have been made, but this one is tailored to VR.
Assuming these Sharp displays are at least as good in terms of color and response time — and their IGZO method suggests that should be the case — they could lead to a huge improvement to the VR experience. Remember the iPhone before and after Retina display? That kind of huge.
One other device on display caught my eye: this 5.2-inch, “Free Form” HD panel with rounded corners used to create an impressive edge-to-edge phone prototype. I’d definitely rock that.

193,Darrell Etherington,"Skylanders, Amiibo, Disney Infinity — the toys-to-life category got big, fast, but most of the action in the space following Skylanders tended to be mostly derivative, without really pushing the category forward when it comes to the breadth of available technologies. Lightseekers, a new cross-platform action RPG game debuting on Kickstarter today that incorporates physical toys created by partners TOMI, hopes to address that lack of forward progress.
Lightseekers comes from PlayFusion, by a team including people who also worked on popular MMORPG RuneScape at Jagex prior to that, and which hopes to do something similar for toys-to-life, with a mobile-first approach and flexible play dynamics that allow for online multiplayer, solo digital or even old-school analog offline play, all of which is tied together and informs and evolves experiences across the range of options.
The basic mobile game pairs a roving mobile adventure RPG with a rich universe complete with deep history, with Bluetooth-enabled action figures that will talk to your mobile device automatically, rather than requiring a portal or hub like many existing toys-to-life options. The characters also include embedded motion sensors, which means in certain game modes you can use them as physical controllers for what’s happening in-game, almost like a Wii controller. The physical toys can also interact with one another, both while you’re actively playing the mobile game and while you’re offline using them more as traditional action figures.
But is toys-to-life a smart place to build a business these days? Disney notably exited the category with the announcement earlier this year that it would not continue the Disney Infinity line, which seemed like a poor reflection on the state of interactive toys overall. PlayFusion and TOMI believe that any failure to capitalize on the nascent market isn’t due to lack of interest from consumers, however.
“As a result of lack of innovation, the industry, whilst it’s grown significantly, could’ve grown way more,” explained PlayFusion CEO Mark Gerhard in an interview. “Given the fact that everyone really has the same technology and the same offering, they’re just bifurcating each other’s businesses and they’re fundamentally fatiguing consumers, and I’m one of them.”
With Lightseekers, the goal is to inject new life into the whole concept of toys-to-life with a game aimed at a slightly older and more sophisticated demographic than the target audience for category pioneer Skylanders. RPG mechanics allow advanced gamers to go as deep as they want, while Gerhard says that novice and casual players can still also easily pick-up-and-play. The game is designed to be flexible not only in how you can play it, but also in who it appeals to.

“We don’t want to compete with Skylanders; we want to be the graduation product for Skylanders,” Gerhard explains. “If you’ve been playing that for five years and you love that experience, but now you’re looking for something more, something a bit more adult, older and grittier, but still family friendly, then we want to be that product you go to.”
Currently, Gerhard says, a lot of people look to something like Anki or Sphero as the next logical step in terms of where to go from Skylanders, but the cost of entry for those products is quite high, at around $200. Lightseekers on Kickstarter is offering a package that includes one Bluetooth-enabled action figure, a weapon accessory, AR-capable cars from the TCG and more accessories, including digital bonuses.

Gerhard also emphasized that the Lightseekers characters and accessories are intended to grow and evolve over time, and not in the easy, sequential level-up style used by most toys-to-life games today. Weapons and add-ons could provide totally different in-game benefits as you progress through the game, for instance, and characters are designed to form more lasting relationships with players, so you grow with one or two over time instead of necessarily feeling the need to collect them all.
The PlayFusion and TOMI teams aim to launch its digital beta by the end of this year, with retail availability and a full consumer launch targeted for Spring 2017.",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/environment_02.png?w=720,toys-to-life,Lightseekers aims to evolve toys-to-life with rich stories and many ways to play
194,Darrell Etherington,"Amazon launched another benefit for Prime members today, Prime Reading, which lets users read from a section of more than a thousand Kindle books, digital magazines, short stories, comics and more for free as part of their subscription. It’s essentially a version of Kindle Unlimited with a pared-down catalog (Unlimited boasts more than one million books, magazines and audio books) but without any additional cost if you’re already a Prime member.
Books on the service include classics like The Hobbit, and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, but the magazine selection actually sounds potentially more appealing, because it has current issues of titles like National Geographic Traveler, People, Sports Illustrated, Popular Mechanics and more. Prime Reading content can be accessed either via the Kindle app or Amazon’s own Kindle devices.
A key selling point for Prime Reading: The Essential Calvin and Hobbes is the first option in its comics list. Another key selling point: You already have it if you’re already a Prime subscriber. I may actually cancel my Kindle Unlimited subscription as a result of this launch, which probably isn’t the most desired outcome for Amazon, but because I use it most for random, idle reading, even with the smaller content library there’s a lot there for casual browsing.",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/prime_reading_image.jpg?w=738,,Amazon’s new Prime Reading gives Prime members all they can read
195,Darrell Etherington,"Google unveiled a lot of new devices today, but at the core of nearly everything was a commitment to Assistant specifically, and to showing off what Google’s range of service offerings can do. I sat down with Google Canada’s Head of Public Affairs Aaron Brindle after the satellite keynote event here in Toronto to discuss what hardware means for Google now, and how its work in artificial intelligence and machine learning fits in with the device side of the equation.
“One of the most important messages of today is that Google is taking hardware very seriously,” Brindle said. “What we’ve seen with the Android ecosystem is that the pace of innovation there is amazing — there are now 1.4 billion daily users on Android. However, this is not about bringing the best of Android to our users — it’s about bringing the best of Google to our users. So that’s taking in all of the investments and research that we’re doing around AI and ML, and packaging it front to back in hardware.”
Brindle says that while there’s plenty of great work being done by Android OEM partners, Google still sees places where it can supplement the options available to consumers. He also suggested that Google is looking at more than just the hardware and software side of being a device company — they recognize the importance of the sales and marketing experience on that side of the business, too.
“The reality is that one size doesn’t fit all in the Android space, and we recognize that there is a big opportunity to create something from nuts to bolts,” he said. “Not only in the software and the hardware, but in the marketing, in the support, in the retail piece, and we felt there was something missing there.”
Whether that means we’ll see full brick-and-mortar retail remains to be seen, but already Google is rethinking its web-based device sales with new installment-plan payment options for devices it sells directly via the Google Store online for over $150 in the U.S.
As for how Assistant plays in, and where it gets its impressive smarts, Brindle says it’s core to the Pixel devices, and has been made possible thanks to very recent improvements in the capability of Google’s AI.
“You heard the Assistant come up throughout this piece, and it is central, it is the marquee piece in the new phone,” he explained. “That is based on advances in AI — I mean tremendous advances, not just in the past year since the last Nexus phone, I mean in the past several months. Advances in translation, and image recognition, for example.”
Brindle says that Google’s operation in Canada is actually a core part of these efforts, given the country’s research leadership in the field.
“All of that research comes from the work that we’re doing in AI, and some of the best researchers in AI are based here in Canada,” he said. “So [Google Distinguished Researcher] Geoffrey Hinton’s work on machine learning, particularly the integration of his work on neural nets and how that has shaped our AI advances, it’s all in there.”
Google’s approach is about more than just owning the phone experience end-to-end — it’s about crafting a comprehensive approach to delivering the next generation of its platform, which will be based around AI and ML and will look to devices like the Pixel and Pixel XL as perfectly suited delivery vehicles. It’s not quite a pivot, but this definitely signals a sea change in Google’s approach to its own identity and business.",2016-10-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/pixel.jpg?w=738,"google-pixel,smartphones","Google’s new smartphones are about Google, not Android"
196,Brian Heater,"Sometimes it’s best to just sit back and feign surprise, as though the lead up to today’s big Google event wasn’t leakier than a rusted out old sieve in a rainstorm. After making several brief but notable cameos on international retailer and carrier pages this week, the company took to the stage at today’s Pixel event to reveal the titular handset – positioned by the company as its largest hardware reveal in years.
The base-level (the plain ole Pixel) looks like all of those leaks suggested – which is to say fairly featureless on its face, not dissimilar from a iPhone, only devoid of a physical button in that large stretch of bezel beneath the display. As anticipated, the Pixel will come in two sizes, the standard 5-inch(with a 441ppi pixel density) and the 5.5-inch XL (534ppi), both of which are encased in Gorilla Glass 4). To be fair, the handset is arguably more “L” than “XL” by current standard.

The rear of the device is a combination of glass and metal with a fingerprint reader smack dab in the center, along with an antenna band along the bottom and Google’s new “G” logo along the bottom. Oh, and as noted by the company at the event, there’s “no unsightly camera bump” back there.
Though, bump or no, the company is convinced that it’s got a killer camera here. The Pixel received  an impressive 89 from DXOMark’s camera benchmarks. “This isn’t only the best smartphone camera we’ve ever made,” the company said on stage, “it’s the best smartphone camera ever made.” The hardware features a 12.3-megapixel rear camera (with an f/2.0 lens) and 8-megapixels on the front.

Google showed off the Pixel’s prowess in lowlight situations, helped along by the camera’s 1.55 micron pixels. A Smartburst mode, meanwhile, is designed to take several shots in quick succession, while the Lens Blur feature offers a similar bokeh effect as the one found on the latest iPhone. The phone is also capable of capturing 4K video at 30FPS.

Those who pick up the Pixel will also get their hands on free unlimited storage on Google Photos with photos shot at their original resolution, while the new Quick Switch Adapter hardware makes it easier to transfer files from an old Android device — or even an old iPhone.
The new flagship is powered by a quad-core Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB of RAM and a decently sized 2770mAh battery, which can quick charge up to seven hours in 15 minutes. The XL, naturally, features a much beefier 3,450mAh.The phones are rated at 13 and 14 hours of life on a charge, respectively. The Pixel ships with 32GB of storage standard, which users can chose to quadruple up to 128GB.

There’s a USB-C port on the bottom of the device, and yes, the thing has a headphone jack (take that, other unmentioned smartphone manufacturers).
While the event is positioned as hardware first, this is Google we’re talking about here, and as such, the real focus is software. The company led the event with talk about its forthcoming Google Assistant AI, and as such, the Pixel will be the first handset to ship with the friendly voice helper. As the company puts it, “we’re building hardware with the Google Assistant it its core. ”

Surely that’s all that “Google Magic” we were seeing in a number of those aforementioned leaks ahead of the event. And indeed, the new assistant performed impressively during the demo. The phone will also, naturally, ship with Google’s new messaging app Duo (and Allo) pre-installed. Both handsets will also be the first to ship with 7.1 — the latest version of Android Nougat (even while LG V20, the first handset to ship with 7.0 has yet to arrive at retail).

Interestingly, the company has also built customer support directly into the Pixel — akin to the sort of help Amazon offers up on its Kindle Fire tablets via MayDay, complete with screen sharing.

The Pixel comes in three colors –Very Silver, Quite Black, along with a limited edition Really Blue (really) version, which is exclusive to the US. Pre-orders for the new handsets start today in the US, Canada, and Australia, with buyers in India getting their chance on the 13.

The base-level Pixel starts at $649 or $27 a month. Users can pick it up unlocked through Google’s site or tied to Verizon, the phone’s exclusive carrier here in the States. Google’s also got a whole slew of accessories available for pre-order, so you don’t scratch that lovely glass and aluminum surface.

197,Darrell Etherington,"Olympus unveiled the OM-D E-M1 Mark II at Photokina this year, and the follow-up to the company’s original pro offering is the kind of evolution you’d expect from a digital camera coming four years later on. Everything about the camera has been touched, from exterior design, to sensor and processor, to software features, and the result is a compact, capable device that seems ready for just about any shooting scenario.
The device I got to spend a little time with was a pre-production sample, and final release timing and pricing are still to be determined for the E-M1 Mark II, but even so, using the updated camera revealed it has a lot of potential. It has 20.4 megapixel sensor, uses the micro four-thirds sensor size, two quad-core processors on board to handle image processing and advanced AF/IS, and a new bright electronic viewfinder with a max frame rate of 120fps and six millisecond lag for essentially real-time, smooth tracking of fast action.
The E-M1 matches table stakes for pro cameras with a solidly constructed, weatherproof and dustproof frame, but its body overall is much more compact than you’d see from most APS-C or full frame mirrorless or DSLRs. Olympus’ choice to stick with the micro four-thirds sensor forma means this camera is very compact, and even pairing it with the company pro 300mm f4.0 (600mm equivalent) lens still results in something you can comfortably carry on along with your other luggage.
A new 12-100mm (24-200mm equivalent) f4.0 M.Zuiko Pro lens ($1,299, ships in November) is the real all-arounder, however, in terms of pairings with the E-M1 II. This has a zoom range that covers the standard Canon photographer’s kit of 24-70 f2.8 and 70-200 f2.8 lenses in a single lens. It’s not as bright as those at max aperture, but in practice indoors, at least during the short time I had with it, it seemed plenty bright to produce clean images. Olympus also told me that the lens is designed to be optically sound and distortion free across the entire zoom range, avoiding the “sweet spot” pitfalls that beset most telephotos.
Besides the combo of the E-M1 II and that zoom providing pretty much unmatched wide- to tele-range in a package that’s smaller than most DSLR 70-200 lenses on their own, the camera also has a few other features that recommend it as a do-anything utility player. These include in-body 5-axis image stabilization, which pair with 4-factor stabilization in Olympus lenses that offer IS, for a 6.5-factor total stabilization effect.
This means butter smooth video handheld, even when shooting 4K (which the camera also supports). I tried this, and the results looked great, with the proviso that I could only see them on the viewfinder and couldn’t properly evaluate color accuracy or other factors. But the motion was rock solid – it was similar to what you’d get using a gimbal or steadicam with other cameras.
Another useful feature is the electronic shutter (which lives alongside a mechanical shutter option in the camera). This makes it possible to shoot completely silently (the only noise you hear is the lens autofocusing, ti’s actually a bit eerie), and to shoot burst mode at as much as an insane 60fps, depending on your settings. Even using the mechanical shutter, you’re going to get about 15 fps at the top end, which is, again, category leading.
AF is also fast and accurate, thanks to 121 cross-type AF points that cover essentially the entire visible frame. Basically, if you can see it on the VF, there’s an autofocus point that can probably hit it without requiring much at all in the way of focus and recompose.
The original OM-D E-M1 was a solid performer that still gets a lot of respect four years on, and this new iteration seems like it could be a true renaissance device, with tremendous potential for shooters who also need to delivery high quality video. Again, all of this is based on very limited initial testing, so I’ll reserve final judgement for a proper review, but Olympus definitely seems to have addressed the will of the market in terms of delivering on the promise of a compact pro digital camera.",2016-10-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/147a0163.jpg?w=738,,The Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II might be the most flexible mirrorless camera
198,Jay Bregman,"

The FAA released some staggering numbers as it welcomed Part 107, otherwise known as the rules governing — or perhaps creating — the commercial drone industry in the U.S.: Within one year, the FAA estimates that 600,000 drones will be active in commerce in the United States.
Even if you assume every pilot has, on average, 1.2 drones, that’s still half a million commercial drone pilots. But where are all these pilots coming from, and what are they going to do with those drones?
Up until now, the process of becoming a commercial drone pilot was onerous. First, you had to be (or hire) a licensed manned aviation pilot, then have a lawyer to file paperwork related to exactly how you were going to operate your drone, often waiting up to six months before you received your certificate.
Today, the process takes 10 days. The first step is a $150 test you can take at any of 600 FAA-approved test centers (unless you are one of the few to have a manned pilot certificate, in which case the test is replaced with online training). It may be cheap, but this test is by no means easy, including questions on aeronautical charts, aviation law and the effects of weather conditions on flight. The final step is a TSA vetting, similar to applying for TSA Precheck.
The FAA also has set some general rules of the road — you must fly in daylight, away from airports and with your drone in your line of sight. Yet even these rules can be waived, and there have already been 76 waivers granted (at the time of writing this). So if you can dream it, you can probably do it under Part 107.
That brings us back to the bigger question: Where will these half a million new pilots come from and what exactly what will they be doing?
Maybe existing pilots will transition to drones. There are currently 171,000 FAA-licensed private pilots in the U.S. Even assuming that every one of them caught the drone bug and decided to quit their day job (which we all know is unlikely), that would still leave 329,000 who are expected to register as commercial users this year. Because only about 6,000 people are currently registered as commercial drone pilots, that means there will be more than 300,000 new commercial users directly resulting from the new regulation. That’s more than the population of Orlando.
The natural first question is whether these new pilots will be part of larger organizations, small business owners or individuals. Because the FAA estimates that 90 percent of commercial drones will have an average price under $2,500, think Phantom or Inspire drones. And when the tools of your trade are cheap enough for most Americans to afford on their own, there is little incentive to become part of a larger organization. So this leaves about 290,000 sole proprietors and small businesses on pace to register this year. This represents a whopping 52X growth in drone pilots year over year. But where will all these new users come from and what will these drones be used to do?
Typically they started out as consumers — receiving a drone as a gift, or having saved up for one as a special purchase — and fell in love with flying. They got so good at it that people started asking them to do favors; take a video of a house, do a roof inspection, snap some aerial family photos or perhaps survey a construction site. All it takes is a website and business cards and voilà — they had a sideline drone enterprise.
And how do they find clients? They hustle. They are always looking for new ways to add value to their clients through aviation. Part 107 will now put these enthusiasts on equal footing with the manned pilots currently working the skies. By the time this is all over, the number of commercial drone pilots will easily eclipse the entire manned pilot population in the United States — the only question is: how many times over?
These drone lovers are now triggering a wave of commercial drone applications as early adopters of a trend that is soon to become a mainstream occupation. The new rules provide structure for commercial users to operate legally and, in doing so, have leveled the playing field.
The winners will be the best entrepreneurs — the ones who find innovative ways to scale and delight their clients. Even the equipment is now readily available, thanks to a robust market for commercial-grade drones at consumer-friendly prices. When people can make back their investment on something they want by doing what they love, great things will happen.",2016-10-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/shutterstock-capitol-drones.jpg?w=738,"faa,part-107,drones",The entrepreneurs behind the new drone economy
199,Devin Coldewey,"A study from Cambridge University documents an immense drop in complaints against police officers when their departments began using body cameras. But even more surprising is that the data suggests everyone is on their best behavior whether the cameras are present or not.
The data was collected in seven police departments in the UK and US, and represents over 1.4 million hours logged by 1,847 officers in 2014 and 2015; the researchers published their data last week in the journal Criminal Justice and Behavior.
Officers were randomly assigned to wear or not wear cameras week by week (about half would be wearing them at any given time), and had to keep them on during all encounters. The authors used complaints against police as a metric because they’re easy to measure, an established practice in most police forces and give a good ballpark of the frequency of problematic behavior.
In the year before the study, 1,539 complaints in total were filed against officers; at the end of the body camera experiment, the year had only yielded 113 complaints.
This would be enough to warrant further investigation or even deployment — complaints are not just indicative of misconduct, but expensive and time-consuming to address — but the study developed another wrinkle that may be even better news.
Against all expectations, there was no significant difference in complaints between officers wearing cameras that week and those going without.

“It may be that, by repeated exposure to the surveillance of the cameras, officers changed their reactive behaviour on the streets — changes that proved more effective and so stuck,” explained the study’s lead author, Barak Ariel, in a Cambridge news release. “With a complaints reduction of nearly 100 percent across the board, we find it difficult to consider alternatives, to be honest.”
The researchers dub this effect “contagious accountability” — learning to do the right thing even when no one is watching.
Specifics on how exactly this is happening are unclear. Is the officer less confrontational to begin with, avoiding escalation? Or are suspects and complainants more wary of their conduct? Is it some combination of the two, or are even more factors involved? To determine these things would be a far more complex and subtle piece of research, but the study does suggest that officer behavior is probably the most affected, and that other effects flow from that.
Future research has plenty of directions to take, but the effect demonstrated here is robust and beneficial enough to take seriously and, for some police departments, it may be enough to tip the balance in favor of deploying cameras.
Ariel and co-author Alex Sutherland will be discussing their research at Cambridge’s Festival of Ideas in two weeks; if you’re in the area, swing by if you’d like to know more.",2016-10-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-599731398.jpg?w=738,"cambridge-university,science,police,body-cameras",Police complaints drop 93 percent after deploying body cameras
200,Jordan Crook,"The AOL Alto team is today delivering a new version of the product that may make some of your biggest email woes disappear.
Enter the Alto Dashboard.
With the latest version of AOL Alto, users can choose between a regular inbox view and a dashboard view of their communications. Dashboard view surfaces contextually relevant information right to the top of the page and offers the ability to take action on those emails.
Let’s say you booked a flight to South Korea two months ago, and your flight leaves tomorrow. Rather than scrolling back through your inbox to find your ticket confirmation, Alto will serve that email up to you as soon as you’re able to check in to your flight. When it’s time to hit the airport, Alto will again serve up that email with the opportunity to retrieve your ticket QR code, without you ever having the need to open up the United Airlines app.
When you land in South Korea, an email with your hotel confirmation will pop to the top of the dashboard with the option to order an Uber straight from the airport to the hotel, with one click of a button.
Alto determines what should be in the Dashboard through an algorithm, but users can tell the system what should or should not be in the dashboard to help it get smarter.
Emails that are deemed worthy of the dashboard, however, don’t look like ordinary emails. Alto transforms the content of those messages into “Cards”, which enables those same integrated actions like checking in for a flight, ordering an Uber, or getting directions to a destination.
Alongside the Dashboard and its Cards, Alto is also introducing Stacks. Stacks are categorized inboxes that put various email verticals all in one place, from travel to shopping to social.
Alto is available as a native app on both iOS and Android, and works across a variety of browsers. The company says it is considering plans to build a native desktop app.
AOL Alto will remain free to users, but there is an opportunity down the line to generate revenue off of brands who wish to engage more directly with consumers via email, according to the team.
You can check out AOL Alto right here.

201,Ingrid Lunden,"Some more details are coming through on Facebook at Work, the social network’s big effort to move into enterprise communication services with a business version of its popular platform. Facebook has now sent out invites for a Facebook at Work launch event to take place in London on Monday, October 10.
The invite confirms our report earlier this week that it would launch next month, and it’s also significant for another reason. It will be the first time that Facebook has launched a global product outside of its U.S. home market.
That makes sense: as we reported back in 2014 before Facebook officially revealed the product, Facebook at Work was conceived and built in Facebook’s London offices, far from the bustle of Menlo Park and its strong focus on consumer services and the company’s existing platform.
Subsequently, while Facebook at Work gradually entered a closed beta, some of the biggest customers have come from Europe, including Telenor and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
We first discovered that Facebook was working on Facebook at Work back in 2014. Facebook eventually made its own official reveal of the product seven months later, in 2015, when it started to test it in closed beta.
Facebook at Work competes against a host of other enterprise collaboration and communication products, ranging from Microsoft’s Yammer and  Salesforce’s Chatter through to HipChat and Slack.
The fact that it’s coming to the market at a time when many of these already have large and entrenched user bases will be a challenge for Facebook when it comes to signing up users.
On the other hand, its advantage lies in the fact that Facebook at Work’s user interface, functionality and even sign-in are all based on Facebook. That makes it instantly easy and familiar to use for many professionals, who will already be at least familiar with the workings of the social network, if not using it on a regular basis. (And that is crucial in a landscape where many companies have struggled to get their workers to engage well on their in-house “conversation” platforms.)
At the same time, Facebook has built in several security features around Facebook at Work that essentially make it into a completely separate platform when it comes to consuming and sharing data.
The event will be led by Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook’s Vice President of EMEA, along with a “number of other Facebook leaders as well as third parties and special guests,” the company notes in an invite.
It’s not clear if CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be there. He does seem to be in the general vicinity right now, posting photos yesterday from a recent trip to Facebook’s new data center in the Arctic Circle.
We’ll be at the event and will report more from there (if not before).",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-29-at-13-06-18.png?w=738,facebook-at-work,Facebook at Work will launch on October 10 in London
202,Josh Constine,"Facebook couldn’t fit all the developers for its F8 conference into San Francisco’s Fort Mason any more, so F8 will take place at San Jose’s McEnery Convention Center on April 18th and 19th, 2017.
Registration hasn’t started yet but will follow the same rules as last year, which you’ll want to follow if you’re trying to get a seat as it always sells out quickly. Luckily it’s not just some first-come, first-serve chaos, but you can pre-sign-up here to get updates.
Facebook will personally invite partners, and everyone else will have to apply during the registration period, providing an explanation about why they want to go and why they should be there. Those selected will be expected to buy a ticket, which last year cost $595, about one-third the price of an Apple WWDC ticket.

The now-annual conference will feature two days of keynotes, typically structured with CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s big talk and lots of core Facebook product news the first day, and deep dives into Facebook’s more futuristic 10-year plan technologies, like VR and internet connectivity, on the second day. There will be more than 45 sessions where developers can learn about how to take advantage of Facebook’s existing platforms and the new stuff it announces.
While Facebook frequently holds smaller press events and consumer product launches, it typically reserves big developer announcements for F8. Facebook was supposed to hold one of those press event today, but instead cancelled the press meeting and told us the news it was going to announce.
Facebook’s Analytics for Apps system is now adding support for web measurement and cross-platform metrics. It says “53% of people who own two devices switch between them to complete tasks or activities, and 77% of people who have three or more devices do the same.” That’s why developers will be able to understand user behavior across devices.
There are also new features that let developers integrate offline information about customers, such as demographics, CRM data and profile information from a developer’s app. New Sharing Insights metrics will help developers predict which content will go viral, and advertisers can target users who shared something from their website with a revamped Custom Audiences feature. Expect more analytics features at F8 2017.

It’s too far out to tell what Facebook will launch at its 2017 conference, but here’s a quick run-down of the biggest announcements from all the previous F8s:
2007 – The Facebook Platform for building apps and games
2008 – Facebook Connect for logging in to other websites with your Facebook credentials
2010 – Facebook’s Social Plugins, including the Like button for sharing from external websites
2011 – The Facebook Timeline profile and the Open Graph platform for auto-sharing from apps
2014 – Facebook Audience Network mobile ad network for helping developers monetize
2015 – The Facebook Messenger Platform for building lightweight content-sharing chat apps
2016 – The Facebook Messenger Bot Platform for building conversational chatbot interfaces

The 2017 plan should come into focus early next year, but here are two big opportunities for Facebook on the developer front.
It’s been rebuilding its games platform with a Steam-style desktop app originally called Facebook Games Arcade. Facebook could announce significant new capabilities for game developers, from ways to port games from other platforms to analytics to monetization to live streaming gameplay footage.
Voice has the power to become a much more prevalent computing interface now that speech recognition has improved and wearable devices like wireless earbuds are proliferating. Facebook acquired voice and chat interface development platform Wit.ai last year and could possibly reveal new voice controls for Facebook and easy ways for developers to build these capabilities into its new apps.",2016-09-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/f8-press-asset-1200x6302x.jpeg?w=738,"san-jose,facebook-developer-garage","Facebook’s F8 2017 conference outgrows SF, hits San Jose April 18th-19th"
203,Anthony Ha,"Meetup is giving users a new way to find the meetups that give the company its name.
The New York City-based company is launching new smartphone apps and a (partially) redesigned website with new branding, as well as a new way to browse meetup listings.
“We killed the calendar,” CEO and co-founder Scott Heiferman said. Instead, Meetup will recommend listings for you based on your own interests, and you’ll also be able to see listings of meetups that are new, trending or happening soon.
That might not seem like a dramatic difference, but Heiferman said it reflects the real way that people use the Meetup service. The calendar view makes you think you should be looking for “what’s going on in Paris tonight,” but he argued, “That’s not how people think. What Meetup is about is saying, ‘I want to run more, I want to go to writing meetups.'”

You may not have heard much from Meetup recently, but Heiferman said the service has grown to 25 million members. He also said the company is profitable — browsing the listings is free, but meetup organizers have to pay a subscription fee.
Heiferman contrasted the Meetup approach with companies like Facebook that are investing in virtual reality.
“We say, fuck VR,” he said. “Let’s really invest, let’s use AI to invent an IRL experience that is something special.”",2016-09-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/arts.jpg?w=738,"scott-heiferman,meetup",Meetup redesigns its mobile apps to focus on your personal interests
204,Sarah Perez,"Finally, finally, Twitter has rolled out a version of its storytelling feature called Moments that it should have released at launch. Today, the company says that it’s opening up the Moments platform so anyone can create their own stories using tweets and photos uploaded to the service.
We already knew this day was coming: in August, Twitter expanded access to Moments to also include a broader set of influencers and brands. It promised also it would make Moments a consumer-facing feature in the “coming months.”
Moments, by way of background, was previously code-named Project Lightning. It first launched a year ago as an effort to give people another reason to use Twitter, in light of challenges with stalling user growth. The feature brought to mind the short-form content that’s now popular elsewhere on mobile, like Snapchat’s Stories, for example.
Of course, it’s somewhat odd that Moments wasn’t a user-facing feature from day one. There’s already such a need for a way to aggregate collections of tweets into a cohesive story, that third parties like Storify stepped in long ago with their own tools for the task.
Plus, by way of crowdsourcing, Twitter could have tapped into other ongoing trends like “tweetstorms” (longer thoughts told as a series of tweets), and shifted those to Moments, potentially increasing clicks and engagement numbers. User-facing Moments could even have led to viral hits or memes. (Perhaps, those will still come about now that the tool is open to anyone.)
To create your own Moment, you’ll click into the new “Moments” tab on your profile.
Here you’ll find a collection of the Moments you’ve already created, alongside a button to create a new one. The tool lets you set a “Cover” using photos or videos from tweets, or an image of your choosing. Afterwards, you can find tweets to add in a variety of ways.
You can pull tweets from your favorites (“Tweets I’ve liked”), by account, via a Twitter search, or you can add them directly using the tweet’s link. The interface looks to be a lot quicker than using Storify’s creation tools, as it turns out. And when you’re finished, you can share your Moment via tweet. Others can then flip through your Moment right on Twitter, or embed it elsewhere on the web.
Moments is rolling out now for everyone, and Twitter has also released a how-to guide – as a Moment, naturally – to help you get started.
Correction: Twitter was called Project Lightning; TechCrunch joked it should be Glacier. Wrote wrong codename by accident, but updated with correct one after publication. ",2016-09-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-28-at-12-45-04-pm.png?w=738,"social,moments",Twitter finally lets everyone create their own “Moments”
205,Josh Constine,"Facebook is ready to make work as addictive as socializing. The company plans to launch its enterprise communication and collaboration network Facebook At Work in the next few weeks on a per seat pricing model, The Information (paywall) first reported and a source close to Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch.
Facebook believes it can keep individual employees engaged with the product, so it’s betting on a pricing plan that charges companies “per monthly active user” instead of charging a flat rate per company, says Facebook @ Work director Julien Codorniou. TechCrunch has learned that Facebook will announce launch integrations or partnerships with other SaaS tool providers including Asana. [Disclosure: I’m friends with Asana’s co-founders.]
That could make it lucrative for Facebook to get every single member of a company signed up, from executives to assistants. And if the product doesn’t stick, employers won’t have to pay for empty seats.
TechCrunch originally reported that Facebook was building the enterprise product back in 2014, and it officially unveiled the first tests at the start of 2015. Since then, Facebook’s been busy signing up huge international customers, like the 100,000-employee Royal Bank Of Scotland.
Facebook At Work subscribers can use the product’s special “Work Feed” of posts from colleagues to exchange ideas and assume tasks. It’s reminiscent of products like Convo ($9/month), Salesforce Chatter ($15/month), and Microsoft’s Yammer ($3-$24/month). Facebook At Work will also offer Groups as well as Messenger, which includes audio and video calling options that could compete with Slack and Skype. Plus it provides the social network’s profiles, Events and Live video features.
The exact price for Facebook At Work hasn’t been announced, but the 400-plus beta testers who’ve been using it for free will get a few additional months of comped subscriptions to test it out. For reference, Slack charges $6.67 per active user, but only offers real-time messaging tools, and lacks a feed for posting tasks and questions that don’t need to live forever in a wiki, but shouldn’t get buried in chat.
Facebook At Work’s biggest strength could be its familiarity. It should find onboarding users easier than many SaaS tools since people will already have a login, password, and know how to use it. That quick registration could help it leapfrog competitors that can often seem foreign or confusing compared to consumer software. If a customer prefers it for security purposes, employees can also set up entirely separate accounts for business.
The launch will come just as Microsoft scraps the Yammer Enterprise tier many companies rely on, who might be looking for a new way to keep the whole team on the same page. Diversifying its revenue streams beyond advertising could help Facebook boost its bottom line without drowning its consumer users in marketing.
Facebook will just have to conquer the stigma that it’s for fooling around, not getting work done.

206,Natasha Lomas,"Facebook has been ordered to stop harvesting the data of WhatsApp users in Germany.
The move follows the latter’s shock announcement last month that it would start sharing user data with its parent company, Facebook, including users’ phone numbers and last seen time in the app. Stated uses for the data includes marketing/ad targeting.
Shock because, back at the time of the $19BN acquisition, WhatsApp’s founder publicly stated that nothing would change for users of the ad-free messaging platform as a result of selling to the social network giant. Full marks if you didn’t believe a word of it at the time.
But reneging on such public statement looks to be what’s got the two into hot water in Hamburg now, with the city’s data protection authority describing the resulting situation as both misleading for users and a breach of national data protection law.
The Hamburg DPA is able to issue a national order against Facebook’s business in Germany because the company has a branch office located in the city.
In a statement today, data protection commissioner Johannes Caspar ordered Facebook to delete any data it has already harvested from Germany’s 35 million WhatsApp users, and to stop collecting more — asserting that Facebook has not obtained permission from WhatsApp users for connecting their accounts.
He also accused Facebook of harvesting millions of phone numbers, via WhatsApp users’ contact lists, of people who might be neither a Facebook nor a WhatsApp user.
Last month WhatsApp users were pushed a notification of updated terms and conditions for the app, and agreeing to them default opted users in to sharing data with Facebook. Although a more careful reader of the T&Cs might have noticed there was a toggle at the end which could be switched to opt out of sharing data with Facebook for marketing/ad targeting purposes.
“The arrangement protects the data of about 35 million WhatsApp users in Germany. It has to be their respective decision whether they want to connect their account with Facebook. This requires Facebook to ask permission beforehand. This has not happened,” he said (translated from German via Google Translate).
“In addition there are many millions of people whose contact details were uploaded from the address books of users WhatsApp, without requiring them to have something to do with Facebook or WhatsApp.
“This enormous amount of data, Facebook has not yet been collected by his own admission. The response from Facebook that this is simply not yet taken place at the time, however, gives cause for concern that the extent of the data breach even more massive impact will lead to. ”
Facebook has said it intends to appeal the order.
In a statement provided to TechCrunch in response to the action, a spokesperson for the company said: “Facebook complies with EU data protection law. We will appeal this order and will work with the Hamburg DPA in an effort to address their questions and resolve any concerns.”
This is not the only headache for the WhatsApp-Facebook data-sharing deal in Europe, which has a different data protection regime than the U.S. — a factor that has derailed other Facebook moves (such as leading it to turn off a facial recognition-powered tagging feature in the region back in 2012).
The shift to Facebook cross-referencing WhatsApp user data and app analytics with other services it owns and operates has also caught the attention of the UK’s ICO data protection watchdog — which last month said it was looking into whether the two companies were being transparent with users about how their data is being shared and used.
In a general statement earlier this month the Article 29 Working Party, the European body that represents the collective views of the DPAs of the 28 Member State of the EU, said: “Users should keep control of their data when Internet giants massively compile it.”
It added that it and each national DPA “closely monitor any privacy policy changes”.",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/fb-whatsapp1.png?w=738,"data-protection,privacy",Facebook ordered to stop harvesting data on WhatsApp users in Germany
207,Sarah Perez,"Although the iMessage App Store is currently dominated by sticker packs, there are a few clever apps breaking through. One such app is Momento, an iMessage-only app that automatically turns your photos from your Camera Roll into GIFs you can text to your friends. What makes the new app fun to use is that it doesn’t require that you do anything to create these GIFs yourself – it does that for you.
The app scans your photo library to figure out which photos will make good GIFs, then makes them available for sharing with just a tap.
Momento’s creator, Genady Okrain, says he wanted to build something that encourage people to go back to revisit their photo memories.
“As an amateur photographer, I have a lot of experience with photography. I’ve been amazed to see just how many photos people take,” he explains.
“All those photos are on people’s devices but no one is looking back on all of them. Momento creates cool GIFs from those photos and that help people remember those old moments,” says Okrain.

Using the app is simple. After downloading it from the iMessage App Store, you just tap the app when you want to add a GIF to your text message. Momento displays GIFs it has created for you to choose from.
It also groups these GIFs for easy access, with your most recent moments at the top of the screen. As you scroll down, you’ll find other GIFs organized into albums that mirror those in the Photos app. For example, there are sections for Favorites, Selfies, Bursts, and then an “All” group at the bottom.
To send a GIF, you just tap it and it’s added right into your text message. All you have to do is hit “Send.”
Okrain has released a handful of photo and navigation iOS apps on the App Store in the past, but this is his first iMessage application.
Of course, the iMessage App Store is still getting off the ground, so the app has seen limited downloads so far. iOS 10 is only on roughly 40% of devices, and not all of those who have upgraded to the new OS are even aware that Apple’s iMessage App Store exists at this point.
That said, Momento has already managed to snag some 800 downloads, despite being a paid application, and has since scanned around 10 million photos, says Okrain.
Although it’s $1.99 download, Momento is worth the price, as you’ll likely use this app a ton going forward. You can find the app here in the iMessage App Store.",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/momento.jpg?w=738,"imessage-apps,ios-apps,apps,momento",Momento for iMessage turns your photos into GIFs
208,Josh Constine,"If you combined the fastest and slowest types of social media, the result could be both must-see and never-forgotten.
YouTube lacks short-form, frequently updated content, but is synonymous with video and that popularity brings in lucrative ads. Twitter is struggling with growth and monetization, but it’s the pulse of the planet, generating tons of real-time content and engagement.
Together they could be a powerful team if Google’s willing to pay the price, which Kara Swisher reports could be around $30 billion.
Twitter is also in talks with Verizon, Salesforce, and Microsoft, TechCrunch reported following a story by CNBC about Twitter’s interest in selling out. And Disney is considering a bid too.
But of all those potential acquirers, Google seems like the best fit. It has products that would mesh well with Twitter. It’s proven unable to build its own successful social products beyond its acquisition of YouTube. And it has its insanely profitable search advertising business to support the financially unstable Twitter.
Google would get to further its goal of organizing the world’s information by ingesting Twitter’s data firehose, which could give Google’s AI extra insights into what’s going on in the world and everyone’s reactions. Plus it might be able to monetize all that data better by combining Twitter with everything Google knows from AdWords and AdSense.
But the best synergy lies in uniting YouTube’s sporadic video content with Twitter’s constant chatter. A strong integration into YouTube could  increase the frequency of return visits to the channels of content creators by offering a one-stop-shop for fandom, encompassing off-the-cuff tweets and polished videos.
And it just so happens that YouTube recently built its own Twitter-style feature called YouTube Community that it could replace with the real thing.
YouTube Community is a sidebar/tab for YouTube Channels that lets creators share text, photos, GIFs, links, and more to stoke a deeper form of connection with their viewers. The strategy is to get users to come back to those channels more often than just when the creator publishes a new video, which might only be once or twice a week. With all of YouTube’s algorithmic suggestions, it could then get those visitors to watch other new videos or older ones by their favorite stars.
That would allow YouTube to better compete with Facebook, which has built an enormous audience for spontaneous video discovery. Users come to the News Feed to see what’s up with friends, but end up watching random videos. That gives Facebook lots of opportunities to serve high-priced video ads, since users weren’t trying to watch something specific anyways. YouTube has historically been more of purposeful viewing destination that users visit because they followed a link to a certain video or wanted to see the latest clip from creators they follow.
Meanwhile, Twitter could dramatically benefit from exposure to YouTube’s mainstream and teen audiences. Many people are still confused about why they would want to sign up for Twitter, especially if they’re not a public figure and might not be able to build a big audience for their tweets. But YouTube could teach them the joys of Twitter lurking, where users follow stars or thought leaders and perhaps reply, but don’t necessarily have to produce original tweets.

An acquisition by Google would also take the pressure off Twitter to monetize directly, which hasn’t been going well with revenue growth sinking fast. Many of Twitter’s ad units, like Sponsored Tweets, feel easily skippable.
People already skim rather than meticulously read their Twitter timeline, making it easier to pass by the ads than ones on Facebook, where algorithmic sorting and a focus on real friends encourages people to read each post — and the ads in between. Twitter’s best performing ads are videos, and YouTube’s experience and advertiser connections could give them a boost.
In any case, something has to change for Twitter. Except for investors trying to capitalize on a potential sale, its share price has sunk lower and lower. Each earnings report has seemed more hopeless than the last as a user growth problem has festered into a revenue growth problem. Some fresh management and cross-promotion from a proven tech giant like Google could mend its wings.",2016-09-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/google-acquires-twitter.png?w=738,,"If Google buys Twitter, there’s a perfect spot for it in YouTube"
209,Natasha Lomas,"Is Facebook having —
Answers in the comments, please. Additional suggestions also welcome.
I ask because Facebook is surveying users to ask whether they think it cares about them.
Yes, it is literally using the word “cares”.
The survey, which Facebook says is being pushed to “a small group of people”, includes questions probing for users’ strength of feeling about Facebook (positive or negative), before asking them to elaborate on why they feel that way.
One possible response here reads: “It does not protect my personal information.”
Another: “It does not give me control over what I see on Facebook and who sees what I post.”
A third: “It has too many advertisements.”
Other questions ask respondents to select from a list which items they think best show Facebook “cares” about them, and vice versa, with pre-filled responses here including privacy controls and data security; user support/offensive content reporting; News Feed; and messages/chat, to name a few.
One amusingly meta question asks users to qualify where exactly they are directing their negative and/or positive feelings: Facebook as a company, as an app/site, or Facebook as a collection of other humans (“Facebook users”).
It’s a teeny glimpse into the quasi-psychological burden of being the go-to user generated content platform cum social communication network for one billion+ people all over the planet.
I’ve embedded a gallery of screenshots of some of the survey questions below, if you’re curious to see the full lists, and what else Facebook is asking (and how it asks it) — at least covering what’s asked if you follow the path of responding with a negative to its initial question about whether it cares.
At the end of the survey Facebook says it will use the feedback to “help improve Facebook”.
And improve it sure needs to.
Multiple items in its list of possible responses immediately bring to mind a raft of recent Facebook-related controversies — whether it’s high level moves to further undermine user privacy; baffling content censorship decisions (yet tardiness combating the spread of hate speech); an ad infested News Feed that’s been guilty of algorithmically encouraging clickbait (and worse); and the largescale shuttering of mobile web access to Facebook messages to try to drive more downloads of Facebook’s Messenger app (at the expense of letting users access messages how they please — something TC columnist Jon Evans memorably dubbed “malevolent design“), to name just a very few.
Point is, when you’re a one billion+ user content sharing platform that’s principally engineered to algorithmically rank information to generate the most ad views from your users, while simultaneously leveraging your massive user-base to consume other media distribution channels, intent on becoming the primary means for all media distribution globally, well, you’re not going to be able to step away from the political hot seat. No matter many times you try to claim you’re just a tech tool, not a media company.
So really it’s hard to know which reputation damaging controversy Facebook is fretting about the most here. If indeed concern about negative PR is its motivation for running this survey. (I’ve asked Facebook for comment on its intentions with the poll and will update this post with any response.)
But here’s another possibility: Facebook is hoping to quantify whether Zuck’s personal brand of positive PR can beat back the tide of negative Facebook news.
Notably, one question in the survey makes specific reference to the past week — and asks whether a user’s opinion of Facebook has changed for the better, stayed the same or dialed down over this period.
Again there’s no mention of which specific event/events it’s fishing for a response to here. So what might Facebook be thinking about?
Let’s see…
Last Wednesday there was the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s announcement of a $3BN investment it said it intends to make over the next 10 years, with the headline-grabbing goal of ‘curing, preventing or managing all human disease’.
So perhaps Facebook is hoping its founder’s philanthropic side-line business, via the Limited Liability Company he and his wife announced as the vehicle for 99% of their Facebook stock to at the end of last year, can be used to pop a halo atop Facebook’s overall reputation — warming users’ hearts with the thought that the platform giant is not just destroying their privacy and micro-managing the world’s attention with woefully inept algorithms designed to sell ads rather than understand cultural context — it’s also trying to cure cancer!
In other words, hello $3BN worth of positive PR.
But how far one positive PR story — however ambitiously framed and generously self funded — can stretch to ‘reputation wash’ a tech giant whose command over information and attention spans has scaled so gigantic it has, in all likelihood, the democracy-crushing ability to swing votes and sway elections, as well as the amply demonstrated capacity to spread misinformation, hate speech and even spark or inflame large-scale violence remains to be seen.
A content platform giant that, in addition, continues to take a serious beasting for the terribly poor editorial decisions it makes to promote, demote or disappear entirely the information and human stories that flow across its servers. And for the knock on effect these decisions have on the populations and societies consuming increasing quantities of news via Facebook’s massive media portal.
But hey, just so long as you don’t call Facebook a media company!
(Oh and hey look! — the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is currently hiring a chief spokesperson to ramp up the quantity of good news stories spinning out of the LLP, and eke more value out of the cash mountain of tax sheltered Facebook profits that funds it. “Experience in crisis communications” is one of the listed responsibilities for the role… )
Turns out a week is a very long time in Facebook negative headlines. Here’s just a few examples from a quick search of Facebook-related news this past week…

Facebook’s Bad Year Just Got a Lot Worse
And just in case you’re thinking this week might be an outlier on the Facebook bad news front, the week before wasn’t exactly free of PR-headaches for the tech giant either…
e.g.
Facebook to roll out tech for combating fake stories in its Trending topics
Europe’s top court to weigh in on Facebook privacy ‘class action’
Facebook employees say deleting ‘napalm girl’ photo was a mistake
etc, etc.
Safe to say, there is an increasingly shrill tone to Zuckerberg’s protestations that the global content platform he commands, which pumps a daily digest of news, information and entertainment into the screens on its 1BN+ users, is not a media company.
“We are a tech company, not a media company,” he said recently, responding to a journalist’s question about whether Facebook intends to become a news editor.
“We build the tools, we do not produce any content,” he added.
Well, either he’s never heard the phrase the medium is the message. Or he’s intentionally dodging the bullet and watching as it slams into the body politic.
Facebook is very obviously not just a tech tool, and to claim otherwise is disingenuous and downright dangerous — as others have eloquently argued. The mega platform that Facebook now commands is not just dabbling with data, it’s shaping people’s lives and lived experience.
Move fast and break things may not be the official company motto anymore, but Facebook needs to do a lot more than run the odd concerned user survey if it wants to demonstrate it’s outgrown its previously stated cavalier attitude to the wider repercussions of its actions.
If Facebook really wants to show it cares about the people subject to the power of its platform then it needs to stop trying to engineer around the one thing it can’t shirk: editorial responsibility. And recognize that it needs human editors, not just algorithms and moderators.
Here’s another phrase Facebook should really ink onto its whiteboards: the personal is political.
Otherwise Zuck can carry on funneling a portion of his vast personal wealth into feel-good philanthropy projects in the hopes a halo glow of enough positive headlines will be able to outweigh the constant stream of negative news underlining quite how much power Facebook is irresponsibly wielding.
But does he really think curing cancer is easier than accepting editorial responsibility?

210,Josh Constine,"Unless you plan on bumping into stuff, don’t expect to record after-dark concerts and parties on your Snap Inc Spectacles. The company formerly known as Snapchat (they really should have just changed it to the 👻 emoji, Prince-style) confirms to me its new camera glasses are not currently built to be worn at night. Their lenses are like normal sunglasses, so it’d be too shady to see with them on.
This fact reinforces the idea of Spectacles as “a toy”. That’s how Snap CEO Evan Spiegel referred to them while talking to the Wall Street Journal, which never mentioned they’re for day-use only.

When the $130 Specs are released this fall, you might have to stick to barbecues and day-time music festivals when you want to tap the rim of your glasses to record 10 seconds of circular, first-person video.
Perhaps future iterations could come with clear lenses or photochromatic light-adaptive lenses that are dark in the sun and transparent at night or indoors. By ditching extra functionality to keep the price reasonable, Snapchat may be able to market the glasses as an aspirational buy for its teen user base. That will go smoother if it can align Spectacles with celebrities people want to emulate.

The first version of Spectacles might not be as transformational of a technology as some hoped. Yet it gives Snapchat more control of the image capture and saving experience. With time, engineering, and product finesse, Specs could evolve into something we see ourselves wearing whenever we go somewhere we want to share.
But if public perception lumps them in with geeky Google Glass or unnecessary Flipcams, Spiegel will have spent a lot of Snap’s $2 billion-plus in venture capital on something just for him to play with.

211,John Mannes,"The Twittersphere was just a little bit quieter this morning after Marc Andreessen, father of the Tweetstorm, vacated the platform last night. While there’s no clear answer from him or others as to why he decided to take a break, Andreessen is not the first popular Silicon Valley figure to abruptly leave the service.

Earlier this summer, Sam Altman, President of the Y Combinator Group, left citing community issues on the Twitter platform. He argued that the social network “rewards negativity and snark,” and that he felt “worse after using Twitter.”
Unlike Altman, Andreessen didn’t leave a Tweetstorm explaining his exit, but it is possible that many of the same reasons could have temporarily driven him off the platform. Right now the only Tweets visible on his profile are a four word post about taking a break and a retweet about neoliberalism but when Andreessen was Tweeting on all four burners, he regularly contributed to contentious political debates with other users.
Of course, even Altman couldn’t resist the urge to come back to Twitter after a brief absence. Given Andreessen described his actions as a “break,” it will likely end much in the same way with an eventual return. Twitter as a platform has increasingly come under fire for its dismissive approach to the toxic culture permitting from some of the site’s insensitive and trolling users, though Andreessen isn’t usually one to back away from divisive conversations.
You could also speculate that Andreessen wanted some of his old tweeted viewpoints to disappear, but at this point it’s highly unlikely. If there was something buried in his feed that he was afraid of, he wouldn’t be able to remove it from the internet just by wiping his account — though removing it from his personal profile would certainly make it less likely to surface.  The internet is full of bots that are set up to retweet every single one of his tweets. Even software couldn’t eat all of Marc Andreessen’s Tweets out there in the world.
These same bots could also provide an explanation for why Andreessen deleted all of his posts but a single odd retweet. From looking at the bots, it doesn’t appear the retweet was posted anytime close to last nights events. The original creator of the Tweet noted much the same and that the cause could have been bug relating to a previously deactivated profile.
The existence of Andreessen bots also means that this poor fellow can continue his PhD thesis.
When we reached out to his firm about why Andreessen deleted the tweets, they replied that it was “just a break from Twitter”.",2016-09-25,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-604311102.jpg?w=738,"computing,information-technology,business,andreessen","Marc Andreessen suddenly deletes all his tweets, goes on Twitter break"
212,Matt Klein,"

It has been declared that Twitter has an abuse problem. Whether it was the Milo and Leslie Jones fiasco, the scathing BuzzFeed article or the unveiling of the platform’s own Quality Filter, many are blue in the face from yelling at the platform.
However, blaming Twitter is a narrow-minded argument and a misunderstanding of the true problem at hand. By no means is Twitter faultless, as there is certainly room to grow by solidifying a stance between free speech and censorship. This is a difficult process that platforms such as Facebook and YouTube have gone through before, and still are experiencing. No network is immune, and no one has discovered the perfect balance, even if it existed.
Twitter did not give birth to cyberbullying, nor will they abolish it. Online abuse is omnipresent and not exclusive to one platform over another. It’s a behavior that starts with a mentality, not a platform. Attacking Twitter for its policing or lack thereof does not attack the root of the problem. Even if Twitter ceased to exist tomorrow, online harassment will not expire.
A bully is a bully and a troll is a troll, no matter where you go online. For as long as online mass communication has existed, from the early days of AOL chat rooms, online bullying has existed. So, in order to effectively address the issue of cyberbullying, one must not only question the environments that yield such behaviors, but examine how and why the behavior exists in the first place.
The ability to hide behind not only a screen, and often an unidentifiable name or avatar, unquestionably leaves online harassment to prevail. Whether one’s absolutely anonymous or not, the reduction of faceless communication disallows immediate, raw or physical reactions and consequences.
Infamously stated, “On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” While the comic was originally printed in The New Yorker in July 1993, the claim never rang more true than it does today. You are faceless online. While publications recently touted a study that found “trolls are even more hostile when they’re using their real names,” the support in favor of the counter argument “anonymity promotes online bullying” is far more prevalent, substantial and logical.
With this in mind, one possible counteraction to Twitter’s predicament would be to restore the faces from faceless communication. When verification and accountability exists, it can be presumed that harmful behaviors such as abuse and trolling will curb. However, is this a step in the right direction?
Twitter’s problem is very real indeed, but the implications and possible solutions for this platform are apart of a much larger discussion pertaining to all human-connected developments. Going forward, we need to ask which directions we’d first like to head in. As Jonathan Zittrain, the co-founder of Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, states in Werner Herzog’s film Lo and Behold, “We can design systems that are really anonymous or that are utterly identifiable down to the person, and it’s time for us to think about what contexts we’d want to support what.”

While promoting his latest film, Lo and Behold, Werner Herzog claimed, “The internet is not good or evil, or dark or light-hearted, it’s humans.” This resonates quite well with Twitter. What we end up imagining, producing and enabling online ultimately materializes the reflection of the human collection.
So at the end of the day when we point at a platform like Twitter, which many believe should be held responsible for cyberbullying, we’re accusing inherently innocent defendants. In reality, we should be pointing at ourselves.",2016-09-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-173003430.jpg?w=738,"trolling,trolls,cyberbullying",We’re looking at cyberbullying the wrong way
213,John Mannes,"The art of the lip sync has had a profound impact on the state of our…ok no, but dammit is lip synching fun.
For those of you locked in a Faraday cage, pretending to sing has become all the rage these days. You have Michelle Obama doing it for Carpool Karaoke, Tim Cook using it to open up events, and of course the ever entertaining LL Cool J and Chrissy Teigen using it as a platform for the Spike series, Lip Sync Battle. On the show, celebrities battle each other by pretending to sing songs with dramatic effect. With a new app, anyone can now jam out in battles with their friends.
It’s quite hard to go wrong with such a fun starting point, and for the most part, the app’s creators Wurrly, Spike TV, and Casey Patterson Entertainment, don’t let us down. Upon opening the app and selecting create, users are presented with a list of genres including pop, rock, rap, country, classics, and latin. There are also themed categories like love songs and a special section for tracks coming from prior Lip Sync Battles. Once you pick a song, the next step is to get to work recording.
Rather than just straight recording on top of an audio track like in Dubsmash, songs are accompanied with lyrics to make it possible to record in one take. Users can also select a number of accessories that serve a similar purpose as lenses in Snapchat. You can go for a crazy glasses vibe, a cat ears look, and even a full flower child outfit. 
Wurrly did most of the development of the accessories and facial tracking in house. The groundwork has already been laid alongside another company called Facio to do emotional recognition. This means that in the future, tattoos, masks and other accessories will be able to alter their appearance based on your emotional state. If you’re singing a sad verse in a ballad, a mask could animate differently than during the power hook of a pop song.
“Our intention was really to create a world of fun,” said Nadine Levitt, CEO of Wurrly.
At the end of filming your epic production, there is a list of post processing effects you can choose from to put the final touches on a battle. This includes things like confetti intros, lights and pyro effects.
Apps that license songs often struggle to build up and maintain a healthy and attractive music catalog. Levitt cites a relationship with Universal Music Group as one of the key factors that helped to get the licensing process off the ground. The starting library is diverse and even includes a number of country songs that haven’t garnered much attention on the show itself. Levitt sees the app as a way to continue to build the Lip Sync Battle community.
To generate revenue, Wurrly will be offering specialty items to its community at a price. This could include limited addition effects and masks. Because the app has such a strong relationship with a real world show generating new content every week, Lip Sync Battle can also benefit by leveraging promotional content to boost fan engagement.
The early version of the app works pretty smoothly although one drawback is that creations are tied to the app itself. You can share them for battles and link videos on social media, but they ultimately pull you back into the app. Synching between lyrics and music was also an issue in a few instances. Lyrics for the Eminem and Rihanna track Love the Way You Lie seemed oddly timed, and in one case, the lyrics for the Lynyrd Skynyrd hit Free Bird were incorrect. These were all relatively minor quips and will hopefully be fixed by the time heavy traffic starts battling.
If you’re not already into the craze, the premise of lip syncing may seem about as odd as watching American Idol on mute while listening to the track on Spotify. However, there is something special about a nonjudgemental space where you can truly step away and not care about anything other than having fun with your friends. I spent about an hour after 5pm on a Friday making the gem below in the TechCrunch offices. I can’t completely say there was no office judgement, but as promised, it surely was a world of fun.

214,Ingrid Lunden,"The world of sunglasses may be long in the cool stakes but has up to now been somewhat short on innovation. Now, the winds of technology are shifting those sands.
You may have heard already about Snap (née Snapchat) turning the not-so-humble pair of 80s-style retro shades into a device for recording and posting videos on Snapchat. Now, at the other end of the spectrum, a startup out of Spain called Saldum Ventures has raised $56 million (€50 million) to build out Hawkers, a new, digital-first, vertically integrated sunglasses business that wants to take on the big brands of the industry like Ray-Ban, Oakley and more.
This is the first funding that Hawkers has raised since it first opened for business two years ago. This round was led by Félix Ruiz and Hugo Arévalo, the founders of Tuenti, a social networking app in Spain that was acquired by Telefonica and has since expanded into other mobile services like calls. Others investing include O’Hara, an investment group controlled by Venezuelan businessman Alejandro Betancourt, as well as other private investors that are not being named.
The company is not disclosing its valuation, but it tells me that it is a minority investment that retains control with the startup’s co-founders: Alex Moreno (CEO), Paco Pérez (GM), Pablo Sánchez (CMO) and David Moreno (Creative Director). Pérez said that Hawkers is currently seeing an annual turnover of €70 million ($78 million) and is already profitable and projecting revenues of €150 million in 2017 and €300 million in 2018. As a point of comparison, the U.S. startup Warby Parker, which has raised over $200 million, was last year valued at $1.2 billion and is still unprofitable.
While there are a number of companies like Snap that are approaching sunglasses as yet another piece of wearable, connected hardware, this is not the area where Hawkers is hoping to make its mark (not yet, anyway).
For now, the company actually has a fairly reductive model: it focuses on one style and brings variation in by way of a seemingly endless combination of lens and frame colors, include collaborations with famous personalities and brands to produce specific styles. Collaborators have so far included the LA Lakers, retailer Pull&Bear, Mercedes-Benz, PlayStation, Steve Aoki, Usher, Jorge Lorenzo, Luis Suarez, Lewis Hamilton and Ricky Rubio.

Hawkers then designs the glasses itself and works with a small number of producers — across China, Italy and Spain — to make them. To date about 90% of its sales come directly to the consumer from its site (it’s sold 3.5 million pairs to date in 50 countries). Occasionally, it also partners with retailers that also cater to their younger demographic.
That younger demographic also forms the basis of Hawkers itself. The average age of an employee is 27, and in keeping with that, the company is comfortably millennial in its approach.
“We don’t take ourselves too seriously, and we think that is a good thing. Hawkers represents the new generation of companies,” David Moreno, the creative director told me. Like others in that generation, Hawkers takes a lot of cues from its audience of mostly younger customers in terms of what to produce. “We are not the owners of the brand. We just manage the brand. Our customers who continue buying our brand are the owners.”
It’s mantra is that the days of having to choose between design and price, or quality and price, or trendy and price, are over, with all models costing between €25 and €30.
It also spends virtually no money on marketing (maybe because it needed to pool it all its sponsorship of the LA Lakers). “All our communications and branding is in social media, which we see a huge tool to convert clients to fans and fans to clients,” Pérez said. “That’s the right and only place for us to be.”
The company plans to use the funding to continue expanding across Europe — Italy, Germany, Australia, France, Portugal and the United Kingdom — as well as launch physical concept stores in key locations. And there will be some put aside for R&D Pérez, told me.
“We are going to invest in R&D to study new materials, but also new ways to make market ourselves online, and new acquisitions,” he said. “Of course, we would like to be the brand of the future transforming the way we buy sunglasses.”
Down that line, that might also mean extending their business smarts into smart eyewear, and interestingly could open up interesting collaborations down the line both for Hawkers and those making some of the underlying wearable technology. “We love what Snapchat is doing,” Pérez said. “We would love to make something with them.”",2016-10-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-04-at-12-49-48.png?w=738,"spain,eyewear,sunglasses",Spain’s sunglasses startup Hawkers nabs $56M to take on the Ray-Bans of the world
215,Steve O'Hear,"Source{d} provides an interesting use-case for AI. The Spain-headquartered startup, which today is announcing $6 million in Series A funding, is using deep learning to help startups and larger companies recruit developers. Specifically, its AI tech is analysing the code of millions of developers via their open source contributions in order to match them to appropriate job openings.
“We use this analysis to understand how good they are at any given language and framework and match them with companies looking for developers,” is how Source{d} co-founder and COO Jorge Schnura explains it.
He also says it isn’t just about identifying code quality or a developer’s ability, but also coding style and other nuances that differentiates one developer from another. And it’s this aspect that benefits from a “deep neural network” approach.
“We can [find] people who are similar to your team,” adds Schnura. “This is all unsupervised learning since we don’t tell our algorithms which features to look for, it defines them itself”.
Meanwhile, the company, which is only in its second year of operation, say it’s already close to being profitable and on track to close the year something approaching €1 million in revenue. It claims 200 clients ranging from small to medium-sized startups, right up to a number of corporates.
Backing Source{d}’s Series A round are three European investment funds: Xavier Niel’s own fund, Otium Venture, and Sunstone Capital. The company already has offices in Madrid and Berlin, and says the new capital will be used to expand to London, Paris, Stockholm, Amsterdam, New York, Boston and San Francisco.
It also plans to further develop its product, including applying its AI-driven analysis of code to other products aimed at developers, both free and paid-for.

216,Steve O'Hear,"“FINE WINE RETAILER TANNICO QUAFFS €3.8M IN SERIES A FUNDING,” screams the press release, conjuring up an image of a startup spending all of its newly acquired cash on one giant Dot Com-fueled booze up. Sadly (or luckily for the company’s new backers), this story isn’t that!
Founded by ex-VC Marco Magnocavallo, Tannico is a classic ‘Long Tail’ retail play, matching disparate supply (including wines from smaller wineries) with demand, thus bringing the antiquated fine wine market in Europe online.
It also claims to employ “big data and artificial intelligence” tech to build a “unique taste DNA” of each customer and provide personalised wine recommendations via a feature it calls an “Automated Sommelier”. That sounds a lot like a fancy way of describing a recommendation engine to me. But what do I know…
“After selling Blogo to RCS Media Group and being a VC for several years, I again needed the stress and vibrant energy that only a new startup can guarantee,” Magnocavallo told me in an email. “Having already founded an e-commerce company in the early 2000s, I was intrigued to start a new retail business but in a different vertical”.
Tellingly, he says he chose wine based on two different but strong factors: Italy is the first or second largest wine producer in the world with more than 100,000 wineries, and the Italian online wine market was at only 0.2 per cent penetration and had “huge opportunities of growth in the next few years”. Classic VC thinking that appears to be panning out.
Launched in 2012, Milan-headquartered Tannico already claims a 15 per cent share of the Italian market, stocking over 6,000 wines from over 1,000 wineries. Last year it sold 250,000 bottles of wine to a total of 40,000 customers. Beyond Italy, the company plans to enter the UK market next followed by Switzerland and France.
Meanwhile, Italian VC P101 led today’s Series A, with participation from private investors Matteo de Brabant (founder of Jakala), Maurizio di Robilant (founder of Robilant Associati, described as the Italian market leader in brand advisory and design) and Stefano Saccardi (Board member and managing director at Campari).",2016-10-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/marco-magnocavallo.jpg?w=738,,Wine retailer Tannico “quaffs” €3.8M Series A
217,Natasha Lomas,"Alphabet (née Google) has been given yet another extension to file its respond to charges in Europe that it has misused the dominance of its Android mobile platform to lock out competition by promoting its own services over and above others.
Reuters reported the extension today, which gives the company until the last day of this month to file its rebuttal, and follows another extension last month — at the time touted as Google’s last — which pushed the deadline from September 7 to September 20. The original EC deadline for Google’s response was in April so we’re heading for six months later already at this stage (meanwhile the EC’s initial probe of Android complaints dates back to April 2015).
That said, it is common for competition investigations to involve extensions, although — from the complainant point of view — the risk is of the issue being kicked so far into the long glass that any corrective measures come too late.
In the case of the Android antitrust probe, which has focused on complaints that Google uses the OS as a ‘trojan horse’ to embed its own apps and services into smartphone devices at the expense of rivals’, there’s a very real risk of a substantially negative outcome for Google’s business in Europe. Alphabet could face a fine of up to 10 per cent of its annual turnover — which is close to $75BN — if the EC antitrust charges are upheld against it.
At the weekend Reuters reported the EC is preparing to fine the company in the Android probe — citing a charge sheet it had seen, although it did not provide details of the size of the impending fine.
The charge sheet also apparently includes an EC instruction to Google to cease making payments to smartphone makers as an incentive to pre-install its apps.
A spokesperson for the antitrust department declined to comment on those claims but did confirm the latest extensions to the deadlines — which not only cover the Android antitrust investigation but also two other ongoing EC probes of Alphabet/Google services: namely its price comparison service Google Shopping and its AdSense business.
Google now has until October 13 to send the EC its response to the Google Shopping charges, and October 26 to file its response to AdSense.
“In each of these cases, Google asked for additional time to review the documents in the case file. In line with normal practice, the commission analysed the reasons for the request and granted an extension allowing Google to fully exercise its rights of defence,” said Commission spokesperson Ricardo Cardoso in a statement.
There have now been four deadline extensions in all in the Android antitrust investigation, and one apiece for AdSense and Shopping.
The fact Google is having to respond to three investigations simultaneously is likely working in its favor when it comes to obtaining extensions.
The current deadlines in each case means the time for Google to reply, i.e. from the moment the EC issued a formal statement of objections, currently stands at 13 weeks for Shopping; 15 weeks for AdSense; and 27 weeks for Android — although of course there may yet be further extensions.
Reuters also suggested the EC might fine Google in the Shopping probe, citing another charge sheet it has seen. According to its report it’s also possible Google may also be asked to rank rival comparison shopping services in the same way as its own services — with the EC reportedly set to decide later whether it would allow Google to charge competitors for displaying their services prominently.
But again, there’s no official confirmation from the EC at this stage.
Google also recently lost an appeal in the Russian courts over a similar complaint relating to how it operates its Android OS in that market — including how it bundles its apps with the Google Play store; requirements that its OEMs preinstall its Google search engine by default; and give its app icons preferential placement on the first screen of handsets.
Over the summer Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) agency imposed a fine of 438M RUB (~$6.7M) on the U.S. search giant and ordered it to comply with the original FAS ruling to amend its agreements with OEMs to stop requiring they bundle its services and restricting others apps/services they can choose.",2016-10-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/android-apps.jpg?w=738,"european-competition-commission,smartphones",Google gets more time to respond to EU antitrust charges

At the same time, the company also launched a new publication, Cloud for Global Good, with no fewer than 78 public policy recommendations in 15 categories like data protection and accessibility issues.
The new expansion, investment and “trust” initiative were revealed by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who was speaking at an event in Dublin, Ireland. He said that the expansion would mean that Microsoft covers “more regions than any other cloud provider… In the last year the capacity has more than doubled.”
As a measure of how Microsoft and Amazon are intent on levelling each other on service availability right now, the news of the French data center comes one month after Amazon announced that it would also be building a data center in France.
Nadella, of course, did not mention AWS by name but that is the big elephant in the room for Microsoft. Nadella said today that Microsoft has data centers covering 30 regions across the globe, “more regions than any other cloud provider,” with the European footprint including Ireland, the Netherlands, the UK and Germany.
In Germany, its data center is operated by Deutsche Telekom on Microsoft’s behalf in a trustee model, a move made both for “digital sovereignty and compliance,” Nadella said, “and a real world understanding of what the customer needs.”
The popularity of cloud-based storage and services has grown exponentially in the last several years, fuelled by the rise of smartphones and tablets that rely on cloud-based architectures to run apps; as well as a rise of other consumer and enterprise services that have also taken a remote storage and processing approach to deliver software more efficiently.
While Microsoft may have lost to companies like Google/Android and Apple when it came to building a mobile platform or phone that is widely used by the mass market, it’s hoping that its presence in cloud services will give it a place at the table for computing in the future.
“We have a very particular point of view by what we mean by mobile first and cloud first,” Nadella said today “It’s about the mobility of your experience across all devices in your life [and] the way to achieve that mobility … those experiences… is only possible because of the cloud.”
As a business, it provides a very constant amount of recurring revenue for companies like Amazon and Microsoft, and as such is a strong engine for their respective financial performance. Offering basic services in the cloud like instances for developers also lays the ground work for upselling customers with a number of other features, ranging from other software and products through to more technology to improve apps, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence technology. (Nadella described his vision, for example, of “bots in every app”.)
The business aspects of the cloud were less the focus of today’s presentation. More to the point was a new, interesting position that Microsoft is laying out for itself as the “more trusted, more responsible and more inclusive” cloud provider, in the words of Nadella, presumably in contrast to others like Amazon and Google.
Microsoft has an interesting backstory when it comes to making news in Ireland. The country — in part due to its tax structure — has become the home for a number of major tech companies — not just Microsoft, but Facebook, Google, Apple and many more — when setting up their international headquarters, covering global operations outside of the U.S., which means that regulatory questions that arise in Ireland over issues like data protection or paying taxes have larger reverberations beyond it.
In the case of Microsoft, the company was long embroiled in a case it was fighting against the U.S. government over data that it stored in servers in Ireland, that the U.S. government wanted to access. (It won the case earlier this year.)
“Little did we know that this data center would lead to litigation against our own government… little did we know that if we persisted we would actually win the case,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s chief legal counsel and its president, in the presentation today. “People have rights and those rights need to be protected. We need to build a cloud that is responsible as well.”

219,Natasha Lomas,"The messaging wars are really a battle for attention. It’s all about which comms app giant can embed the stickiest and most addictive features into their platform to keep users inside their own well-tended garden, rather than peering over the wall at rivals’ plots.
In Facebook’s case today, that means launching a pared down version of its Messenger app to try to extend the edges of its messaging empire to markets where users may not have great Internet and/or a high end smartphone.
But, also today, messaging app Telegram is going the other way: announcing it’s powering up on the chatbot front with the launch of what it dubs a “bot-powered gaming platform” in a bid to try to drive more engagement via addictive new features.
The v3.13 update is now live for Android Telegram users to download, and will also land in the App Store for iOS users today.
Integrated HTML 5 games inside chats
While devs building for Telegram’s open platform could already make text-based bot games for the app — see, for example, PokerBot or WerewolfBot — the new API seeks to step up the stickiness by enabling more visually appealing games to live inside chats on the platform.
“You can now use bots to play games in your chats, complete with graphics and sound,” Telegram writes in a blog post announcing the new feature.
Examples it showcases in the post include a math based challenge game, called MathBattle, that it says its own developers built in three hours, and a football game called Football Star, built by a third party.
Other examples shown in the post include time-challenge games — such as Corsair, where you have to see how long you can avoid being shot, or, in the case of Lumberjack, avoid being crushed by falling tree branches.

So basically this is super simple mobile games embedded into the chat window and made inherently competitive thanks to an automatic running tally of your contacts’ scores that Telegram’s API enables.
“The best part of the Telegram Gaming Platform is the competition across all your existing chats. We save high scores for every game played in every chat, and you can instantly check out how you and your friends are doing against each other. Every time there’s a new leader in the game, other playing members of the chat are notified that they need to step it up,” it notes.
There’s about 30 games at launch, with the vast majority made by third party games developer Gamee. Albeit Telegram is obviously hoping for lots more to flood in — suggesting today that “hundreds” are in the pipeline.
“While these demos look basic, Telegram games can be anything from simple arcades and puzzles to multiplayer 3D-shooters and real-time strategy games,” it adds.
Betting big on bots
Telegram was a relatively early mover in the chatbot space, launching a bot platform back in June 2015 — months before the likes of Facebook and Line got in on the action, although lagging China’s WeChat platform (which has had automated accounts since 2013).
The question of how popular bots end up being with users of messaging apps in the Western world remains to be definitively answered at this nascent stage. Really that depends on whether bot makers can prove their creations have staying power and offer more than a bit of gimmicky novelty. And so far, despite all the hype, bots have been fairly underwhelming.
Telegram hasn’t quantified user engagement with bots via any solid metrics as yet. And it’s fair to say that Facebook Messenger’s early clutch of chatbots roundly failed to impress — it’s since tried to hone the user experience to dial down user confusion, so a fairly inauspicious start there.
Add to that Telegram, and most recently Line, has been actively trying to encourage developers to build “useful bots”, offering cash prizes as a lure. So it seems safe to file much of this chatbot activity under ‘work in progress’ at this stage.
That said, combining bots with gaming seems a smart move — with the potential to convert group chats into competitive, multiplayer gaming sessions with minimal effort (with the caveat that it might also get really annoying, a la FarmVille Facebook spam, from back in the day) — and thereby ramp up messaging engagement as friends battle it out to see who has the fastest mental arithmetic or dodging skills or history knowledge or whatnot.
Telegram is pitching developers to port existing HTML5 games to its platform to quickly build out the number of games its hosting — touting the process as quick and easy.
“The new API is pretty straightforward, so any developer of an existing HTML5-based game can integrate it with the Telegram social graph and competitive leaderboard in a matter of a few hours,” co-founder Pavel Durov tells TechCrunch.
On the user side, to access gaming bots within a chat a user needs to @ the relevant bot to get instructions on how to start playing. For example, to launch the MathBattle bot a Telegram user types @gamebot into any chat and then selects ‘MathBattle’.
The platform automatically keeps tabs on scoring, maintaining a competitive leaderboard across all their contacts and gaming titles in play. And this is where Durov reckons things will get really sticky.
“I think the competitive factor is a game changer here,” he says. “Since every group chat can now be instantly turned into a competition in anything. It can even become a competition in History or Math.”
Let’s just hope things don’t get really spammy. Choose your games (and your Telegram contacts) wisely.
Gamee’s CEO and co-founder Bozena Rezab side-steps a question about how long it took the company to reincarnate 23 of its existing HTML5 titles as Telegram bots, noting only that it already had a lot of experience with social gaming. But she was happy to talk up the potential of melding bots and games — dubbing it a “new era in casual gaming”.
“It is very exciting to play games in the environment, where communication with friends happens,” she said via email. “Telegram has the most advanced inline bot API, which makes it possible to play and compete with groups of friends directly in the chat, no barriers.”
How is Gamee intending to monetize its Telegram gaming bots? The short answer is it’s not — at least not right now. “We do not focus on monetization here at this point,” she said.
So that’s another question mark over the longevity of bots — at least until a mechanism arrives for monetizing them. However Durov has previously said a payments mechanism is coming for Telegram bots this year, and he confirms to TechCrunch that the team is still on track for a 2016 launch. So devs will be hoping they won’t have too long to wait.
Telegram also claims its new gaming platform doesn’t bloat the platform — requiring in its words “0 bytes of disk space”. “The underlying technology is HTML5, so games are loaded on-demand as needed, just like ordinary webpages,” it adds.
Support wise, the new chatbot-powered games will work on iPhones 4 and newer and on Android 4.4 devices and newer. Users will need Telegram v3.13 to be able to play.

220,Mike Butcher,"“We shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing, by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium. Synthetic food will, of course, also be used in the future. Nor need the pleasures of the table be banished. That gloomy Utopia of tabloid meals need never be invaded. The new foods will be practically indistinguishable from the natural products from the outset, and any changes will be so gradual as to escape observation.”
That prediction was made by Winston Churchill in the March 1932 issue of Popular Mechanics in an essay entitled “Fifty Years Hence.” Yes, the yet-to-be wartime prime minister of England predicted lab-grown meat, nuclear power, cell phones, genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. In 1932.
But Seth Bannon, who had to deal with major mistakes made early in his career, said that what struck him most when he read it was how much this far-sighted thinking chimed with the mission of the “Impact VC” he planned to create with his partner and co-founder Ela Madej. The two (who are also a couple) wanted to nurture businesses that would have an impact 50 years hence. So it seemed a good idea to borrow Churchill’s essay title for their company name.
Fifty Years (Facebook, Twitter) wants to tackle a few issues that seem to plague the relationship between entrepreneur, investor and the demands of capitalism.
While working as entrepreneurs themselves, the two had found it hard to find savvy investors that could both help them scale their businesses, but would also back the actual mission of the company. They tended to do the first but not the second.
They also found that “maximizing shareholder value” did not speak to their values in business, nor to their fellow millennials, who are often at least as interested in creating a real, profit-led business that can also have a positive societal or environmental impact.
So they decided to create Fifty Years to support entrepreneurs solving the world’s biggest problems with technology. But they didn’t want to turn into something like a charity or traditional ‘impact’ investor. They still wanted to back companies that could be both massively profitable and make a serious dent in solving big problems like climate change, education and health.
Fifty Years will invest at the seed stage, based on a built product, and ideally some market validation. Right now, Fifty Years is into synthetic biology and food tech, but it doesn’t limit its investments to any specific verticals. It just needs to be presented with big business potentials and the opportunity to solve a big problem in the world.
The pair make for an interesting combination.

Madej, who was a serial tech entrepreneur and a Y Combinator alum (YC S12), is also a vegan, skier and contemporary dancer.
Outside of a short break as a dancer in NYC in the summer of 2013, Madej has been in tech since 2006. She co-founded and was a CEO of the Ruby on Rails software house Applicake (acquired in 2013) in Krakow in her native Poland and co-founded Base CRM. She had also been very active in the Polish & European tech scenes, becoming a partner at Innovation Nest, a leading early stage venture fund in Eastern Europe, until moving permanently to the US in 2014. She became interested in “impact investing” after realising that many of today’s tech unicorns were being built largely for a privileged, developed society rather than the world as a whole.
Bannon, an avid chess player, was the founder and CEO of Amicus, a startup that builds digital organising tools for nonprofits and political campaigns. A graduate of Y Combinator, Bannon was named twice to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for social entrepreneurship. He was inspired to think this way because of his Mom, a social and community activist, who became disabled after a freak gas explosion in the family home. He later worked for Obama and built a digital organising tool.
But it hasn’t all been an upward curve. Lack of experience at the time meant Bannon made serious mistakes at Amicus which almost killed the company, mistakes he later published in detail before anyone else. These included the big mistake of not paying payroll taxes for several years after a simple filing error stopped the company being alerted to the problem.
“The main way it effects Fifty Years is in our ability to help our founders,” says Bannon. “Our combined experience makes us better investors. Ela has made a bunch of good decisions, and I’ve made a bunch of mistakes. Our founders learn from both.”
That difficult period means he’s perhaps more attuned to the harsh realities founders face. “When Fifty Years thinks about the future we think about the why not the what.” In other words, he says, not the method of delivery (like, say, drones) but why the startup exists in the first place, it’s mission.
Bannon thinks society is moving towards a position of wanting to make money and solve real problems. And he doesn’t mean ‘changing the world’ by “decreasing enterprise churn, or matching socks to trousers. We mean fixing the climate crisis, educating people etc. We think these businesses will be the most valuable over the next decade. And those that don’t solve these problems won’t be able to compete.”
He admits this motivation is largely driven by a general millennial thinking (though not exclusively), but that this attitude really came to the fore this year. “We want Fifty years to be a source of capital for these people,” he says. His view is backed up by research. By 2025, 75% of the global workforce will be millennials, the generation born between 1982 and 2000. Millennials, while also tagged ‘selfie-obsessed’, ‘entitled’ and ‘self-indulgent’, are significantly more engaged with sustainability and social justice than previous generations. They’re generally highly educated, they’ve had strong awareness of social and environmental issues from an early age and are keenly aware of the challenges faced by climate change.
Admittedly the short-termism inherent in most businesses works, in theory, against the Fifty Years model. But Bannon is relaxed about that: “It’s a problem for the entire industry, but it doesn’t affect us more than anyone else. We’re just funding companies that tie in their profits to their impact very closely.”
“Impact investors have been around for a long time. They will fund a cash flow business in Kenya for instance. But we’re funding very typically high growth Silicon Valley companies that are solving a big issue.”
He says the language of Silicon Valley has tended to debase what it really means to “change the world”. “We often joke about the doorknob startup that ‘connects people to their homes’. It’s the language of Silicon Valley we bump up against.”
Madej says: “The big contribution we can make is to get more money committed to vehicles that create the next Teslas. Over time the idea is to change the narrative of business to address social and environmental externalities. Like feeding people bad food and then realising you have to have expensive healthcare to offset the side effects.”
Okay, but how are they going to measure all this? How are they going to realise the value in the social impact?
“Right now we don’t have enough computing power to model where the dollar value is in true value terms, but we will have it eventually,” says Madej.
“We use as a rough rubric the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We look at a company that could have massive returns and have an impact on some of these goals. We fully expect to have amazing returns from this fund, then be able to create further funds,” she says.
“We have been involved in tech startups as entrepreneurs and we feel comfortable advising other entrepreneurs. We already know we could raise a bigger fund later on. But we want to get the basics right first,” she adds.
And it turns out investors/LPs in the fund are interested, especially as it’s being run as if it were a traditional VC fund with traditional returns.
Bannon says they started quickly and raised enough to make some investments, then raised the rest: “After that it was much easier.”
Their investing philosophy is that they don’t care about the sector the startup is in. But the founder needs to be care about capital returns, making a dent in the SDGs and, finally, care about doing both at the same time.
Madej: “All our companies have the potential to solve problems globally but their initial markets will be in the US, because it’s so much easier to start and scale from here.”
Eleven of the 15 they’ve invested in so far have been in the ‘YC universe’, showing that, although they don’t get special access, Madej and Bannon are sufficiently close enough to that ecosystem to be able to meet companies they might typically invest in.
Will they be copied in their approach? Do competitors loom on the horizon? They admit to feeling a little lonely out there but that the Obvious Corp founded by Evan Williams is closest to their thinking right now.
“We want there to be an ecosystem of other funds like us. We’ll need others to fill out rounds, of course” says Madej.
“We think this is an urgent problem. A lot of non-profits are badly positioned to solve big scalable, global problems, while tech companies are. But there needs to be a lot more people in this space,” says Bannon.
Next year the pair plan to double the portfolio size and also work on their related meetup Impact.Tech, which has mushroomed into a 500 person event in San Francisco, with the potential for multiple locations.
This runs monthly events with the goal of exploring all the areas of business activity in which tech entrepreneurship can solve big social and environmental problems.
“We eventually want to get to the Al Gores, and maybe even the Obamas, of this world and get them on board” says Bannon.
And with this kind of thinking, they probably will.

221,Natasha Lomas,"Security firm Avast has today confirmed the completion of a $1.4 billion acquisition of fellow Czech-based antivirus company AVG. The deal will see Avast’s customer base nearly double — swelling from 230 million to more than 400 million in total, 160M of whom are mobile users.
The acquisition was announced back in July, with scale and geographical breadth touted as the driving forces, along with a plan to expand product offerings including in the Internet of Things space.
Avast says the new combined entity reaches one-third of the world’s PC users outside of China. Both the Avast and AVG brands are likely to continue to operate, depending on relative market strengths.
There will be job cuts, based on eliminating duplicate roles, but Avast is not confirming how many or where they will come at this stage.
The purchase price values AVG at $25 per share, for a total price-tag of $1.3BN, but Avast CEO Vince Steckler said there was also around $100M of AVG debt to pay off — bumping the total paid to $1.4BN.
The acquisition has been completed within the originally slated timeframe.
Speaking to TechCrunch ahead of the deal closing, Steckler said the two companies have been circling each other for decades, given their shared industry and business location. And finally the summer Avast convinced AVG they were better off as one.
“This was, I think, the fourth attempt we have made in the last two or two and a half years to buy AVG,” he said. “We approached them, we got kind of tired of being constantly turned down — so we approached them kind of one last time and told them hey we’ll pay this amount, no higher, no negotiations, tell us yes or no. And they said yes.
“That came together very, very quick — within a matter of days, really.”
But while competitive spirit kept them apart for years — a combination of “pride and arrogance” on both sides, reckons Steckler — larger forces reshaping the computing landscape and the security market are evidently driving them together now. “There’s a better long term future for a combined entity, than two smaller, standalone entities.”
One very big motivator Steckler mentions for the acquisition is machine learning technology now being used to power many security solutions. And AI’s need for data, lots and lots of data.
“Security these days — for the top companies — is very much a big data thing. We’re not into the classic signatures and checksums. These are big data machine learning products, and they rely on having a massive number of end-points to collect data from, to process, to determine what’s good and what isn’t,” he said.
“Getting hold of AVG’s 160M end points, to add to our 240M, it adds a lot more end points into our data analysis — which improves the security results and allows us to stay ahead of others.”
“All the top flight ‘antivirus products’ are all extraordinarily sophisticated, and many of them — such as ours — exist mostly in the cloud. And they run mostly on machine learning and AI,” he added.
The other trend squeezing veteran security players and driving consolidation is of course the decline of traditional AV revenues, especially on the consumer side where free/freemium antivirus products now dominate. The old paid antivirus cash-cow is not what it once was, with PC shipment slowdowns and the shift to mobile computing another factor driving change there.
“The security industry is obviously really maturing, and — at least on the consumer side — the market has heavily shifted to free and freemium,” noted Steckler. “So there’s a pretty rapidly declining marketshare for companies like Norton and McAfee and Kaspersky.”
But he asserted that Avast and AVG have complementary footprints — with AVG doing well in the English-speaking world and Avast in the non-English speaking world — making the pair a good fit to ride out tougher times together.
“The fact that we have such a large geographic spread allows us to ride much better through the market ups and downs,” he said. “For example, the English language markets are hurt a lot more by the slowdown in PC shipments than the non-English markets. But the English markets monetize much better than the non-English markets, so we have kind of complementary strengths and weaknesses.”
Discussing the shift to mobile computing, Steckler said there are a different set of concerns Avast can (and is) addressing here, via mobile products that focus more on privacy and parental concerns than on traditional malware security threats.
“People use their mobile devices for a lot of different things. You’ve got photos on there, some are sensitive, some are embarrassing, you’ve got children who are using phones while they are driving — you’ve got corporations where phones are being used by employees, sometimes for company use. Sometimes for personal use. So the mobile security market is actually pretty big,” he said.
“It’s not the classic AV but there’s lots of other types of security and privacy products. And this is absolutely one of the reasons why we wanted to buy AVG — because AVG have a really good security product that’s not installed on the phones but is installed at the carrier.”
Running security products directly on phones themselves is pretty limiting, he said — given they are just another siloed app and can be disabled by the user. Which makes working with carriers Avast’s preferred route.
“If you install on the carrier infrastructure you’ve got a lot of things now. For example you can implement a family safety product or geofences so that if your child is driving they can’t text message, or if they’re at school they can’t be using the phone. Or you can control how much data they’re using or what they’re really doing on the mobile device,” he added.
“That’s been a very successful business in the US. It’s in the four US carriers and what we want to do is to move that out of the US and frankly that’s going to be the core of a lot of our mobile business.”
Discussing the company’s strategy for the Internet of Things, he noted Avast already has a security product here, focusing on securing IoT devices via the router. Meanwhile AVG was exploring a different strategy — meaning, again, Steckler sees benefits to combining their different efforts.
But at the end of the day he couches IoT as a fairly simply security nut to crack — given most devices connect to the Internet via a router or network gateway.
“I suspect that most of the security for IoT is going to end up at the cloud or at the network level and not really in the device itself,” he said. “If you think about it, why does your Fitbit need to run security software? It doesn’t talk to the Internet, it talks to the router, so you get the router to protect the Fitbit.”
“Very few of the [IoT] things actually directly connect to the Internet. Most everything connects to the router, which connects to the Internet. So… you don’t need to necessarily protect each device because most of the devices are fairly simplistic. What you need to do is protect the devices from being broken into and the easiest point of doing that is at the network or gateway level. Which is where we do it.”",2016-09-30,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/vince-and-threat-labs.jpg?w=738,"avg-technologies,avast-software,software,freeware",Avast CEO on why it’s just spent $1.4BN to absorb security rival AVG
222,Natasha Lomas,"A dramatic privacy about-face by messaging app WhatsApp this summer, in which it revealed an update to its T&Cs would for the first time allow the sharing of its user data with parent company Facebook, is getting the pair into hot water in Europe.
This week Facebook was ordered to stop harvesting data on WhatsApp users in Germany by the Hamburg city DPA, which hit out at the controversial change to WhatsApp’s T&Cs as both misleading to users and a breach of national data protection law. (Facebook disagrees, and is appealing the order in Germany.)
It now looks the UK’s national data protection watchdog, the ICO, is preparing to ramp up its action too. The ICO had already been — in its words — “considering” the deal, questioning whether the two companies were being transparent with users about how their data is being shared and used.
But speaking to the BBC’s PM program on Radio 4 yesterday, information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said it has launched “an investigation into the data-sharing”.
Asked by the BBC whether the ICO intends to follow the Hamburg DPA’s lead and order the data-sharing to be stopped, Denham said: “My intervention is an advocacy intervention on behalf of all of the WhatsApp users in the UK — and boy have we heard from them! They are quite concerned.
“There’s a lot of anger out there. And again it goes back to promises, commitment, fairness and transparency. We have launched an investigation into the data-sharing, remembering that in 2014 when Facebook bought WhatsApp there was a commitment made that between the two companies they would not share information.”
The new WhatsApp T&Cs state that user data — including the mobile number used to register to use the service and a user’s last seen time within the app — will be shared with Facebook and the “Facebook family of companies”, including for marketing and ad targeting purposes.
Users reading the T&Cs before clicking ‘I agree’ might notice that there is a way to opt out of the data-sharing for ad targeting — but the agreement default opts users in, and the text next to the toggle to refuse to share is arguably confusingly worded. So it’s likely that many WhatsApp users will have agreed to the new privacy policy without realizing that means they are now handing data to Facebook.
“It’s an active and important investigation,” Denham added, during the PM interview. “I know the public wants to hear from us as to what we’re doing — and you will hear from us very shortly.”
A spokeswoman for the ICO could not confirm whether or not the ICO has a formal investigation into the data-sharing underway at this point, but did say it would be putting out an update soon, perhaps later today or on Monday.
In the PM interview, Denham was also pressed on whether the ICO is doing anything to stop data flowing now, while it probes the arrangement, but she said she thinks no data is yet flowing from UK WhatsApp users to Facebook.
“We are told that data is not yet being shared — so I am hoping that there is a pause in the data-sharing, and some rethinking of the terms and the consent and what data is being shared,” she said.
We’ve asked Facebook to confirm whether or not it is harvesting UK WhatsApp data at this point or not and will update this post with any response.
Making a general statement about the data-sharing agreement earlier this month, Europe’s Article 29 Working Party, the data protection body that represents the collective views of the DPAs of all 28 Member State of the EU, asserted that: “Users should keep control of their data when Internet giants massively compile it.”
Denham also referenced the WhatsApp-Facebook privacy controversy in other public comments this week, making her first public speech since taking over the role from the prior ICO, Christopher Graham.
Speaking at an event in London she noted: “We are currently reviewing data sharing between WhatsApp and other Facebook companies — all of this is about transparency and individual control.”
(Ironically that event, a one day conference entitled Personal Information Economy 2016, organized by a business consultancy called Ctrl–Shift, was funded with the help of Facebook cash — the event organizers confirmed to TechCrunch Facebook was one of the sponsors. So no surprise another of the speakers was Facebook’s Stephen Deadman, aka its global deputy “Chief Privacy Officer”. Ctrl Shift said all sponsors for the event were “printed clearly” in the event brochure that was shared with delegates on the day.)
In a wide-ranging first public speech that set our her priorities for leading the UK regulator through turbulent post-Brexit times, Denham said the ICO intends to pick and choose its investigations with the aim of maximizing its impact — to, as she put it, “enable results which can cascade across a sector”.
She added that technology is “already at the forefront of most of our major investigations”, noting that the ICO has also been asking questions about the massive Yahoo data breach, finally confirmed last week.
“As an independent regulator we have powers to issue fines of up to half a million pounds which could eventually rise to four percent of a business’ global turnover,” she warned. “In an ideal world we wouldn’t need to enforce, but we will use the stick in the cupboard when necessary. And remember it’s not just about the money — it’s about your reputation too, with your customers, the public and in the media spotlight.”
EC’s competition commissioner also eyeing big data and privacy
The Facebook-WhatsApp data-sharing agreement has also caught the attention of the EC’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, who earlier this month revealed her department was asking questions about the privacy policy changes, noting that the fact they didn’t merge data was factored in when the acquisition was approved.
Speaking at a conference on big data in Brussels this week, Vestager argued for the need for EU-wide regulation on data — referencing the Facebook-WhatsApp controversy and suggesting new rules are needed to enable the region’s regulators to keep up with tech giants’ use (and potential misuse) of data.
“Europe’s competition enforcers need to work together on big data — not just the Commission, but the national competition authorities as well,” she said. “Many of them are already doing that. Our French colleagues have launched a sector inquiry on big data. And the German authority is looking at whether Facebook may have misused its power to impose unfair privacy terms.
“But if we want to be able to deal with big data issues throughout the EU, then every national authority has to have the tools it needs to enforce the rules… I think there’s a strong case for new EU rules as part of the answer.”
Big data as a currency that can be used by tech giants to stifle competition is a theme Vestager has spoken on several times before.

223,Romain Dillet,"French startup Lydia raised $7.8 million (€7 million) from New Alpha AM and Oddo & Cie in order to expand to other European countries. The startup lets you easily pay back your friends without any fee using a mobile app — among other things. Think about it as a sort of Venmo for France.
While Lydia has only been available in France, with today’s funding round, the company plans to launch in other European markets. With 500,000 users in France, it’s time to look at other countries.
Lydia plans to launch in the U.K., Germany and Spain during the first half of 2017. Lydia also has some ambitious goals, including reaching 3 million users in two years.
Other startups in other European countries also provide peer-to-peer payment services — for instance, Revolut in the U.K. and Cookies in Germany. So Lydia will have to expand quickly before these local competitors become too ubiquitous.
But Lydia doesn’t plan to stop at geographical expansions. Just a few weeks ago, the company introduced a good old plastic card to pay in millions of retail stores. It’s a regular MasterCard, but you can customize it to your needs in the Lydia app.
Transactions appear instantly, you can block and unblock online payments, foreign payments, ATM withdrawals and more. Similarly, you can set different payment limits and all changes are reflected instantly.

224,Natasha Lomas,"Facebook has been ordered to stop harvesting the data of WhatsApp users in Germany.
The move follows the latter’s shock announcement last month that it would start sharing user data with its parent company, Facebook, including users’ phone numbers and last seen time in the app. Stated uses for the data includes marketing/ad targeting.
Shock because, back at the time of the $19BN acquisition, WhatsApp’s founder publicly stated that nothing would change for users of the ad-free messaging platform as a result of selling to the social network giant. Full marks if you didn’t believe a word of it at the time.
But reneging on such public statement looks to be what’s got the two into hot water in Hamburg now, with the city’s data protection authority describing the resulting situation as both misleading for users and a breach of national data protection law.
The Hamburg DPA is able to issue a national order against Facebook’s business in Germany because the company has a branch office located in the city.
In a statement today, data protection commissioner Johannes Caspar ordered Facebook to delete any data it has already harvested from Germany’s 35 million WhatsApp users, and to stop collecting more — asserting that Facebook has not obtained permission from WhatsApp users for connecting their accounts.
He also accused Facebook of harvesting millions of phone numbers, via WhatsApp users’ contact lists, of people who might be neither a Facebook nor a WhatsApp user.
Last month WhatsApp users were pushed a notification of updated terms and conditions for the app, and agreeing to them default opted users in to sharing data with Facebook. Although a more careful reader of the T&Cs might have noticed there was a toggle at the end which could be switched to opt out of sharing data with Facebook for marketing/ad targeting purposes.
“The arrangement protects the data of about 35 million WhatsApp users in Germany. It has to be their respective decision whether they want to connect their account with Facebook. This requires Facebook to ask permission beforehand. This has not happened,” he said (translated from German via Google Translate).
“In addition there are many millions of people whose contact details were uploaded from the address books of users WhatsApp, without requiring them to have something to do with Facebook or WhatsApp.
“This enormous amount of data, Facebook has not yet been collected by his own admission. The response from Facebook that this is simply not yet taken place at the time, however, gives cause for concern that the extent of the data breach even more massive impact will lead to. ”
Facebook has said it intends to appeal the order.
In a statement provided to TechCrunch in response to the action, a spokesperson for the company said: “Facebook complies with EU data protection law. We will appeal this order and will work with the Hamburg DPA in an effort to address their questions and resolve any concerns.”
This is not the only headache for the WhatsApp-Facebook data-sharing deal in Europe, which has a different data protection regime than the U.S. — a factor that has derailed other Facebook moves (such as leading it to turn off a facial recognition-powered tagging feature in the region back in 2012).
The shift to Facebook cross-referencing WhatsApp user data and app analytics with other services it owns and operates has also caught the attention of the UK’s ICO data protection watchdog — which last month said it was looking into whether the two companies were being transparent with users about how their data is being shared and used.
In a general statement earlier this month the Article 29 Working Party, the European body that represents the collective views of the DPAs of the 28 Member State of the EU, said: “Users should keep control of their data when Internet giants massively compile it.”
It added that it and each national DPA “closely monitor any privacy policy changes”.",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/fb-whatsapp1.png?w=738,"data-protection,privacy",Facebook ordered to stop harvesting data on WhatsApp users in Germany
225,Ingrid Lunden,"Are you a Spotify user who has a list of favorite bands and songs, but do not have the motivation to find and organize all of them into useful playlists? Today, the streaming company is launching a new service called Daily Mix that is partly aimed at you. Tapping into your own history of albums and tracks that you have listened to on the platform, Daily Mix brings together a selection of these alongside a few new things to create long, “bottomless” playlists of music to keep you listening. As its name implies, the playlists change every day, and range in number between one and six, depending on how prolific you are on Spotify.
Daily Mix is rolling out globally across all of Spotify’s footprint today to all users, first on Spotify’s Android and iOS apps, where it will sit prominently at the top of your Library menu. Matthew Ogle, the product manager overseeing it, says that Spotify is working on porting it to other platforms like web and desktop, too.
Spotify has built in a lot of playlist facility over the years to drive more listening on its platform. That includes the playlists you’ve created yourself; playlists created by other users; Discover Weekly curated by Spotify’s team; and Spotify Radio, which technically is not a playlist but is one more way of listening to music on the platform based around a theme without having to proactively pick everything out yourself each time.
(In fact, the team that built Radio built Daily Mix. “Internally we were referring it to as personal radio,” Ogle told me.) 
Many of these are more about discovery and recommendation, while Daily Mix plays more on what is already familiar to you.
Playlists generally are big business for the company. Spotify does not share many stats about how much they are used, but Ogle points out that Discover Weekly has been used at some point by more than 40 million of Spotify’s 100 million users.
And as Spotify continues to grow and bring in more casual music fans, playlists become an increasingly essential part of the mix to keep the service from being too labor intensive to use (the classic problem: I can listen to anything, but can’t decide or think of what I want.)
“When we started we were just a search box and millions of tracks, and today the most engaged users are the people who maintain and built and keep their playlists up to date,” Ogle told me. “But as we grow we attract music lovers who don’t want to put that effort in and do that day to day, so we hope that this will bring that kind of engagement to them.”
Although the Daily Mix is in part there to make casual or newer Spotify users feel a little more at home, there are a few quirks with the service that run counter to that. For starters if you have listened to nothing at all on the platform, for now you cannot get a Daily Mix (since it is based on your listening history).
For now, if you are a new user you will see a message saying something along the lines of: “Play your favorites and come back soon to find your Daily Mix.” Ogle tells me they are currently “looking of ways to get people into the experience more quickly.” For now it could take about two weeks for your first Daily Mix to come through — which may be one reason they’re putting it so high up in your library.
The algorithms that run this date back to Spotify’s acquisition of The Echo Nest in 2014. The startup’s music tech, which helps with recommendations of “lookalike” music, is regularly used in a lot of internal experiments around what Spotify might roll out next, and has also made its way to a number of products, such as Fresh Finds.
Ogle tells me that right now the proportion of your own favorite tracks to those you might not know is 75%/25% — a balance that they might change over time, depending on how people are responding. With the new feature, Spotify is also introducing something else: new buttons that will help inform Spotify of what you do and don’t like: a heart to add it to your own collection, and a “ban” to banish it.
Ogle said that his team are looking of places to add these into other parts of the Spotify app.
Engagement is a crucial metric for Spotify: the company earlier this month revealed that it now has 40 million paying users, which appears to indicate that it currently growing faster than Apple Music (respectively they gained 10 million and 4 million over a five-month period).
We’ve heard from sources that Spotify — which has raised over $1.5 billion in funding to date — is aiming for an IPO filing by the end of this year, with a listing in 2017. (Caveat: we’ve been hearing talk of a Spotify IPO for years now.) In any case, strong engagement metrics, showing consumers who are not only dipping into the service but using it every day, point to a dedicated audience that will be less likely to disappear over time, and if they are ‘free’ users, might tip into paying users in the process.",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/spotify-globe.jpg?w=738,"streaming-music,music","With Daily Mix, Spotify taps algorithms to make infinite playlists from your favorite tunes"
226,Jon Russell,"Samsung has made a significant move among its leadership ranks after Jay Y. Lee, son of company chairman Kun-Hee Lee and its expected future leader, was nominated to the company’s board.
Jay Y. Lee has long been tipped as heir apparent to Lee Kun-Hee, who grew the company into the giant it is today but has been hospitalized for two years since suffering a heart attack. 46-year-old Jay Y. Lee has steadily gained new titles and increased his areas of responsibility in recent years, but his nomination to the Samsung board is the most significant sign of his eventual accession.
Samsung said in a statement that “the time is now right” for the nomination, which will allow the younger Lee “to take a more active role in… strategic decision-making.”
Lee Kun-Hee himself took over from his father, Lee Byung-chull who founded the Samsung group, back in 1987. He grew the business to the point that it accounts for 20 percent of Korea’s GDP, while his own personal wealth makes him one of the planet’s richest 100 people, but his tenure has been tainted by corruption. He resigned in 2008 following an investigation into the use of company funds for bribes, however he was pardoned in 2009 and returned to his role a year later.
Jay Y. Lee is expected to take the reins once his father dies. He is noted by watchers for helping develop relationships with companies like Sony and HP, while he led negotiations with Apple, which included the legal dispute that ended in a 2012 ruling in a favor of Apple. Samsung was ordered to pay its U.S. rival more than $1 billion after being found guilty of infringing on its patents.
Samsung has had a tumultuous couple of years since that ruling, with its financial results showing signs of a slow down as increased competition in the mobile market and the effects of global economics weighed on its business.
Things have been brighter this year, however. Samsung recently posted its best financials for two years, and released two highly acclaimed new flagship smartphones this year: the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy Note 7. In the case of the latter, though, Samsung was forced to issue a recall after a number of devices exploded.
“In the competitive and rapidly changing technology industry, Mr. Lee has extensive experience as a business leader over many years and has made important contributions to the success of Samsung Electronics. The company has seen improvements in the performance of its key business areas in recent years,” Samsung said in a statement.",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/shutterstock_237645046.jpg?w=738,jay-y-lee,Samsung’s heir apparent to take a company board seat
227,Jon Russell,"Southeast Asia-based shopping site iPrice has introduced a major update that brings direct price comparison to its e-commerce aggregation service.
iPrice raised $1.2 million last year and it aims to be a one-stop destination for online shopping in Southeast Asia, a region noted for its potential as internet access continues to grow among its 600 million cumulative population. It claims more than 500 merchant partners and 1.6 million visitors monthly, and has added a new price comparison feature in order to make it easier for visitors to find the right deals.
The feature works in two ways. If you look at a product, iPrice will pull up a list of related variants to help you to easily find the exact one of your choice. So, if that’s a smartphone, then you’ll see related based on specifics like color, storage space, and model, for example.
Secondly, and perhaps importantly, it pulls in additional information like delivery time, delivery cost and payment options into a single view. That’s important because e-commerce remains nascent in Southeast Asia with many shipments taking days perhaps because they are cross-border, while payment type is essential because credit card penetration is below 10 percent across the region. Putting that all in a single place before you click out to go to the retailer’s website is far more convenient.

Initially, the price comparison feature is active on tech items, like smartphones. Other products, which include clothes, shoes, bags and jewelry, are displayed as outgoing links which, when clicked, take a visitor straight to the merchant website. Thereafter, if the customer makes a purchase, iPrice takes a cut for generating the business.
“There is a gap between what the competitors are providing and what is value for the consumer,” iPrice CEO David Chmelar told TechCrunch in an interview. “We want to put consumers at the front, and we did a lot of research about how people shop online.”
Chmelar said that iPrice, which is headquartered in Malaysia and offers coupons as well as deal aggregation, is looking at other ways that it can package data to make the shopping experience more intuitive.
“There are other possibilities around how you can work with the same data but provide additional value add by displaying it in a better way. We really want to master price comparison and there’s so much we can do,” he added.",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/iprice.jpg?w=738,"singapore,southeast-asia,ecommerce,iprice",iPrice adds price comparison to its one-stop e-commerce site in Southeast Asia
228,Jon Russell,"Technology is finally changing the real estate business in the West, but the issues around home purchase and rental are all the more acute in emerging markets. In many parts of the world, property information is limited and haphazardly organized, and a variety of actors — each with their own interests — are unavoidably and centrally involved.
Doorkeys is a new startup in India that wants to bring the process of buying a home online to make things more transparent and efficient.
Founded by real estate veteran Subhash Bedi, chairman of Rising Straits Capital, and entrepreneur Arjun Basu, who co-founded services marketplace Mydala.com, the company is backed by an initial $2 million in capital and it went live on September 1.
The platform is essentially a marketplace between buyers and sellers. Unlike competitors such as NoBroker, which disintermediate middlemen entirely, Doorkeys is pro broker. That’s to say that it wants to work with the existing system and its actors but move them into the digital era.
“The U.S. has never been able to disinter-mediate the broker, so how is a highly untransparent market like India going to?” Bedi told TechCrunch in an interview. “The concept seems very far fetched. We like to think of Doorkeys like an online CRM system for the broker.”
Doorkeys is a marketplace that enables buyers to look up potential properties based on location, price and other variables. Sellers, aka brokers, are all graded so when it comes to finding someone to arrange a viewing and, later, deal, buyers can look up the top-rated brokers and browser past comments based on their performance. The idea is to incentivize brokers to act in the best interests of buyers, something that many do not do right now in India.
“There are over 500,000 brokers in India. It is very fragmented, [but] we will provide them with tools and use their knowledge of neighbors and cities to build a framework around this unregulated area,” Basu added, explaining that a number of offline functions also require brokers.
The company doesn’t charge sellers and buyers, instead it monetizes through an undisclosed commission fee on deals. Already, it is aiming for an ambitious $70 million in annual take-home revenue within the next two years.
“We have already tapped into some of the largest broker networks and they understand the value add. They are not paying ridiculous money for leads or, in the case of traditional advertising, fake leads,” Basu said.

Bedi explained that he began talking to Basu about the idea after he scouted India for investment opportunities in the property tech segment but came away unimpressed.
Initially, Doorkeys covers New Delhi and we shouldn’t expect a rapid expansion for now, the founders clarified.
“Launching in New Delhi first is very important because it is a local game,” Basu explained. “[We need] to make the unit economics work on a local level first.”
Looking forward, he said that India’s top eight or so cities account for around 80 percent of the country’s real estate transaction volumes so the target will be a presence in those tier-one locations rather than across every corner of India.
In line with that focus on proving its model, the company wants to keep its costs “lean.” It currently has around 40 staff and plans to double that number before the end of the year.
“The founding team will continue to put money in [and] there are various large influencers in the real estate industry who will be putting more seed-type money in over the coming months,” Bedi said. “Eventually, we will look to add a “grade a” investor — having said that, the key thing is to keep the burn rate low, it is an asset light model and you need to wait for adoption.”",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/shutterstock_287797142.jpg?w=738,"india,property,real-estate",New startup Doorkeys aims to drag property buying in India into the digital era
229,Yoel Zanger,"

The rapid growth of streaming is taking the globe by storm, but no country seems to have the market potential for OTT video streaming quite like China. While the United States OTT market is beginning to show signs of saturation, it is not a surprise that more than 720 million Chinese internet users seem like the next big opportunity.
The reality, however, is less than perfect.
Prior to 2014, it was like the “Wild East” in China, with little regulation and rampant piracy. This radically changed following a SARFT regulation in 2014; since then, the OTT business in China consolidated and became highly regulated by the government. Indeed, only seven companies were granted the license to distribute streaming video.
The majority of broadcasted content is controlled by China Central Television (CCTV), which owns the internet-based China Network Television (CNTV) and its subsidiary Future TV. The additional OTT players include CIBN (established by China Radio International), Best TV (a subsidiary of Shanghai Media Group), Wasu Digital TV Media Group (Alibaba partners), Southern TV, CETV  and Twitch-like live streaming platform Panda TV.  With Tencent (the country’s biggest online gaming and social media company) distributing OTT content under a CCTV license, one can easily understand that gaining such permission is not an easy task for newcomers.
Additionally, U.S. content is very popular in China, but also heavily regulated. Tencent acquired rights to distribute NBA games, as well as some HBO and Time Warner titles. Other examples include online streaming company Sohu, which streams Netflix’s House of Cards, and web services company Baidu’s online video unit, iQIYI, which carries Fox’s theatrical releases. But online content providers have to put emphasis on homegrown content, as well, because, according to Chinese regulations, broadcasters and streaming services can’t dedicate more than 30 percent of their programming to foreign content. That is likely the reason Netflix is not rushing to go big in China.
Chinese viewers are accustomed to local alternatives of the most popular online global giants, including Baidu for Google, Alibaba’s Youku for YouTube, Renren for Facebook, Tencent WeChat for WhatsApp  and Weibo for Twitter, to name a few. For a long time, China has been mastering the art of creating substitutes of Western solutions in order to feed the digital needs of the internet-hungry population.
Government censorship dictates the rules that foreign companies unsurprisingly find difficult to abide. Unlike YouTube, almost half of the content on Youku includes full-length episodes, cartoons, movies and TV shows that have been uploaded by license-holding partners, such as film and TV production companies in China. On top of sourcing original and licensed content, Youku is investing in high-end user-generated content and programming created by semi-pros, targeting audiences that turn to online platforms for entertainment.
To enforce copyright infringement and censorship rules for inappropriate or offensive content, Chinese internet companies allow the government to scan their video libraries. This is something that YouTube, the online video king in most parts of the world, will not allow. And yet Youku and iQIYI, the most popular online video services in Mainland China, reach tens of millions of unique users on their apps for TVs, and hundreds of millions on mobile devices.
Live streaming is a huge deal in China. Its skyrocketing popularity can be attributed to the fact that the young mobile users are hungry for more edgy content compared to what is made available on SVOD platforms that are constantly filtered by the government.
Live streamers are eager to build an audience, and many of them try to do this through crazy and provocative stunts. Because these feeds are more challenging to control, leading Chinese live streaming platforms caught the attention of regulators, who demanded these companies hire teams of censors to purge inappropriate videos from their platforms. But the Chinese live streaming phenomenon has an additional aspect that U.S.-based networks like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat haven’t been able to crack so far: monetization.
Chinese live streaming platforms like YY or Ingkee offer publishers, even the non-celebrities, money for their streams. The viewers can send the streamers virtual “gifts” when they see something they like, while the creators can then trade the value of those “gifts” for actual cash. For instance, Huajiao streamers’ income can average $3,000 to $5,000 a month by broadcasting 3-4 hours a day. It is no wonder a recent report from Tencent showed 43 percent of the live streamers are in this space for the money and not to gain exposure.
What is perhaps most surprising is the adoption of UHD 4K TV sets and content in China, especially when compared to the United States. Some manufacturers we’ve met with have stated that close to 40 percent of their shipments in Mainland China were UHD TV sets. This aligns with the IHS TV Sets Market Tracker that reported two-thirds of big screen TV sets sold in China were UHD sets, compared with a significantly lower number in North America.
Based on these findings, one would assume high penetration rates of 4K content and existence of broadband infrastructure to deliver the high bit rates. However, the internet connection is unstable there. Viewers can experience great connectivity, and a few minutes later, have none at all. To overcome this challenge, OTT providers in China limit their content offering to 4 Mbps — and even less for mobile.
Content providers seem to be well aware of the fluctuating network: During peak hours they proactively limit the video resolution to lower quality SD. UHD requires at least 15 Mbps, which means the network and infrastructure is failing to support those 4K TVs. Indeed a paradox.
There has been a lot of hype in the media on Chinese investments in VR, with predictions for the local market to reach $8.5 billion in the next four years. It’s expected that companies from all over the world will experience the “China VR rush,” and it’s beginning to happen already. Taiwan-based HTC is attempting to establish a $10 billion Virtual Reality Venture Capital Alliance, and plans to open 10,000 VR experience stores across the mainland. Disney-backed Jaunt is launching a VR content company called Jaunt China by partnering with Shanghai Media Group and China Media Capital. But as of today, high-quality and immersive experiences of VR streaming will be difficult to achieve because of bandwidth issues that cause buffering and fluctuating image quality.
That said, most everywhere in China recently, investors and vendors expect to see the two magical letters of “VR” on most presentations or documents. If anyone wants to raise capital now in China, having these two letters in your deck substantially improves chances of getting Chinese backing.
One of the current challenges OTT companies in China are facing is the ability to deploy true UHD content. With subscription fees of 30RMB/$4.50 per month (versus $8 per month for a basic plan on Netflix), offering crisp 4K resolution to their consumers will generate additional revenue via premium subscriptions, as well as attract additional viewers from the cable and satellite base.
The majority of the costs stem from original content creation and licensing, so there is much pressure to improve the bottom line by reducing companies’ CDN (Content Delivery Network) and server-related expenses. While the online video business flourishes, so do vendors’ costs of distributing the content. For example, Baidu-owed iQIYI has been operating at a loss for the past few years, while its bandwidth and marketing expenses increased by 80 percent in 2015.
To find more cost-effective solutions, many content providers turn to Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technologies. By utilizing available storage space on users’ set-top-boxes, Smart TVs and laptops, those companies can significantly reduce their delivery and storage-related expenses. This method is widely adopted in China, while (for obvious reasons) it is less popular outside the country.
Although complex, China is shaping up to be the land of opportunities when it comes to streaming business. The road to success is full of obstacles dictated by the local government, its unique way of doing business and consumer culture. It will be fascinating to see how both domestic and foreign companies will capitalize on this tremendous market opportunity.",2016-09-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/chinastream.jpg?w=738,"jaunt,virtual-reality,video-streaming,china",Lost in translation: Streaming in China
230,Jon Russell,"There’s much anticipation about Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi’s long-awaited entry into the U.S. market. And we don’t have long to wait. Kinda. TechCrunch understands that Xiaomi will begin selling its first mainstream product in the U.S. — an Android set-top box — as soon as next month.
The Mi Box was announced and demoed all the way back in May at Google I/O, but so far the company has remained quiet on when it will go on sale. A source inside Xiaomi, however, told TechCrunch that it will be made available to consumers in the U.S. and other selected markets in “early Q4 2016.” That could indeed mean October.
The price has also been kept quiet to date, but we also understand that the box will cost less than $100.
Xiaomi declined to comment.
The device is very much like the Apple TV, but powered by Android. It is capable of beaming 4K video at 60 FPS with support for Dolby Digital Plus audio playback. In addition, there’s HDMI 2.0a compatibility, a quad-core ARM processor, Mali 450 GPU and 2GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. There’s even a controller for playing Android games on your TV set.
All in all, it promises to offer some serious bang for buck as we’ve come to expect from Xiaomi’s gamut of products, which span laptops, drones, air purifiers, scooters and even a smart rice cooker.
The Mi Box is not a smartphone, of course, but it does represent a significant first foray into the U.S. for Xiaomi, which now sells phones in more than 10 countries worldwide. Xiaomi started out in its native China before expanding across Asia with local operations in places like India, Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia. Last summer it went beyond Asia with a move into Brazil.
All the while, it has avoided the U.S.. Many pundits have speculated that its lack of patents are the major barrier. Xiaomi has bulked up on patents — including a deal with Microsoft — which could hasten its arrival. That’s important since competition is tough in China, where Huawei recently topped Xiaomi on sales, and in other key markets like India.
Xiaomi’s head of international — former Android lead Hugo Barra — recently told Bloomberg that the company is preparing to move into the U.S. smartphone market “in the near future,” but that isn’t likely to be all that soon. The Mi Box will be an interesting first test of the water for Xiaomi, while also helping it build a brand and generate awareness among U.S. consumers.

The round was led by Sequoia India, Indonesia-based Venturra Capital and Susquehanna International Group, with Wavemaker Partners, Beenext, Beenos and Digital Garage also chipping in. Zilingo previously raised $2 million, so this takes its total to $10 million. Not bad for a company that has deliberately kept a low profile.
The days of capital intensive business dominating e-commerce in Southeast Asia are over. In this post-Rocket Internet era, startups are pioneering more sustainable business models having learned the lessons of Lazada, which ran out of money before being bought by Alibaba, and Zalora, the parent of which closed a huge downround following issues raising.
Zilingo is one such company. Founded by former Sequoia India analyst Ankiti Bose (CEO) and ex-Yahoo engineer Dhruv Kapoor (CTO) after a trip to Bangkok stirred an awareness in fashion in Southeast Asia, the service is a marketplace for fashion sellers in Thailand, Singapore and (soon) Indonesia.
There’s a lot to like about Zilingo’s business. Not only did the founders move to Southeast Asia for the potential of the region — where smartphone sales are rising among its 600 million consumers and the digital economy is tipped to hit $200 billion by 2020 — but they are building a sustainable business to boot.
The company targets the long-tail of vendors, otherwise seen as too small for larger e-commerce companies, the kind that exhibit and sell offline within markets and malls across Southeast Asia.

Why the focus on the smaller retailers when others have deemed them too much hassle?
Well, Zilingo believes that Southeast Asian fashion sellers — such as those in Bangkok that attract weekend shoppers from Singapore, China and elsewhere — have vast potential online that nobody else is catering to. On the business side, it estimates that small sellers collectively account for 60 percent of retails sales in the region. Zilingo pegs the entire long-tail fashion and beauty industry at around $20 billion per year.
“We saw that there was 60 percent of the fashion market being catered to by SMEs, but none of these had ability to sell online at scale [and] all other online businesses wanted to get sales or push their own brands,” Bose said.
Zilingo lets its sellers — it claims to have over 2,000 right now — price their goods as they’d like, it simply takes 10-15 percent of any sale. That is enough to cover costs since Zilingo itself doesn’t house product. Indeed, once it has covered promotion, packaging and other costs, that boils down to a positive margin of one to two percent, Bose told TechCrunch in an interview.
That translates to positive unit economics and in the near future, she admitted, higher GMV — the total volume of sales on the Zilingo platform — and user growth could increase those take home margins to four or five percent.
“Never once did we sacrifice the unit economics for GMV to order to get a better valuation for fundraising,” she added. “We said: ‘Hey, that is a bad business.’ Instead, we let the business pay for the business and money we raise covers salaries, marketing, etc. Essentially we don’t end up burning a lot of money, we might even get profitable soon, and this excess cash allows us to aggressively market ourselves.”
Zilingo has one other particularly notable feature. Kapoor and his Bangalore-based tech team built out a seller management platform which helps small retailers — who again are often dismissed as not being worth it for larger platforms — formally organize their business.
Zilingo’s software is free and it also hooks up to other e-commerce platforms, such as Zalora, which Bose believes helps establish relationships with new sellers and maintain those with existing ones.
“It offers inventory management, API for logistics, bank account integration and we are adding working capital loans and other features,” she explained. “We’ve created a nice moat around our business to give us access to 60 percent of the market supply. We think we can get fairly unrestricted access to the long tail.”

With this funding in the bank, Zilingo plans to launch for sellers in Indonesia — Bose, who currently resides in Bangkok, will move to Jakarta to get a proper feel for the local market — and ramp up its technology and marketing.
Indeed, one of the early fruits of that push is the new look Zilingo mobile app which includes more video coverage of products. That’s designed to rotate on a three-day schedule that, in theory, has customers coming back to check out what is hot.
“We want users to come on board to discover fashion trends,” Bose explained. “Even if they shop just once a month, that would be great. Our userbase is 23-40 years old, but we want younger users [and] they engage way better with video than static images.”
Right now, over 80 percent of Zilingo’s sales are within Southeast Asia itself, but Bose revealed that there has been interest from wholesalers in Europe and Asia Pacific who see the service as a convenient and cost effective way to move product into their markets for resale. Right now, she clarified, there is no plan to offer a different kind of service to accommodate this demand, but that could change if the future if supply is high enough.
The immediate focus is more local, to take on competitors like Zalora and newly-minted Orami.
“We want to get more sellers, expand into Indonesia and win the fashion commerce market,” Bose said.",2016-09-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screenshot-2016-09-06-13-33-08.png?w=738,"venturra-capital,sequoia",Zilingo lands $8M for its marketplace for fashion sellers in Southeast Asia
232,Jon Russell,"Garena, the games firm that is Southeast Asia’s most valuable tech startup, has closed additional funding from three new investors. They are SeaTown Holdings International, an affiliate of Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek, Indonesia’s GDP Venture, and Mistletoe, a Japan-based fund from Taizo Son, the younger brother of SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son.
The amount raised was not disclosed, and Singapore-headquartered Garena did not reveal a post-money valuation.
That last valuation was $3.75 billion following a $170 million funding round in March from Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the Malaysian government’s strategic investment fund, and Chinese tech giant Tencent, a long-term, existing investor. The company has raised over $500 million to date. Its other investors include General Atlantic, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Keytone Ventures, and Skype co-founder Toivo Annus.
Garena is best known for the gaming business it started in 2009, which accounts for most of its revenue, but today it also operates a payment service called AirPay and social commerce app called Shopee. Garena said in a statement that its annual revenue surpassed $300 million last year, a figure that it claimed represents “compound annual revenue growth of more than 95 percent over the past five years.” It didn’t reveal its profit/loss for 2015.
While Garena didn’t say a whole lot in this announcement, it did reveal some notable figures for its two newest ventures.
Shopee, an e-commerce app that latches on to the popularity of social media to enable social commerce, has reached 1.4 million sellers and “annualised” GMV of $1.3 billion. That sounds impressive — Rocket Internet’s Lazada crossed $1 billion GMV before being acquired by Alibaba in a multi-billion dollar deal earlier this year — but Shopee’s GMV figure is being calculated using monthly figures rather than an entire year of sales, as Garena president Nick Nash told me when I interviewed him at a tech event in Bangkok in July. In other words, if you scale one of your best months of business, you can get stellar “annualized” sales. (Although, to be fair to Garena, Shopee has been running less than a year — but the effect is the same.)
In addition, for now Shopee isn’t charging merchants for its service. Subsidization is normal, but it does distort some figures. Ultimately, Shopee’s progress is promising, but the figure are a stretch.
The same applies to AirPay, which Garena said “now has an annualized gross transaction value exceeding US$510 million.” Impressive, again, but important to bear in mind that it is an “annualized” figure.
Nonetheless, it is impossible to avoid the fact that Garena is putting its significant weight into social commerce and payments, two areas in Southeast Asia that many companies, including Alibaba and Facebook, are making a big play for. With over 600 million consumers and growing smartphone sales, the region is often touted as a market with the potential to be hugely lucrative for internet companies.
“We are proud to welcome three of Asia’s most respected investment firms to Garena,” Garena founder, chairman and group CEO Forrest Li said in a statement. “Their insights and connectivity across the region will support and accelerate our mission to ‘connect the dots’ for our customers.”
Son, who made his name with Yahoo Japan by founding gaming giant Gungho, added: “It’s crucial to for the world to have companies which create large positive impacts in diverse fields to brighten the prospect of our future. I am very proud of the work Garena is doing and look forward to many years of partnership.”

233,Ingrid Lunden,"One of the biggest tech deals this year — and the biggest ever in the UK — has now closed. Today, Softbank announced that it has completed its acquisition of ARM Holdings, the semiconductor firm that it said in July it would acquire for £24 billion in cash (around $32 billion in today’s currency, $31 billion at the time of the deal), in order to make a big jump into IoT. As a result, ARM will be delisted from the LSE effective September 6. Softbank has said that it plans to run the company as a standalone business.
The news comes a couple of days after the deal received its final required regulatory clearance, paving the way for the close.
“Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition, SBG purchased all of ARM’s issued and to be issued shares (excluding any ARM shares already owned by SBG or an SBG subsidiary) for cash, for a total acquisition price amounting to approximately GBP 24.0 billion (approximately USD 31.0 billion or JPY 3.3 trillion),” the company noted in its announcement. “Subsequent to the completion of the Acquisition, ARM will be delisted from the London Stock Exchange as of September 6, 2016 (GMT) and will cease to be a listed company.”
Softbank will announce the financial and operational impact of the consolidation once it is verified, it said. The companies will start to consolidate their financials as of today.
As we reported at the time the deal was announced, the acquisition of ARM is a big play by Softbank to jump into Internet of Things technology, a sizeable pivot for a company that has made its name more recently around mobile and fixed internet services for consumers, and large investments in outsized- and fast-growing tech companies.
Masayoshi Son, Softbank’s CEO and founder, earlier this year surprised the industry when he announced that he would not retire as he had previously planned, and the acquisition — which he said took took only two weeks to initiate and close — is, in a sense, a mark of how he plans to run things in this next phase of the company’s life.
It’s in contrast to a different spin on the deal, where some believed that Softbank opportunistically swooped in on ARM because of the decline of the pound in the wake of the Brexit vote. That referendum, where the majority of voters in Britain said they wanted the UK to leave the European Union, caused a huge reverberation in the UK economy, and a drop in the value of the British pound.
“Brexit did not affect my decision,” Masayoshi Son said in a press conference the day the deal was announced. “Many people many are worried about Brexit and concerned about he complex situation of the country, but good or bad… I did not make the investment because of Brexit.”
He added that although the price of the pound declined by about 16% in the two weeks that Softbank and ARM negotiated, but ARM’s share price went up by about the same amount, meaning they cancelled each other out. There were other financial factors in play as well: in the weeks leading up to the deal, Softbank sold a chunk of its Alibaba stake and its stake in Supercell, and today it announced a large loan for some $9 billion (¥1 trillion). “This is not opportunistic about the currency,” he joked. “I have wanted to do this but was waiting for the cash to come in.
“I’m not investing in a distressed asset,” he continued. “I’m investing in a paradigm shift…. that’s my passion, and that’s my view.”
If Softbank was in the thick of it at the “beginning of the PC internet,” in Masayoshi’s words (he invested in via Yahoo when it only had 16 employees), and then doubled down on mobile (by way of Softbank’s investments in various mobile companies and acquisition of Sprint) then — he believes — IoT is the natural progression of that.
For ARM, the company has been been one of the UK’s biggest tech success stories. Its growth coincided with the rise of smartphones and its chip reference designs are used by the likes of Apple and many others.
That smartphone business is still there — just last month, longtime chip rival Intel, interestingly, announced it would license ARM’s technology for smartphone chips, in hopes of boosting its own smartphone chipmaking business (in this case to grow business with third-party smartphone chipmakers).
But more importantly, ARM has been shifting its own business to IoT for several years now, in anticipation of a time when growth of its bread-and-butter business might slow down.
(And indeed, that is exactly what’s happening: growth of smartphone sales is now essentially flat as penetration has reached saturation in many markets, and people are waiting longer to replace the phones they already have.)
While there are definitely a lot of products out there now that are “connected” — that is, many ordinary “dumb” objects like refrigerators, locks and lights can now be controlled wirelessly by way of internet connections — the bigger market for IoT products and services is really only just at its start. ARM — and now Softbank — hope that by getting into the game early, they can dominate much as ARM has done in smartphones.",2016-09-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/iotglobe.jpg?w=738,"iot,softbank,arm-holdings",Softbank has completed its £24B cash acquisition of ARM Holdings
234,Ingrid Lunden,"After raising $4.5 billion at a $60 billion valuation earlier this year, Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial — which operates the Alipay payments service — is hungry to put some of that money to use to build out its business. The company, alongside key Alibaba investor Primavera Capital, is investing $460 million into Yum China, a new spinout from Yum Brands — the parent company of fast food giants KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.
Primavera will be putting in $410 million, while Ant Financial will be putting in $50 million. And going hand-in-hand with the capital from Primavera and Ant Financial, Yum China plans to spin off from Yum Brands on October 31 of this year and will operate all of Yum’s brands in the country. Yum China will trade on the NYSE under the ticker YUMC starting November 1.
This is a strategic investment for Ant Financial, as part of its bigger “online to offline” strategy. OTO is a catchphrase that is used a lot in Asia and refers to the plethora of opportunities in the market to apply tech solutions to non-tech businesses, providing growth opportunities for both.
In the case of Yum, the company plans to incorporate Alipay mobile and point of sale payment services across KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants, and also help them develop and run consumer loyalty programs and other commerce initiatives.
“Through this collaboration, we aim to help Yum China provide world-class mobile payment services for tens of millions of customers across its brands. These services include hassle-free Alipay for customers to help shorten queues at the cashier as well as membership solutions for Yum China designed to help manage their customer relations and promotions,” said Eric Jing, President of Ant Financial Services Group, in a statement. It’s already been working with some of the restaurants in the group ahead of this. “Leveraging our Big Data capabilities, KFC and Pizza Hut witnessed promising marketing results through their promotion on multiple Ant Financial platforms. We look forward to further collaborating with Yum China in the future.”
This is not Ant’s first investment into the food vertical. Alongside Alibaba, it made a $1.25 billion investment into Ele.me, China’s equivalent of GrubHub/Seamless, earlier this year.
Past non-food investments that Ant has made include on-demand transportation giant Didi Chuxing, media business 36Kr, and India’s Paytm, a payments company that is in the process of closing a fresh $300 million round that sources have confirmed to us will include further investment from Ant Financial.
Food is a very obvious category to get more attention from Ant Financial: it’s a business that, by its nature, lends itself to repeat transactions, and in this case Ant is investing into some of the more successful and proven brands within that space.
By collaborating both on payments and other programs like loyalty and reward services, as well as analytics, it helps Ant build a more diversified range of revenue streams, which could help it with its own eventual public listing.
“We have long admired the Yum China business and are looking forward to collaborating with the Board and management to realize the company’s full potential,” said Dr. Fred Hu, the founder Primavera who will become Yum China’s non-executive chairman. “Yum China is an established leader in the retail and restaurant industry which we believe is poised for continued strong growth and unit expansion as cities across China invest in new transportation hubs, shopping malls and other physical and electronic infrastructure that will support consumption. I look forward to leading the Board of Directors of Yum China in its new and exciting chapter as an independent company.”
“Primavera and Ant Financial both have deep insights into the rapid urbanization and digital transformation which is driving the evolution of China’s economy, and we are excited about their investment into Yum China,” said Micky Pant, Chief Executive Officer of Yum China, in a statement. “The investment is a clear endorsement of our business strategy and growth potential, and their diverse experience and relationships will be extremely beneficial. Dr. Hu’s extensive market insights and experience scaling businesses in China will be invaluable as we move to expand the footprint of our brands. In addition, Yum China is already the leading restaurant company for cashless payment systems in China, and we expect Ant Financial can provide further unique insights to help us better connect with consumers through mobile technology.”
Yum isn’t the only fast-food giant that is looking to raise its game and compete better by incorporating more tech into its operations: Burger King owner RBI last year acqui-hired the team behind startup Brewster (which had originally built a clever contacts management app) to rethink and recast the company’s approach to how it used new innovations in technology to improve its fortunes and get people eating more Whoppers.
Building separate Chinese entities is a common route for larger international brands, who use the structure to raise more capital locally — or provide opportunities for international investors to focus specifically on the China opportunity — and subsequently plough that money more directly in regionally specific initiatives. It’s also a way of creating a more local structure that can better navigate regulatory and competitive waters.
Not all those entities remain independent, though: earlier this summer Uber China announced it would merge with its big rival Didi Chuxing, although that deal is now being questioned by China’s antitrust regulators.",2016-09-02,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/5103683633_e1e4a5247a_b.jpg?w=738,"food,ant-financial","Primavera, Alibaba’s Ant Financial dunk $460M into KFC owner’s spinout Yum China"
235,Jon Russell,"Smartphone sales have peaked, but if you’re looking for places in the world where the trend is still upwards and the surface is just being scratched, then Southeast Asia is one region to keep in mind.
Sales growth may be slowing in the U.S., Europe and China where most consumers already own a smartphone, but the revolution is still very much underway in emerging markets. India is one such place — smartphone sales were up 17 percent year-on-year in the most recent quarter — and IDC reported this week that sales in Southeast Asia rose 6.5 percent year-on-year. That’s smaller than India, sure, but the movement is upwards.
Southeast Asia counts a cumulative population of more than 600 million, yet smartphone sales across its seven largest countries reached 100 million (for the first time) in 2015. There’s clearly a lot of growth to be had here, and sales touched 28 million in Q2 2016 — up a hefty 18.1 percent on the previous quarter.
IDC didn’t break out its figures based on countries, but we know that Indonesia is the largest market, followed by Thailand and the Philippines — they accounted for 29, 22 and 14 percent of sales in 2015, respectively.

There are some interesting insights to glean from IDC’s Q2 2016 data.
Some 68 percent of devices sold were priced below $150. Samsung’s Galaxy J series topped the charts, and gave the Korean phone maker the lead with 20 percent of smartphone sales across Southeast Asia in the three-month period.
Like India, Chinese brands are providing fierce competition in the region, with Oppo sitting in second with 12 percent marketshare. Thai operator True came in second — which is remarkable given it sells phones in just one country — ahead of Asus and India’s Lava, which is also working closely with operators in Thailand.
Finally, while the rest of the world has moved to 4G (and beyond) 3G devices still dominate in Southeast Asia. Part of that is again due to the influence of Thailand, where operators are migrating 2G customers to 3G with some very attractive deals — the same trend that propelled True and Lava’s marketshare.
Growth is slower in Southeast Asia, but the longer term potential is high. Earlier this year, a report co-authored by Google and Temasek found that 3.8 million people come online for the first time in the region each month. Mobile is the primary access platform, and IDC foresees that over time more expensive devices will see sales grow as those new internet users seek to upgrade their smartphone.
“With the rise of replacement users in Southeast Asia seeking to upgrade their handsets in order to cope with the latest usage and apps, vendors will need to increase the market availability of handsets with better specs that come at slightly higher prices, which the buyers are willing to invest in for a better usage experience,” said IDC analyst Jensen Ooi.
Ooi added that we can expect Chinese smartphone makers to attack the $150-250 market segment aggressively in response to that demand.",2016-09-01,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/southeast-asia-map.jpg?w=738,"idc,smartphone,southeast-asia","Smartphone sales jump 6.5% in Southeast Asia, but sub-$150 devices rule"
236,Jon Russell,"Less than a month after raising $35 million in new financing, social commerce and classifieds startup Carousell has made its first acquisition. The Singapore-based company has picked up most of the team from Watch Over Me, a safety app for principally for women that is based in Malaysia, in an acquihire deal that beefs up its engineering chops.
This is very much a talent grab. Watch Over Me had a nine-person team, and five members of the startup’s product team have joined Carousell as part of the deal, while CEO Xin-Ci Chin is stepping aboard as a part-time consultant to help with “CRM infrastructure and processes.”
“As the acquihire required a relocation to Singapore, not all [of the Watch Over Me team] wanted to be a part of it,” Carousell explained to TechCrunch in a statement.
Watch Over Me, which claimed 250,000 registered users, will be open sourced to Github soon in a move that Chin hopes may be of benefit to others looking to develop safety apps.
The deal size is undisclosed, but a source close to negotiations told TechCrunch that it was a mix of cash and shares. Essentially, Watch Over Me’s investors, who include SEGNEL Ventures, Quest Ventures and a number of angels, earned their money back.
Carousell, for its part, didn’t confirm additional details.
“As this is an acquihire, we believe that the focus should be on the talented individuals joining our product and engineering team, instead of the financial terms of the agreement. Their expertise in building trust and safety, and location services are critical to improving community engagement, and accelerating our growth into new markets,” CEO Siu Rui Quek told us.
In tandem with this agreement, Carousell has hired Andrius Baranauskas, who helped second-hand fashion startup Vinted reach 11 million members in eight countries, as its head of product. This is its second major hire of the year following the addition of Airbnb’s Southeast Asia lead JJ Chai to manage its international expansion plans.
Four-year-old Carousell operates a mobile listings and classified service — which is much like a Craigslist for mobile — in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia. Speaking to TechCrunch last month when it closed its Series B financing, Quek said the company is planning to expand in Asia and potentially make a foray outside of the continent, too. Hiring more staff, particularly in technical positions, is a priority in order to make that happen — and that could mean more M&A activity.
“We aim to double the team by the end of 2016. Whether it’s through acquihires or individual hires, we’re looking for teams or people who are interested in exploring how machine learning, data science and AI can help to improve discoverability and overall community engagement,” the company said.

237,Jon Russell,"India-based home design and furnishing company Livspace has closed a $15 million Series B round which will be used to fund an expansion into new cities.
Bessemer Venture Partners led the round, which also included participation from Jungle Ventures and Helion — all three are existing investors. This new round takes Livspace, which was founded in December 2014, to more than $27 million from investors to date. Prior to today, its most recent raise was $8 million one year ago, which itself was an extension to an initial $4.6 million Series A that closed in early 2015.
Livspace aims to make designing and outfitting a home as easy as buying groceries or other products online. To do that, it connects homeowners and would-be homeowners with designers. It also includes e-commerce integration with modular kitchen and wardrobe systems, which, Livspace revealed, accounts for over half of the company’s revenue.
With this new money in the bank, the company is targeting a number of lofty goals — it wants to reach $100 million in annual revenue by the end of 2017, and to get there it is planning to expand its reach in India. Livspace currently serves Bangalore, but it is aiming to expand to Noida, Gurgaon and Mumbai this year. Next year, it is targeting moves into Pune and Hyderabad.
The startup also wants to get into VR — a medium that we know can be hugely powerful for home design, as U.S-based startup Modsy is proving. Livspace said it will set up new design studios equipped with VR technology to provide a more immersive experience to help users picture their new home designers before they are made.
The end goal, Livspace said, is to make it possible to outfit a house within 12 weeks, or complete installations within eight weeks, all via its online platform.
“We are very impressed with the pioneering approach, traction, and commercial scale achieved by Livspace, in a short period of time. Livspace is already India’s largest online home design company and continues to see tremendous demand side scale due to the recently announced home design automation platform,” Vishal Gupta, managing director of Bessemer Venture Partners said in a statement.

238,Jon Russell,"Grocery on-demand service HappyFresh has delivered a mixed bag of news today. The company has withdrawn from two markets in Asia and announced an undisclosed Series B funding round as it aims to become a sustainable business .
The company launched 18 months ago to become the first service of its type — the Instacart model from the U.S. — in Southeast Asia. It raised a $12 million Series A round one year, but all CEO and co-founder Markus Bihler would say of this new round is that the amount is higher. The financing is led by Samena Capital, a Dubai-based PE firm with over $1 billion under management across frontier markets in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Previous backers Vertex Ventures and Sinar Mas Digital Ventures, who led the Series A, also took part.
On the operational front, HappyFresh has closed its business in Taiwan and the Philippines. Instead, it will “concentrate” on its three other markets: Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, Bihler said. These changes were communicated to staff of nearly 1,000 on Friday, and they will mean that an undisclosed number of employees will be laid off, with some relocated.
“We, of course, will provide job opportunities across the region but not everyone has the flexibility,” Bihler told TechCrunch in an interview, adding that the change “underlines our focus on sustainability and profitability across the region.”
There had been rumors that HappyFresh was trying to raise again, and not disclosing the size of the round could suggest that it isn’t as large as Bihler and his team were hoping for.
Bihler, by contrast, called the new funding “a strong vote of confidence for investors of this calibre to embrace the HappyFresh vision,” and he is particularly bullish about tapping into Samena Capital’s experience in emerging markets.
HappyFresh is designed to take weekly shopping online in Southeast Asia, a region of more than 600 million consumers where digital spending is tipped to reach $200 billion per year by 2025.
The company partners with offline retailers to sell their products through the internet and mobile apps using an on-demand model that brings delivery to your door inside one hour. Global retail giants Tesco and Carrefour are among the partners in the region. It literally sends its own personal shoppers to shop for you, with the option to trust them to pick replacements where needed or call you up to confirm switches.

The company makes money three ways.
Charging customers a small delivery fee — that varies across markets but, for example, it is 60THB ($2) in Bangkok, Thailand, where I am based. It also takes a fee from its retail partners for helping them sell product through its platform. Finally, it operates an analytics and data business — HappyData — through which retailers and brands can promote their products and services via promotions, sponsorships and advertising on the HappyFresh platform.
Bihler declined to discuss the specific revenue of each monetization stream, nor would he say what fraction of overall revenue each accounts for.
“All three are significant revenue streams for us,” he said.
HappyData, the analytics business, is already a profitable operation, Bihler added. Rather than spinning it into a separate business, the idea is to keep it part of the HappyFresh “ecosystem.” Its service — which include insight into product purchases, what consumers look at, and other behavioral data — is offered free to retail partners, but brands and others must pay. That business is modeled on Dunnhumby, the Tesco-owned consumer insights unit valued at more than $1 billion.
Looking to the future, Bihler said his objective is to scale all these revenue streams in the HappyFresh business and push to make the overall company profitable. He said there is a target for profitability, but declined to share it publicly.

Southeast Asia has oodles of potential for online consumer businesses, but, as many have found out the hard way, the growth curve for increasing the number of internet users in the region is a long one. Lazada, an online retailer modeled on Amazon and backed by Rocket Internet, ran out of money before Alibaba invested $1 billion to take a majority share of its business earlier this year.
The fact remains that online represents less than three percent of all commerce in Southeast Asia. While that is projected to grow 10-fold over the next decade, any company building a consumer internet business has to deal with growing the pie — which can be frustratingly slow.
“We don’t see our own partners as competition” even though they run their own online stores alongside HappyFresh, Bihler said. “The biggest point is the education of the market, and the moving of consumer behavior from offline to online.”
“If we can help push the online penetration rate of our whole industry up by a couple of decimals, then we’ve done good for ourselves and our customers,” he added.",2016-08-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/happyfreshs-fleet-of-delivery-vehicles.jpg?w=738,"sinar-mas-digital-ventures,vertex-ventures,happyfresh","Southeast Asia e-grocer HappyFresh exits two markets, raises undisclosed Series B"
239,Romain Dillet,"Twitter has performed incredibly well on the stock market for the past couple of weeks. But the honeymoon is over as it’s back to reality and correction time. Twitter shares are currently down 20.06 percent to $19.88 compared to yesterday’s closing price of $24.87.
So what happened? Recode has published multiple reports saying that many of the companies that were looking at Twitter for a potential acquisition backed away from the deal. Google, Apple and Disney don’t want to buy Twitter anymore.
Salesforce seems to be the last remaining suitor. The company already tried to buy LinkedIn, but Microsoft ended up acquiring the professional social network.
But Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also hinted that Salesforce might not be buying Twitter after all. He made multiple comments about it in an investor meeting today.
All of this led Twitter to the current situation. Overnight, more than $2 billion in market capitalization disappeared. Maybe a lower price tag might convince a secret buyer that Twitter is worth buying.
Twitter went public in November 2013 and was worth $31 billion at the end of the first trading day. Today, Twitter is worth a little less than $15 billion. Back in June, Twitter was even more affordable with a market capitalization of $10 billion.
And for now, it seems like Twitter will have to operate as a standalone company.

240,Sarah Perez,"Capital One is making another acquisition in the fintech space, this time snatching up the price tracking service Paribus, which helps online shoppers get automatic refunds when prices drop on items they purchased. Deal terms were not disclosed, but the acquisition involves bring both the team and the technology itself to Capital One.
Launched in the Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2015, Paribus’ idea was to automate the process of following up on past purchases to see if shoppers could request a refund from the online retailer. Many retailers offer post-purchase price matches, but most consumers don’t bother to watch the prices fluctuate after they complete the checkout process.
Paribus instead integrates with your email provider – like Gmail, Outlook, or Yahoo, for example – in order to scan your inbox for receipts of online purchases. When it finds one, it will then watch the item for a price drop within the store’s price match claim window. The service works with a number of online retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s, Bonobos, J.Crew, NewEgg, Costco, Staples, Kohl’s, and many others.

The startup has raised $2.22 million in outside funding to date and has a team of 12, all of whom are now joining Capital One. Paribus founders Eric Glyman and Karim Atiyeh are joining Capital One as Senior Directors in U.S. Card.
“We are incredibly impressed with the level of talent, the innovative technology that they have and are developing, and their steadfast mission to deliver effortless experiences for its users,” says Emilia Lopez, Managing Vice President, U.S. Card at Capital One, about why the company decided to snatch up Paribus.
“Our focus right now is on merging Paribus into the broader Capital One family, and adding the Paribus product into the broader set of technology and tools aimed at making people’s lives easier, like CreditWise and Second Look,” Lopez added.
Paribus had over 700,000 users at the time of the deal, and co-founder Glyman says the team was happy with the direction and growth over the past year, though he would not speak to revenue details.
“Like many startups that have grown as quickly as we have in one year’s time, we had many paths,” Glyman says. “We chose to join forces with Capital One. We could not be more excited to supercharge our efforts within an innovative technology company, and are energized by a combined focus on building great technology for consumers.”
Paribus will not be shutting down following the acquisition, but instead will work along with Capital One to expand into new money-saving areas. The company was already working on a new product that would focus on credit card price protection, so that seems to be a likely next step for business.
The acquisition is now one of several Capital One has made in recent years to beef up its tech talent and offer more modern, innovative services to customers. It also acquired startups like Bundle, BankOns, Adaptive Path, and last year, Level Money and Monsoon.",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/paribus17.jpg?w=738,"battlefield,price-drops,paribus,capital-one",Capital One acquires online price tracker Paribus
241,John Biggs,"Fabricating a circuit board isn’t tough but it takes a while. The back and forth, the bugs, and all of the shipping costs can turn a small project into a big problem. That’s why Botfactory raised $1.3 million to stick a PCB printer on your desk.
Founded by NYU grad students Nicolas Vansnick and Carlos Ospina along with NYU professor Michael Knox, BotFactory came about when Vansnick and Ospina needed to make a PCB for a class project. Nearly every student in the class failed because they couldn’t get circuit boards made in time and each iteration took weeks to complete.
“This lesson was tremendous – if this was a problem that was typical for any project, then the solution would revolutionize how electronics could be prototyped and fabricated,” said Vansnick. “Up until then, everybody had been trying to miniaturize electronics and chips, but not the processes that are employed to create PCBs.”
Their first product, the Squink, took off. They’ve already shipped 106 machines and they’re on track to ship a dozen more. The Squink is obviously a niche product – not all of us need pick-and-place machines in the office – but it’s a great start for a fascinating project. The kit uses conductive ink or solder and can place components right on a circuit board.
They raised $1.3 million from NY Angels as a lead investor.
“Ultimately our goal is to provide a desktop machine that can allow someone to make a board here and now, at a relatively low cost,” said Vansnick.
Traditionally, PCB manufacture consisted of sending a schematic to a fabricator in Asia and then waiting for the board or single chip to be sent back. Any bugs in the system take another few weeks to fix and then another few weeks to ship. By moving the entire process to a piece of hardware in your office the lads at BotFactory fixed a massive time sink.
The basic Squink costs $3,199 and more advanced versions cost up to $4,499. Again, it’s not quite in the real of maker pricing but, as Han Solo said to Spock, “Away put your weapon, these are the bots you seek [for making PCBs at home]!”",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/product_template_616.jpeg?w=738,"electrical-engineering,pcb,pollution",BotFactory raises $1.3 million to help you build circuit boards on your desktop
242,Anthony Ha,"Animoto is launching a new product for businesses that want to post their own marketing videos for Facebook and other social networks — but don’t necessarily have the team or the skills needed to create something slick.
The company already offers products that automatically assemble your photos and videos into a video slideshow, and it’s been adding more tools for businesses. However, Animoto President Jason Hsiao said the team saw an opportunity to build a new product designed for this specific need.
“We’ve been adding business-related features to our existing product, but it really kind of got to this tipping point a few years back, where we decided to just step back and see all this activity going on with business videos,” Hsiao told me. “Everyone’s now trying to create their own videos, so we really wanted to try to tackle this head on.”
CTO Stevie Clifton added that the new product was inspired by drag-and-drop website builders — in the same way that companies like Squarespace and Weebly allow you to create a website without any coding, Animoto’s Marketing Video Builder should allow you create a video without a big production budget or extensive editing skills.
The key to this approach, Clifton said, is realizing that most marketing videos can be broken down into a number of common “components,” which can then be stitched together into a video. That means the Marketing Video Builder’s interface looks pretty different from the other video editors you might have seen.
“People who aren’t video editors, they don’t want a timeline,” Hsiao said.
So he and Clifton demonstrated creating a video for me — it took only a couple of minutes to create a professional-looking marketing video. You choose from a number of possible templates, which are basically storyboards built from those smaller components. For each component, you just follow the instructions, which might mean uploading a certain number of photos or videos.
The text and fonts can be edited, you can add voiceover to each piece and you can also customize the video by adding or removing components.
“You don’t want it to look like a cookie-cutter thing,” Clifton said. “We got that direct feedback from our customers who were  worried about starting from a storyboard: ‘I don’t want mine to look like everyone else’s.’ It’s really easy to make customizations that totally depart from what the storyboard is, and [tailor] it to their own needs.”
Once you’ve created the video, you can upload it to any websites and social networks that you choose. While Animoto doesn’t offer any specific tools to customize the video to different services — say, creating one cut for Facebook and another for Instagram — Clifton said, “We’ve started to look at that problem. We don’t know exactly what our solution is going to be.”

And while Animoto’s focus does seem to be shifting to businesses, Clifton and Hsiao said the existing slideshow product isn’t going anywhere.
“If you’re doing anything heavily photo-based, or if it’s a consumer video, [the slideshow builder] is still better than anything out there,” Hsiao said.",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/drag_and_drop.jpg?w=738,"social-video,animoto",Animoto gives businesses an easy way to create social videos
243,Jordan Crook,"Netflix is continuing its slow crawl into the movie theater, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.
The WSJ says that Netflix has struck a deal with iPic Entertainment, a luxury theater chain, that would allow Netflix to feature 10 of its original films in theaters on the same day that they launch across Netflix.
iPic has venues in 15 markets across the U.S., but the report says that this latest Netflix deal will initially only put Netflix Originals in theaters in Los Angeles and New York, with the option to expand to other locations. Other terms of the deal, like revenue split on tickets, were not disclosed.
This is not the first time that Netflix has angled to get its original films on the big screen. In 2015, Netflix made an effort to prove that the quality of its films was on par with other theatrical releases, and tried to release Beasts of No Nation in theaters.
However, as the Verge points out, theater owners aren’t big fans of simultaneous releases, and some theaters refused to screen the film.
The deal with iPic is interesting because it represents Netflix’s first long-term deal with a theater chain. But that doesn’t mean that theater owners are convinced.
Variety reported on a statement made by NATO (National Association of Theater Owners) President John Fithian, in which he expressed disapproval over the deal.
Fithian had this to say:
Obviously, Netflix has a bit of an uphill battle when it comes to distribution of its original content in movie theaters. But the deal with iPic Entertainment is a clear step in the right direction.",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-200268224.jpg?w=738,,Netflix signs deal with theater chain to put original films on the big screen
244,Megan Rose Dickey,"It’s not like there’s a shortage of lunch options for corporate employees, but that’s not stopping on-demand food startup Munchery from testing its luck with corporate lunch delivery. Today, Munchery will start delivering lunch to office employees in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and New York. This is an extension of Munchery’s @Work initiative, which already delivers dinner to over 50 companies.
As on-demand companies have started to struggle, including Munchery, the company has been trying out different approaches the food market in the last year or so. Last October, Munchery started delivering meal recipes and ingredients for people who want to cook. Then in April, Munchery launched an $8.95 a month subscription plan for people who order several times a month. Unlike Munchery’s core consumer offering, most of Munchery’s lunch meals will be ready to eat, Munchery CEO Tri Tran (pictured above) told me.
“We will have a mix of both foods that are ready to eat and items that could use heating up,” Tran said.
As I previously mentioned, tech companies have been tackling corporate lunch for a while. That includes startups like ZeroCater and Zesty, which TechCrunch’s uses for lunch on Tuesdays and Thursdays. What makes Munchery’s offering from the rest, Tran says, is the absence of aluminum trays and the addition of choice.
With Zesty, for example, the pre-selected food shows up usually around 11:45am in a few aluminum trays. You have no say over what you’re going to eat that day, so you just have to hope it’s good and that you’re not allergic to it. Oh, and if your co-workers are vultures, it’ll all be gone by the time you get out of your meeting.
With Munchery, employees can select what they want to eat for lunch the night before. Or, an office manager can place an order on behalf of a few people or on behalf of everyone. Unlike Zesty, all of the food is individually packaged.
“Unlike restaurant catering, that portion you ordered will still be there for you,” Tran said.
The default membership enables employers to order once a month, but the offering is flexible, Tran said. Munchery has been testing the program since April with a handful of beta customers. On average, employers are ordering lunch for their employees once a week.
“We will be satisfied if an office gets us on average once a week,” Tran said.",2016-10-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/munchery-ceo-and-co-founder-tri-tran-e1475709492991.jpg?w=738,munchery,Munchery is getting into the corporate lunch game
245,Haje Jan Kamps,"Story Terrace today announced it has raised £500,000 ($640,000) to continue its mission to tell the stories of those you love. The customers are typically kids who want to buy a highly personal gift for their parents around an anniversary, or startup founders who have recently exited a business and want to set the record straight — or at least firmly crooked.
“We are building technology to assist our writers in completing the books,” Rutger Bruining, founder and CEO of Story Terrace, tells me. “The bottleneck for us is the design process and we are investing some of the money we raised into automating the process. We want to turn photos and text into a print-ready book.”
Bruining assures me that the automation isn’t because he has a passionate hatred for designers, but because he wants to be able to offer the books to his customers faster than even the most dizzy-fingered of designers is able to accomplish.
“Story Terrace addresses a large, universal problem: Stories fade and are not passed on from generation to generation,” says Rafael Ortiz, who led Story Terrace’s angel round. “Their offering is unique and gaining traction. I’ve been impressed with the team’s understanding of their customers and the progress they are making with the platform. Story Terrace can print a limited number of beautiful books at a fraction of what would have been possible 10 years ago. Altogether, this creates an opportunity to develop a large market.”

“Historically there have always been more people who want to be journalists and writers than the amount of work going around. We have the bonus of being more fun than writing web copy for someone’s website,” Bruining laughs when I query how the company is able to find writers who are willing to do the job at a price point that makes sense. “The interviews are fun and ultimately the work that is being done here is meaningful. We’re in the business of creating family heirlooms that are cherished for generations. It means we are able to attract some really good writers.”

246,Anthony Ha,"Just in time for New York Comic Con, Madefire is announcing that it has raised $6.5 million in Series B funding.
Madefire co-founder and CEO Ben Wolstenholme said the funding — which was led by Santa Monica-based Plus Capital — will help his company build more connections with the media and entertainment world. It’s not that Madefire (which previously raised $6.3 million from investors including True Ventures) was totally lacking in those relationships before, but Wolstenholme said the company is “moving from being all about building technology” to building up a big content library as well.
The firm connected Madefire with some of the other big names who ended up investing in the Series B, including Kevin Spacey (!) and Drake (!!). Visual effects studio Framestore also participated in the round — Wolstenholme said Framestore will be building Madefire-specific content.
“I think the Madefire team are visionaries, building a platform that creates impactful ways to tell stories,” said Plus Capital founder and managing partner Adam Lilling in a statement. “At Plus, we believe Madefire has one of the best platforms for creators to introduce and experiment with their IP, and scale their audience so creators can have more control over their future.”
While Comixology (now owned by Amazon) remains the best-known platform for digital comics, Madefire is trying to do something a bit different. Instead of just bringing print comics to digital formats with minimal changes, it adds animation, sound effects and music to the mix.
The company describes the resulting product as a motion book — not exactly the same thing as the motion comics that publishers have experimented with in the past. Wolstenholme emphasized that despite the multimedia bells and whistles, Madefire’s motion books should still be an active reading experience, not a passive viewing one, the key distinction being that the text isn’t just replaced with voiceover.

Madefire started out by publishing its own titles (including Wolstenholme’s own book, Mono), but it’s now working with well-known comics publishers like DC, IDW and Kodansha — Wolstenholme said it’s on track to have more than 40,000 books in the store by the end of the year. Madefire also launched a product called the Motion Book Publisher, allowing comics publishers to create their own storefronts and apps, and it’s even worked with Apple to create a comic book explaining the new App Store review guidelines.
Wolstenholme added that the broader goal is to create a “native digital experience,” whether that’s on phones, tablets or internet-connected TVs. In fact, the new money is intended, in part, to fund an expansion into virtual reality and augmented reality, although Wolstenholme said it’s too soon to offer any details.",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/madefire.jpg?w=738,"digital-comics,madefire","Madefire, a digital comics startup with an eye on virtual reality, raises $6.5M"
247,Sarah Perez,"There are a number of ways to save links from the web for later access, whether that’s marking articles to read later via apps like Instapaper or Pocket, pinning shopping inspiration to Pinterest, creating playlists on YouTube or even just using a browser’s bookmarking feature. But a new app called Stash, available for both iOS and Android, wants to offer a better link-saving service by making it easier to save, organize, search and share any content you find and want to keep.
Unlike a simple bookmark manager, like those built into some web browsers, Stash has developed technology that will automatically categorize your links based on the type of content they include. That means instead of just saving articles to read later, for example, Stash can organize a range of items into their own categories, like places, books, recipes, files, movies, songs, videos, products and more.

Stash also addresses other issues with some rival bookmarking services — moving content between devices and actually remembering to revisit the items you’ve saved at a later time. With Stash’s “push to device” feature, you can quickly send an article you’ve saved on the web to your smartphone, to your tablet or vice versa.
Meanwhile, by enabling notifications, you can also choose to set alerts on individual items so that you’ll make time to return to them later.
For instance, you could alert yourself on Sunday morning to read that long, multi-page feature article you didn’t have time for during the week. This is something that fans of “read it later”-style services will likely appreciate, as we all too often save web content for later perusal, but then promptly forget about it.

The app itself is fairly simple to use, though it does have to walk you through a few steps during setup, like enabling access in iOS’s share sheet for use in your mobile applications, enabling notifications in the web browser via its Chrome extension or adding other devices to your account.
Once set up, you can also search your saves in Stash using filters or share them with others via an “Inbox” feature, in addition to saving and sharing.
Stash was developed by Cornell students Rahul Shah (CEO), Chris Goes (CTO) and Sachin Rudraraju (CPO) following a pivot from their earlier attempt at building analytics software for media publications called Speare. The classification technology they developed for Speare now powers Stash in order to automatically categorize and tag the web pages users save. That tech gets better over time, as more people use Stash, and correct its data.
“We built Stash with the idea that there’s a lot of content on the web that we want to save, but current save-for-later services focus mainly on articles. There are also the songs we find on Soundcloud, the places we want to eat at on Yelp, the books we want to read on Goodreads — just to name a few,” explains Shah. “We wanted to build one place to store all of that information, while effortlessly keeping it organized,” he says.
Of course, there have been a number of attempts at reinventing bookmarking over the years since the fall of top social bookmarking services like Delicious. Five years ago, for instance, a TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield finalist, Spool, debuted its “Instapaper on steroids,” which let you save any content to its app, including not only text, but also media like audio and video. (Spool was later acqui-hired by Facebook). Facebook since launched its own “read it later” feature, with the launch of its Save button.
Other apps like Kippt, Pinboard, Pearltrees, Clipix and more have also tackled bookmarking from various angles, while niche services have focused on verticals, like location, as with Soon, Grafetee, Mapstr and Matchbook, to name a few.
None has ever had the breakout success that Delicious once had during the Web 2.0 heyday, which raises the question as to whether universal, smart bookmarking tools are in huge demand among today’s consumers.
Stash is available as a free download and isn’t yet generating revenue. The company is backed by $20,000 in seed funding from Dorm Room Fund, as well as friends and family contributions.

248,John Mannes,"Chicken, peas, beef, sweet potatoes and blueberries, the stuff of $40 meals in places like Hayes Valley and Greenwich Village — and starting today, also the stuff of dog food.
Ollie, a new startup founded by Alex Douzet, Gabby Slome and Randy Jimenez, is aimed squarely at disrupting the premium pet food space by offering something like a Sprig or Maple for dogs. With a new $4.4 million round co-led by Primary Ventures and Lerer Hippeau Ventures, with participation from Canaan Partners, and others, Ollie hopes to deliver customized, healthy and natural meals to dog owners across the country.
Just like with humans, eating the right food is critical for the health and well-being of dogs. Alarming statistics are not hard to find that depict the rise of diabetes, cancer and liver failure in pets.
To combat this, the Ollie team is using real ingredients to produce food for dogs that is fit for human consumption. The company is also using online profiles to manage nutritional needs to moderate portion sizes.
“We understand the dog,” said Douzet. “We capture information like breed, activity label, if dog is spayed/neutered, and based on that we have an algorithm that will calculate daily calorie needs and match that to the food type that we send.”
With this information in hand, the company ships portioned meals in two-week intervals to dog owners. The online profile for each dog can be updated at any time, so if your dog gains or looses weight, recalculation of dietary needs can be done easily.
At any given time, the Ollie team is split between New York and Pennsylvania. The company uses a third-party USDA kitchen in the Keystone State to produce its meals and keeps people on the ground at all times to ensure quality.
The on-demand model has become a bit trite in recent years, but there is a biological basis to justify it in the case of Ollie. Because the company ships new meals every two weeks, it doesn’t have to add preservatives to keep the food from spoiling.
Ollie is proud of the fact that their food is so nutritious they only have to add a small number of supplements to meet the AAFCO basel requirements. It’s important to remember that some dogs may still be in need of a boost in a specific area if they have a particular condition or predisposition. Veterinarian Dr. Craig Etherington underscores this point. “You can have great ingredients but not have a balanced diet.”
In the human world, the speculation about a tech bubble seems to be in temporary remission, but in the dog world — business is booming. The premium dog food market has grown to become a $13 billion market, and shows no signs of stopping. Double-digit growth has attracted a slew of startups for dogs, but very few have achieved the scale that would signal a mature, saturated, market. This is the case with PetPlate, one of Ollie’s closest competitors. The two companies are taking slightly different approaches to cornering the market. PetPlate is starting with a few more menu items than Ollie, but delivery is constrained to the northeast.
“Ollie started with the mindset of being national from the get-go,” said Ben Sun, partner at Primary Ventures. “Some other businesses launch locally first on the delivery aspect which is interesting, but it’s hard to scale that across the country.”

Right now, you can get Ollie in all 48 states of the continental United States via FedEx delivery. Prices start at $3 per pound and average around $6 per pound, depending on the needs of your particular dog. That price is certainly more than non-premium offerings from other manufacturers, but doesn’t come close to topping the prices of some premium freeze-dried options that can exceed $15 per pound.
Ollie is getting off the ground with two products, a chicken and a beef version of its dog food. In the future, the team wants cats to have access to quality food, as well. Randy, the only cat owner on the team, is spearheading the effort that should bring peace and order back to the pet world.",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/olliefounders_02.jpg?w=738,"dogs,ollie",Ollie raises $4.4M to become the Sprig of dog food
249,Lora Kolodny,"Fenox Venture Capital has put plans for its India-focused fund on hold after a recently appointed general partner who was hired to lead that fund, Venktesh Shukla, hastily departed the firm.
TechCrunch reached out to Shukla and Fenox partners for information about the abrupt change to its senior investing team.
Shukla did not offer much detail, but in an email to TechCrunch said, “I was initially tempted by the opportunity to work with the fund in India but changed my mind. [I’ve] decided to build my own early-stage fund focused on Silicon Valley innovation.” The investor left Fenox in April, the same month that he was hired.
Shukla’s early-stage fund is called Monta Vista Capital.
In addition to his investing activities, Shukla is the chairman of the nonprofit TiE Global and president of TiE Silicon Valley, organizations that advocate “wealth creation through entrepreneurship,” and provide mentorship, education and networking for dues-paying members.
Fenox Venture Capital’s General Partner and CEO Anis Uzzaman said the firm had begun to raise a new, $40 million to $60 million fund to invest in companies based in India, recognizing the burgeoning market in the region, and an opportunity to have a portion of funds invested there matched by the Indian government.
Uzzaman says Fenox had LPs’ expressed interest in creating this fund, but had not finalized capital commitments or called any capital in April when it hired Shukla as a general partner.
Fenox considers Shukla a “great friend of the firm,” the CEO said, and will aim to co-invest in deals alongside his fund in the future.
Uzzaman chalked up Shukla’s departure from Fenox to a time-management concern. Once things got rolling, Uzzaman said that Shukla and Fenox partners realized he wouldn’t have enough time to fulfill his duties at TiE Global and Monta Vista as well as at their firm.
Fenox aims to recruit or promote another partner to lead its India fund, and expects that fund to close next year, he said.
Founded in 2011, Fenox raises its funds from corporate limited partners only, including its anchor, the automotive components company Fenox Corporation. Among its newer limited partners, Fenox VC lists corporations such as Bandai Namco and Infocom.
The firm does not invest on behalf of wealthy individuals, family offices or endowments. Its portfolio tends to focus on consumer hardware, apps and services and emerging technologies, especially in robotics and artificial intelligence.
To put Fenox’s delayed fund in perspective, venture investors have been talking for years about the potential, but serious risks, of investing in India.
Last month, Social Capital founder and investor Chamath Palihapitya, whose firm intends to invest $1 billion in India-based tech companies, recently told the India Business Times that the region needs “a massive expansion of its middle class,” before startups, and venture investors, can really succeed there.
Investors poured $9 billion into startups in India-based startups in 2015 according to estimates from YourStory.
Venture Intelligence, a provider of private company financial data, reported that 16 venture funded startups in India shut down in 2015. That trend has continued into 2016 at an even more rapid pace. And investments in India have seemingly slowed down over the first three quarters of 2016.
The investment world is watching India to see if startups there that have raised massive rounds of venture capital at high valuations, including Flipkart, Snapdeal, Ola, Housing.com and others, will bring investors great returns.
Update: This post was updated to clarify that Shukla departed Fenox rather quickly after he joined, in April. ",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/india-cash.jpg?w=738,"tie-global,anis-uzzaman,fenox-venture-capital",Fenox Venture Capital puts India fund on hold after General Partner Venktesh Shukla departs

A new app officially launching today, Hiro Baby, wants to make this transition to parenthood less stressful by offering personalized, timely updates on baby’s development, along with ways to get expert advice, product recommendations and other support.
The app is basically a personal assistant for parents. You start by entering your child’s information — their age, or even your stage in pregnancy, if you’re being proactive. As you move through your pregnancy, up through the first 12 months of baby’s life, Hiro Baby will alert you to upcoming milestones and offer context.
For example, the app may alert you that your baby will probably start crawling within a few weeks, so now is a good time to start childproofing the home.

There are so many milestones during this first year, and many new parents don’t know when these small changes will arrive. This includes things like when the child will begin to mimic your sounds, lift their head, roll over, focus on faces, sit up and more. Parents also often don’t know when to be concerned if the child hasn’t reached one of these milestones — that’s where the expert advice comes in.
“Until Winter 2015, our team was focused on developing an app that served a completely
different industry. Then, two of our team members became new parents, and due to the
mounting pressures of balancing parenting and working, they ended up quitting. This opened our eyes to the struggles of modern parents,” explains Hiro Baby’s co-founder and CEO Phillip Buckendorf, as to why the team decided to launch this product. (The company previously was working on an order-ahead app called Downtown.)

In addition to offering this general information, you can tell the app what you need help with, by speaking or typing. You can ask questions about behavior or even which stroller to buy, and Hiro Baby will respond.
Human experts work in combination with AI technology to provide answers, the co-founder says. The app leverages a neural network (LSTM – Long Short Term Memory) and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) to suggest responses to user requests. Then human agents approve or reject the suggestions, which, in turn, improves the AI by training it with more data, Buckendorf adds.
The information these experts provide is based on vetted information Hiro Baby sources from academic articles, pediatricians, nutritionists and respected parenting websites. Plus, most experts are parents themselves.
Along with providing responses to questions about baby and parenting, the app can also recommend products, like toys, bibs, cradles, car seats, teething aids and more. And you can use Hiro Baby to actually order those products, too, which are fulfilled through large retailers like Amazon and Giggle, as well as smaller mom-and-pop shops.
Today there are 4 million babies born in the U.S. per year, with parents spending $12,000 during the first year of the baby’s life — but while Hiro Baby could tap into this spending as its primary business model, it primarily focuses on its subscription offering instead.
Hiro Baby makes money through its premium service. While the free app will send you the proactive alerts and reminders, the $20 per month paid tier is what allows you to connect with the experts, receive recommendations and get help your with orders.
The app was previously available to a smaller group for testing purposes, but is today officially launching to the wider public.
The startup, meanwhile, has raised a total of $1.8 million in funding, but this includes investment raised for its prior app.

251,Haje Jan Kamps,"It’s been just over a year since Adobe launched its Adobe Stock photography service, with deep integration into the company’s Creative Cloud suite. Today, it expands the number of photos available with the EyeEm Collection, a hand-picked selection of the best images EyeEm‘s customers have shared and offered for sale on the platform.
That’s good news for people buying images via Creative Cloud, good news for people selling images on EyeEm and great news for EyeEm itself, adding another revenue stream to the existing sales channels to Getty.

Adobe’s Stock collection already included 55 million photos, videos, illustrations and graphics before it started pulling content from EyeEm’s sizable stack of creative stock photography. EyeEm’s collection is sourced from a large number of photographers, often shooting with smartphones. The company says it has more than 80 million images from more than 18 million photographers in its catalog.
“Photographers often don’t even know the value of the images that are sitting on their camera roll on their phone,” Meissner told me earlier this year, around the time when the brand started flexing its computer vision muscles with its launch of The Roll. “The truth is that you don’t have to be a professional photographer to take amazing photos, we are seeing amateur photographers who have never made money from their images in the past doing great on the EyeEm Marketplace!”",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/eyeem-homepage-screenshot-ii.png?w=738,"photography,adobe,eyeem",Adobe teams up with EyeEm to expand its stock photography portfolio
252,Steve O'Hear,"Hooks, the app that enables you to get a push notification for things that are important to you — such as news, new film releases or just about anything — has updated its iOS app to make it social by adding live chat to each notification.
“Now anyone who gets the same notification can talk inside Hooks app,” Hooks co-founder and COO Oleg Kozynenko tells me. “We’ve been testing this for the last month and we are getting very good participation numbers.”
So far, so nifty. But why add chat to an app that is otherwise all about private custom notifications? Kozynenko says that with 3 million-plus subscriptions to Hooks topics, the startup is already seeing users clustering around the same interests.
“What’s more important [is] we have their attention at the exact same moment something happens… when they receive a push notification about something they love,” he adds.
This, of course, presents some obvious social moments, such as when your football team scores or a new episode of your favorite TV show airs. Or when I publish my latest article on TechCrunch (I wish!).
It’s also a feature made ever more enticing by not only its immediacy but the way the Hooks UI surfaces how many other people have just received the same notification and are therefore also candidates to join the conversation.
Meanwhile, I’m told that Hooks has raised further funding: a $750,000 round backed by Techstars, KFund, Lanzame, Bankinter and various unnamed angels.",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/unnamed.png?w=738,hooks,Hooks adds chat feature to let you converse around the same push notification
253,"Josh Constine,Katie Roof","Twitter once tried to buy Shots for $150 million to score its 3 million rabid teen users, a source tells TechCrunch. But the Justin Bieber-funded selfie app developer dreamed of a different destiny, where it would become the “Saturday Night Live” of the mobile generation.
The Shots app grew to a peak of almost 8 million users, but ultimately it was too difficult to compete with Instagram and Snapchat. Despite a shift to comedy and acquisitions like lo-fi video capture app Camcorder and music video maker Mindie, the Shots team decided they were better off as a content creator.
Social media stars from Vine, Instagram and Snapchat befriended the startup. The Bieber affiliation gave it credibility, and co-founder John Shahidi’s “I’m on the creator’s side” stance fostered trust with multi-million view video makers like Lele Pons and Rudy Mancuso. Shahidi discovered that as long as these web celebs kept pumping out funny skits, their fans would follow them from one social media platform to the next.

So over the past few months, Shots has rebranded as Shots Studios, and turned its focus from apps to the content people share on them. It’s taken stars who built their fame in still Instagrams, 6-second Vines and off-the-cuff Snapchat clips, and helped them shoot high-production four-minute YouTube videos.
The result? Millions of views per video, strong ad revenue and, according to a source close to the company, sudden partnership interest from Facebook, Netflix and Verizon that could potentially spill into acquisition talks.

All except Bach have exclusive deals with Shots which takes a revenue cut of their earnings that John Shahidi wouldn’t specify but that he called “creator friendly”. In exchange, creators get access to a production team including a film crew, writers, and editors; brand management; sales help; and access to Shots’ data and growth teams.
While the startup declined to comment on specific discussions, Shots Studios insists that they are not focused on selling the company right now. Their new business model has been building momentum and the company is a few months away from profitability, due to ads and partnerships with Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and American Express. Shots will still run its app, but the team is concentrating on video production and distribution.
Content creation has become a growing business, with mobile video consumption skyrocketing in the past few years thanks to better cameras, screens and wireless networks. Advertisers are looking to reach these viewers, particularly in the young demographic that Shots caters to, and video ads pay much more than their annoying banner cousins.
If executed correctly, Shots’ plan could ultimately lead to a big exit for the company. Maker Studios was acquired by Disney for more than $500 million. Fullscreen also found a lucrative outcome. 

Anything at or above that original $150 million price Twitter dangled would be a big win for Shots’ investors. It has raised $15 million in funding; investors include 500 Startups, Floyd Mayweather and Major League Baseball. And Shots’ most famous investor, Justin Bieber, is more involved than ever. The star got his own start on YouTube and we’re told that he’s very enthusiastic about helping the next generation of artists.
And that concept of creating as a team could be Shots’ greatest strength. Each of its affiliated stars do cameos in each others’ videos and cross-promote them to their own fans. That strategy let the Shots family of stars become the oligarchy ruling Vine’s Popular page. Now the startup will give them the spotlight for a lot longer than six seconds.",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/lele.png?w=738,"shots,justin-bieber,vine",Shots Studios rebrands from selfie app to social star video factory
254,Natasha Lomas,"The startup behind a fun, augmented reality tattoo app called InkHunter, covered by TC back in April, is launching its Android app out of beta today — after racking up some 2.5 million downloads on iOS.
They’ve been beta testing on Android, as they worked to ensure their AR tech could handle a range of hardware and slower Android devices, but are launching officially now.
The team is also fleshing out its evolving business model, having spent the summer in the ERA accelerator in New York, relocating to the U.S. from Ukraine.
Their app idea started life as a project cooked up during a 48-hour hackathon back in mid-2014, but the startup is now looking to move beyond being just an app for virtually trying tattoos — eyeing a B2B play, with a plan to license their core augmented reality technology to e-commerce and gaming app makers.
So instead of focusing on building a marketplace for tattoo artists, they’re now working on an SDK for other developers with a particular need for AR-powered product visualization within their own apps and services.
The team intends to continue developing their InkHunter consumer tattoo app, though mostly as a showcase of the AR tech. CEO Oleksandra Rohachova also says they are looking to work with brands to develop branded tattoo campaigns within the app — mostly for “social sharing” potential more than encouraging people to seriously get a company logo inked on their person (although of course people do… ).
“We are going to launch a few campaigns at the end of the year,” she tells TechCrunch.
When it comes to their plan for licensing via an SDK, they’re hoping to have launched to all comers in about a year’s time, after first running trials with select partners — and are aiming to start that this year.
Examples of the sorts of licensing use-cases that could make sense for pen-and-ink-powered virtual try-ons are accessories such as watches and jewelry, reckons CTO Pavlo Razumovskyi. InkHunter’s AR requires users ink three straight lines on themselves where they want to virtually try something — such as a tattoo — which its algorithms use to anchor the result and scale it correctly.
Another possible use-case Razumovskyi mentions is visualizing large items of furniture or electronics in a room. For this scenario, instead of the user drawing on their skin to anchor the AR correctly, he suggests they could use sticky notes positioned in the correct spot in the room where they want a new sofa/TV/table, etc.
“Right now if you want to try an augmented reality in your app… there are two approaches. The first one is basically some printed marker — so you need to print something, or buy something, or get something which the app can recognize. Which makes it almost impossible to spread to a lot of people,” he argues. “I don’t know any successful B2C example of AR based on some printed stuff.
“There are also technologies that don’t use any kind of marker. Pokémon Go uses it. But they’re prone to moving around and are not really stable. So when we developed the tattoo app we figured out how to make stable, not shaky AR — with the ability to spread among users. And our secret sauce is these three lines.
“These markers that people can draw with any kind of pen… On any surface. And in different shapes and the app still recognize that. And can give a stable picture of the end — like tattoos.”
So there you have it: A tech startup that reckons its secret sauce is old-school pen and ink… Who said paper was dead?

The team has just graduated ERA’s demo day and Rohachova says it’s planning to stay in NY, while keeping some of its devs back in Ukraine for costs reasons. At this point they’ve taken in $40,000 in funding from ERA, via its accelerator program, but plan to start raising a seed this year.",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-05-at-11-46-29-am.png?w=738,"ar,inkhunter,augmented-reality","InkHunter’s AR tattoo app exits beta on Android as startup looks to wider, B2B play"
255,Sarah Perez,"Yahoo’s homepage used to be the place where web users started their day, reading the top headlines, sports scores, stock updates, and other news. On mobile, that’s no longer always the case. In an effort to get back into the game, Yahoo this morning is launching a rebranded version of its flagship application, now called Yahoo Newsroom.
The goal with the new app is to compete with the many sources where people get their news today – ranging from standalone apps like Apple News to social media sites like Facebook.
Disclosure: TechCrunch parent company AOL is owned by Verizon. Verizon has agreed to acquire Yahoo. 
Similar to Apple News and some other aggregators, Yahoo Newsroom aims to offer a personalized experience. In the “Explore” section, you can browse through a series of topics, like “U.S. News,” “Politics,” “Finance,” “Lifestyle,” “Celebrity,” “Sports,” and more, then select those that are of interest to you. In the app, these topics – for whatever reason – are called “Vibes.”
As you continue to use the app, read and interact with the stories, the news it displays will become more tailored to your interests over time, says Yahoo.
What’s different about Yahoo Newsroom is that it’s not just a collection of Yahoo News’ own content – it encourages users to actively participate, as well, by posting articles from around the web into a “Vibes” section in order to spark discussions.
This sounds like the potential for trouble – in addition to having to keep out spam and other malicious content, it seems likely that people will share news from less-than reputable sources – there’s now a plethora of “fake” news sites out there thanks to social media, and even Facebook’s algorithms have been duped by them before – like when Facebook’s trending section promoted a 9/11 “truther” story, for example. It should be interesting to see how well Yahoo’s tech holds up against this crowdsourced news-gathering.
Yahoo is positioning the app as a better alternative to Facebook, because it frees you to “speak your mind,” away from social pressure, and allows you to “engage in open discussions.” I hate to tell Yahoo this, but it doesn’t appear that people have too many qualms about posting their opinions – however terrible they may be – directly on Facebook.
Yahoo Newsroom is live now on iOS and Android.

256,Matthew Lynley,"While at LinkedIn, Steve Goodman and his co-founders spent a lot of their time trying to help companies dig up the best possible candidates from those that exist around the Web — but might not have applied.
But after candidates have applied, their resumes are sitting in a database somewhere on a company’s servers. And they continue to sit there, likely untouched or only lightly searched, even as companies continue to scour for new potential candidates for roles they need to fill. While those candidates might not have been in the right place at the right time, they might now be the right people to hire.
Restless Bandit, a new company from Goodman and his co-founders, is looking to give companies a way to easily find the best candidates that have already applied, rather than companies having to sift through those existing resumé piles with keywords and the like. Taking a similar approach to how LinkedIn scoured the Internet (and LinkedIn, of course) for new candidates, Restless Bandit finds the highest-potential candidates for roles with statistical modeling. The company said it has raised $8 million in a financing round from GGV Capital and Toba Capital, and it previously raised $2 million in a seed funding round.
“We’re taking a resume, we’re building a statistical model around that resume, abstracting it out and the same for the job descriptions,” Goodman said. “What that gives you is the opportunity that good people don’t fall through the cracks.”
Restless Bandit is essentially trying to draw correlations between a specific candidate and a set of more generalized candidate spaces that might suit specific roles that an employer is looking for. The higher the probability that a candidate fits a certain set of qualifications — as well as the job that recruiters are trying to fill also hitting those same qualifications — the higher they are likely to get surfaced in those results.
Part of the problem is drawing correlations between skill sets in order to find the right position. A recruiter might be looking into old resumes trying to find someone with expertise using Marketo, though if they have expertise using Hubspot those skills might be easily transferable and make those candidates also valuable, Goodman said. Restless Bandit also makes sure that the gaps between an existing resume and the information about that candidate that’s available on the web is also updated, Goodman says, so the company has a continuous profile of that candidate.
Goodman sold his previous company, Bright, to LinkedIn for around $130 million. But while LinkedIn was largely focused on finding new candidates that might not have already applied to those companies, Goodman said he saw an opportunity in doing something that was a little perpendicular in sifting through massive resume piles that already exist. Those piles can even range in the tens, to hundreds of thousands, or even millions for larger enterprises like Coca-Cola.
At the moment, there’s another issue for recruiters as well: candidates that stuff their resumes with keywords in order to get picked up by those search engines. As a result, resumes that are keyword-heavy may end up surfacing higher than candidates that may actually be more qualified, while Restless Bandit looks to try to draw correlations between strong candidates and excise those sorts of problems.
Taking an algorithmic approach, too, can help companies try to excise as much bias as they can throughout the process — because they’re centered around a data-centric approach rather than a simple gut check that might be impacted by an unconscious bias. Though, the algorithms have to be carefully tuned so as to not themselves create weird quirks or biases in the process. That’s always going to be a challenge, and it’s up to the company to ensure that it from running into some kind of endless loop that doesn’t actually achieve what it wants to achieve.
“One thing our algorithm started to notice in working with pharmaceutical companies, [for sales representatives it] started to pick up Smith College, an all women’s college in the northeast, it started to go crazy only surfacing people from Smith College,” Goodman said. “It’s an example where the algorithm can go so far that it becomes discriminatory in the other direction. We had to actually go back and rethink the way we get at those types of algorithms spinning out of control.”
While Goodman says there are no exact direct competitors, there are of course variations — but the larger looming threat is the possibility that Google or Facebook, with their own approaches to doing these kinds of things, could end up open sourcing what they use. That, and keyword search tools for resumes could become increasingly sophisticated, or those tools may also branch into a more algorithmic approach.
In the end, Restless Bandit will have to end up in the hands of job-seekers in some fashion, though Goodman said he isn’t quite sure what that looks like just yet. For now, the company is focusing on large enterprises — ones that generally have more than 1,000 employees — but it’s still going to require the right resumes going to the right spots in the first place, even if they aren’t the right fit at the right time.
“We’re thinking about it from the company perspective, but ultimately where this has to go is the candidate,” Goodman said. “This tech has to get to the candidate to help them weed through where their true opportunities are and where they aren’t and they’re chasing their tail.”",2016-10-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/hrtech-screenshot-01.jpg?w=738,"job-hunting,resumes",Restless Bandit raises $8M to help companies dig through their old resume piles
257,Josh Constine,"Every member of the Facebook family of apps is pushing to bring copies of Snapchat’s best features to international audiences before Snapchat blows up abroad. There was the Facebook Camera Feed, Instagram Stories and Messenger Day — and now WhatsApp is cloning Snapchat’s creative tools.
Now you’ll be able to add overlaid text with multiple colors and fonts, drawings and emojis to photos and videos you shoot or upload with WhatsApp. These allow for better visual communication, where you can add captions, highlight certain things, jazz up scenes with silly doodles or augment them with emoji. Snapchat popularized this style of chat, which can feel more fun, inspired and vivid than messaging with just text or unadorned images.
WhatsApp has also grabbed Snapchat’s front-facing flash feature for illuminating your face by blinking your screen white, which lets you take low-light selfies. Meanwhile, you can zoom in before taking a photo or while shooting a video by dragging a single finger up and down the screen, which allows one-handed zooming.
In the U.S., this move might come off as blatant stealing of features that have become synonymous with Snapchat. Snapchat has 150 million daily users, with 60 million of them in the U.S. and Canada.
But WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly users scattered all over the developing markets of the world. Many of those countries don’t see much Snapchat adoption, so these people might not associate these creative tools with Snapchat. Instead, they might simply see this update as a big improvement to WhatsApp.
The international messaging juggernaut doesn’t have all the nifty features of Snapchat, like animated selfie lenses, geofilters or augmented reality 3D stickers. But if it can offer decent creative tools for visual communication, WhatsApp’s users might have less reason to stray to Snapchat if the ephemeral app eventually becomes popular in their area.
Good-enough features plus being the first app to offer them at scale in a market could succeed better than having the best features but showing up late.",2016-10-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/whatsapp.png?w=738,,WhatsApp races to internationalize Snapchat’s overlaid creative tools
258,Natasha Lomas,"Alphabet (née Google) has been given yet another extension to file its respond to charges in Europe that it has misused the dominance of its Android mobile platform to lock out competition by promoting its own services over and above others.
Reuters reported the extension today, which gives the company until the last day of this month to file its rebuttal, and follows another extension last month — at the time touted as Google’s last — which pushed the deadline from September 7 to September 20. The original EC deadline for Google’s response was in April so we’re heading for six months later already at this stage (meanwhile the EC’s initial probe of Android complaints dates back to April 2015).
That said, it is common for competition investigations to involve extensions, although — from the complainant point of view — the risk is of the issue being kicked so far into the long glass that any corrective measures come too late.
In the case of the Android antitrust probe, which has focused on complaints that Google uses the OS as a ‘trojan horse’ to embed its own apps and services into smartphone devices at the expense of rivals’, there’s a very real risk of a substantially negative outcome for Google’s business in Europe. Alphabet could face a fine of up to 10 per cent of its annual turnover — which is close to $75BN — if the EC antitrust charges are upheld against it.
At the weekend Reuters reported the EC is preparing to fine the company in the Android probe — citing a charge sheet it had seen, although it did not provide details of the size of the impending fine.
The charge sheet also apparently includes an EC instruction to Google to cease making payments to smartphone makers as an incentive to pre-install its apps.
A spokesperson for the antitrust department declined to comment on those claims but did confirm the latest extensions to the deadlines — which not only cover the Android antitrust investigation but also two other ongoing EC probes of Alphabet/Google services: namely its price comparison service Google Shopping and its AdSense business.
Google now has until October 13 to send the EC its response to the Google Shopping charges, and October 26 to file its response to AdSense.
“In each of these cases, Google asked for additional time to review the documents in the case file. In line with normal practice, the commission analysed the reasons for the request and granted an extension allowing Google to fully exercise its rights of defence,” said Commission spokesperson Ricardo Cardoso in a statement.
There have now been four deadline extensions in all in the Android antitrust investigation, and one apiece for AdSense and Shopping.
The fact Google is having to respond to three investigations simultaneously is likely working in its favor when it comes to obtaining extensions.
The current deadlines in each case means the time for Google to reply, i.e. from the moment the EC issued a formal statement of objections, currently stands at 13 weeks for Shopping; 15 weeks for AdSense; and 27 weeks for Android — although of course there may yet be further extensions.
Reuters also suggested the EC might fine Google in the Shopping probe, citing another charge sheet it has seen. According to its report it’s also possible Google may also be asked to rank rival comparison shopping services in the same way as its own services — with the EC reportedly set to decide later whether it would allow Google to charge competitors for displaying their services prominently.
But again, there’s no official confirmation from the EC at this stage.
Google also recently lost an appeal in the Russian courts over a similar complaint relating to how it operates its Android OS in that market — including how it bundles its apps with the Google Play store; requirements that its OEMs preinstall its Google search engine by default; and give its app icons preferential placement on the first screen of handsets.
Over the summer Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) agency imposed a fine of 438M RUB (~$6.7M) on the U.S. search giant and ordered it to comply with the original FAS ruling to amend its agreements with OEMs to stop requiring they bundle its services and restricting others apps/services they can choose.",2016-10-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/android-apps.jpg?w=738,"european-competition-commission,smartphones",Google gets more time to respond to EU antitrust charges
259,Sarah Perez,"Typing on small screens can still be challenging, but today’s keyboard apps still focus on text entry over speech, despite the advances in voice-based computing and the increasing accuracy of speech recognition technology. Baidu wants to change that, with a new keyboard app called TalkType that prioritizes voice input over typing. The app was developed by Baidu Research, the Silicon Valley and Beijing-based division of Chinese search company Baidu, and the app will compete with similar third-party keyboards from both Google and Microsoft.
While search apps like Google’s have placed the microphone more prominently in an effort to increase people’s usage of voice input, keyboard apps still generally default to a traditional alphanumeric text input interface.
TalkType is different because it places a large microphone front-and-center in the application. That’s not to say it gives up the keyboard, by any means – naturally, there are still times when it makes more sense to type than talk, but the app’s user interface makes voice the starting point and first option.
“TalkType is the first full-function smartphone keyboard that is ‘voice first,’ not ‘voice also,'” explains Bijit Halder, project leader in Baidu Research’s Silicon Valley AI Lab, in an announcement about the launch. “Unlike conventional smartphone keyboard designs, where voice is targeted for occasional use and delegated to a small mic icon, TalkType is designed to make voice the primary mode,” he says.
Using voice input, you can not only turn your speech into text, you can also use voice commands to add punctuation to your sentences, like “comma,” “period,” “question mark,” and “exclamation point.”
The app also offers word suggestions as you speak. You can select single words or multiple words or sentences, moving either one or two fingers across the app’s trackpad.

 
While the traditional keyboard may be de-emphasized in the new app, it’s not diminished. It supports multiple text entry methods, including swipe.
It also includes emojis and a “QuickShare” feature that lets you more easily send rich media through the app, like GIFs (powered by Giphy) or location information, like restaurants or shops from Yelp, among other things.
You can also share your current location with a friend via the app, and the company says the feature will be expanded with more functionality over time.

QuickShare brings to mind the integrated search and sharing capabilities found in Gboard, Google’s first mobile keyboard application. Similar to TalkType, Gboard lets you pull up restaurants, and other business info, then text it to friends. Integrated GIF sharing is included as well, as is a Google search engine for sharing other news, flight info, weather, and more.
Microsoft also recently rolled out the same feature set to its keyboard, Word Flow.
But both Microsoft and Google’s apps focus on touch-based input – Microsoft with an innovative “wheel” interface for one-handed typing, for example.
Baidu’s TalkType instead starts you with voice, then allows you to navigate between different input methods – like speech, alphabet, symbols, and emoji – via its Quick Action bar. Here, you’ll also find other important buttons, like the return and delete keys.
You can also customize the app using built-in themes.

TalkType was developed by Baidu Research, which is led by Chief Scientist Dr. Andrew Ng. Dr. Ng, a leading machine learning and deep learning expert. Dr. Ng previously co-developed Google Brain, a large-scale deep learning system built on top of Google’s cloud computing infrastructure.
At Baidu since 2014, Dr. Ng has been working on Deep Speech, a deep learning-based speech recognition system. The company says that Deep Speech can be nearly three times faster and even more accurate than typing, citing a recent study from Stanford, University of Washington and Baidu Research. The study pitted Deep Speech’s results against a group of texters ages 19 to 32, who were entering text on their iPhones by hand.
Baidu Research has released other projects, like an AR platform DuSee and AI assistant Duer, but never a keyboard.
With the keyboard, Baidu claims sensitive information like emails and passwords entered via typing never leave the device, but the voice data is sent over a secure connection for transcription, as is a standard practice. This data is never shared, the company says.

By using the international popularity of Messenger to spread the Stories format, Facebook could boost retention and return visits to its chat app while becoming the primary place where people post off-the-cuff lifecasting content before they get hooked on Snapchat.

Sources in Poland spotted Messenger Day and sent TechCrunch’s John Biggs these screenshots. We reached out to Facebook for comment, and it told us “We know that people come to Messenger to share everyday moments with friends and family. In Poland we are running a small test of new ways for people to share those updates visually. We have nothing more to announce at this time.”
Additionally, Facebook says it frequently runs small tests before rolling products out to other regions, but there’s no guarantee it will expand this feature beyond Poland. It’s unclear, but Facebook might not bring it to the US unless it really blows up abroad. 60 million people in the US and Canada already use Snapchat daily, and aggressively pushing Messenger Day there could annoy them. But in countries where people aren’t that familiar with Snapchat, it has nothing to lose by experimenting.
Much of the feature works exactly like Snapchat Stories, with the ability to draw or add text to images. Facebook’s one big innovation with Messenger Day is the use of graphic filters as suggestions for what to share, instead of just to celebrate holidays and events or to show off your location like with Snapchat’s geofilters.

At the top of the Messenger thread list, users see a row of tiles representing “My Day” and friends’ Days they can watch, but there are also prompts like “I’m Feeling”, “Who’s  Up For?” and “I’m Doing”. Tapping on these tiles provides a range of filters “I’m feeling…so blue” with raindrops and a bubbly blue font, “I’m feeling…blessed” with a glorious gold sparkly font, “Who’s up for…road trip” with a cute car zooming past, or “Who’s up for…Let’s grab drinks” with illustrated beer mugs and bottles that cover the screen.
This feature allows people to share visually appealing images even if they aren’t great artists or especially creative. These prompts could also spur usage when people are bored, sparking their imagination.
Messsenger is already an app people use all day with close friends, so it could end up a better home for the Stories format than cramming it into Facebook’s core app, which the company tested as “Quick Updates” and scrapped.
The Stories slideshow format has proven to be a powerful way to share more than the perfectly polished pics people post to Instagram. That’s why Instagram launched its own clone of Snapchat Stories, but its CEO Kevin Systrom admitted “They deserve all the credit”. But Facebook suffers from the same problem of people only sharing their biggest life highlights, which don’t happen that often. Facebook is already so stuffed with features and probably isn’t opened as frequently as Messenger.
Now Messenger Day wants to make this casual sharing option ubiquitous before Snapchat can. That’s a similar strategy to Instagram Stories, which I hear is flourishing in places like Russia where Snapchat adoption is low. This is the benefit of Facebook being a giant company earning $2 billion in profit a quarter. It can clone fast thanks to its enormous team, translate and localize features for testing in certain markets, and cross-promote what works with its inescapable feed and chat apps.
Messenger Day might not lure many people away from Snapchat, but Facebook could stunt its competitor’s growth by racing to to bring its own Stories to the unclaimed corners of the earth.",2016-09-30,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/messenger-snapchat.png?w=738,"snapchat-stories,facebook-messenger",Facebook “Messenger Day” is the chat app’s new Snapchat Stories clone
261,Ingrid Lunden,"Remitly, a startup co-founded and led by a former executive of Barclays who saw a gap in the market to build money transfer and other financial services for emerging markets and the “unbanked”, is today announcing that it has raised $38.5 million, as well as expansion to seven more countries in Latin America. The funding, which brings the total raised by Remitly to just under $100 million, comes just nine months after Remitly raised the same amount in a Series C round, and underscores how the company is trying to seize a moment of growth.
CEO Matt Openheimer describes this latest round as “opportunistic” in part because of the strategic investor it has gained: the International Finance Corporation, a part of the World Bank that arrange finance companies in emerging markets, is backing Remitly, alongside existing investor Silicon Valley Bank, in a round that is a mixture of debt and equity.
“IFC is a clear win for us given their association with the World Bank and its network,” he said. “We hope to leverage [that] to continue to work towards improving trust and transparency around global remittances within our targeted market, developed to developing countries.” Currently the company lets people in the U.S. and Canada send money to Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, India and the Philippines.
Remitly will be using the money to improve its money transfer service, making it faster and cost less for consumers. “Our cash-pick and instant transfer features continue to be very important to our customers, so this extra capital will help us continue to offer these unique services to customers as we grow our global footprint,” Oppenheimer added.
Weak oil prices and other economic declines have recently resulted in the smallest growth in remittances since the global financial crisis of 2007, according to the World Bank. But even so, the market for money transfers in emerging markets continues to grow for developing countries.
In 2015, officially recorded remittances to developing countries totalled $431.6 billion, up 0.4 percent on 2014’s $430 billion. Global remittances — which include money sent to developed markets like the U.S. — actually contracted by 1.7 percent to $581.6 billion in 2015, from $592 billion in 2014.
(Remitly’s remittance estimates appear to be slightly higher for last year, at $600 billion.)
The market is big, but so is the level of competition in it. For starters, there are incumbents like Western Union who dominate the market for money transfers, even if in many cases they are doing so at a higher cost than competitors. Others like WorldRemit and Xoom (owned by PayPal) are also going after the same market, using tech — and in this case, the use of mobile handsets, which are much more ubiquitous in emerging markets compared to computers — to disrupt and overtake some of the older and less efficient ways of doing things.
“Remitly’s mission is perfectly aligned with IFC’s long-standing objective of helping the private sector find solutions that benefit the world’s poor,” said Kai Schmitz, who leads IFC’s Fintech investments in Latin America, said in a statement. “Transfers by migrants to their home countries is a proven way to improve the lives of families and support emerging market economies. The World Bank is actively working with the G20 and other partners to increase choice for senders and lower the cost of remittances. Remitly is a great example how technology can be used to achieve these objectives.”
Oppenheimer said the company is not disclosing its valuation in this round, but as we reported in December, the last round was made at a $170 million valuation, meaning that Remitly is potentially looking at a valuation of around $230 million as of now.
“More important to us than valuation is the consistent growth we continue to achieve in our customer base and transaction amounts and volume,” Oppenheimer told me. Nine months ago, the company passed $1 billion in transaction volume in aggregate, and it’s now on track to push that to $1.5 billion this year. “We’re also north of 2 million transactions made per year, all while we see more than 90% of our customers return to us when they need to send money,” he said.
Other investors that back Seattle-based Remitly include the Stripes Group, DFJ, DN Capital, QED Investors, Trilogy Equity Partners, Bezos Expeditions, Founders’ Co-Op, International Finance Corp., and TomorrowVentures.",2016-09-30,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/dollars.jpg?w=275,"money-transfer,remittances,remitly","Remitly raises another $38M, adds World Bank’s IFC as it pushes into emerging markets"
262,Natasha Lomas,"Security firm Avast has today confirmed the completion of a $1.4 billion acquisition of fellow Czech-based antivirus company AVG. The deal will see Avast’s customer base nearly double — swelling from 230 million to more than 400 million in total, 160M of whom are mobile users.
The acquisition was announced back in July, with scale and geographical breadth touted as the driving forces, along with a plan to expand product offerings including in the Internet of Things space.
Avast says the new combined entity reaches one-third of the world’s PC users outside of China. Both the Avast and AVG brands are likely to continue to operate, depending on relative market strengths.
There will be job cuts, based on eliminating duplicate roles, but Avast is not confirming how many or where they will come at this stage.
The purchase price values AVG at $25 per share, for a total price-tag of $1.3BN, but Avast CEO Vince Steckler said there was also around $100M of AVG debt to pay off — bumping the total paid to $1.4BN.
The acquisition has been completed within the originally slated timeframe.
Speaking to TechCrunch ahead of the deal closing, Steckler said the two companies have been circling each other for decades, given their shared industry and business location. And finally the summer Avast convinced AVG they were better off as one.
“This was, I think, the fourth attempt we have made in the last two or two and a half years to buy AVG,” he said. “We approached them, we got kind of tired of being constantly turned down — so we approached them kind of one last time and told them hey we’ll pay this amount, no higher, no negotiations, tell us yes or no. And they said yes.
“That came together very, very quick — within a matter of days, really.”
But while competitive spirit kept them apart for years — a combination of “pride and arrogance” on both sides, reckons Steckler — larger forces reshaping the computing landscape and the security market are evidently driving them together now. “There’s a better long term future for a combined entity, than two smaller, standalone entities.”
One very big motivator Steckler mentions for the acquisition is machine learning technology now being used to power many security solutions. And AI’s need for data, lots and lots of data.
“Security these days — for the top companies — is very much a big data thing. We’re not into the classic signatures and checksums. These are big data machine learning products, and they rely on having a massive number of end-points to collect data from, to process, to determine what’s good and what isn’t,” he said.
“Getting hold of AVG’s 160M end points, to add to our 240M, it adds a lot more end points into our data analysis — which improves the security results and allows us to stay ahead of others.”
“All the top flight ‘antivirus products’ are all extraordinarily sophisticated, and many of them — such as ours — exist mostly in the cloud. And they run mostly on machine learning and AI,” he added.
The other trend squeezing veteran security players and driving consolidation is of course the decline of traditional AV revenues, especially on the consumer side where free/freemium antivirus products now dominate. The old paid antivirus cash-cow is not what it once was, with PC shipment slowdowns and the shift to mobile computing another factor driving change there.
“The security industry is obviously really maturing, and — at least on the consumer side — the market has heavily shifted to free and freemium,” noted Steckler. “So there’s a pretty rapidly declining marketshare for companies like Norton and McAfee and Kaspersky.”
But he asserted that Avast and AVG have complementary footprints — with AVG doing well in the English-speaking world and Avast in the non-English speaking world — making the pair a good fit to ride out tougher times together.
“The fact that we have such a large geographic spread allows us to ride much better through the market ups and downs,” he said. “For example, the English language markets are hurt a lot more by the slowdown in PC shipments than the non-English markets. But the English markets monetize much better than the non-English markets, so we have kind of complementary strengths and weaknesses.”
Discussing the shift to mobile computing, Steckler said there are a different set of concerns Avast can (and is) addressing here, via mobile products that focus more on privacy and parental concerns than on traditional malware security threats.
“People use their mobile devices for a lot of different things. You’ve got photos on there, some are sensitive, some are embarrassing, you’ve got children who are using phones while they are driving — you’ve got corporations where phones are being used by employees, sometimes for company use. Sometimes for personal use. So the mobile security market is actually pretty big,” he said.
“It’s not the classic AV but there’s lots of other types of security and privacy products. And this is absolutely one of the reasons why we wanted to buy AVG — because AVG have a really good security product that’s not installed on the phones but is installed at the carrier.”
Running security products directly on phones themselves is pretty limiting, he said — given they are just another siloed app and can be disabled by the user. Which makes working with carriers Avast’s preferred route.
“If you install on the carrier infrastructure you’ve got a lot of things now. For example you can implement a family safety product or geofences so that if your child is driving they can’t text message, or if they’re at school they can’t be using the phone. Or you can control how much data they’re using or what they’re really doing on the mobile device,” he added.
“That’s been a very successful business in the US. It’s in the four US carriers and what we want to do is to move that out of the US and frankly that’s going to be the core of a lot of our mobile business.”
Discussing the company’s strategy for the Internet of Things, he noted Avast already has a security product here, focusing on securing IoT devices via the router. Meanwhile AVG was exploring a different strategy — meaning, again, Steckler sees benefits to combining their different efforts.
But at the end of the day he couches IoT as a fairly simply security nut to crack — given most devices connect to the Internet via a router or network gateway.
“I suspect that most of the security for IoT is going to end up at the cloud or at the network level and not really in the device itself,” he said. “If you think about it, why does your Fitbit need to run security software? It doesn’t talk to the Internet, it talks to the router, so you get the router to protect the Fitbit.”
“Very few of the [IoT] things actually directly connect to the Internet. Most everything connects to the router, which connects to the Internet. So… you don’t need to necessarily protect each device because most of the devices are fairly simplistic. What you need to do is protect the devices from being broken into and the easiest point of doing that is at the network or gateway level. Which is where we do it.”",2016-09-30,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/vince-and-threat-labs.jpg?w=738,"avg-technologies,avast-software,software,freeware",Avast CEO on why it’s just spent $1.4BN to absorb security rival AVG
263,Lora Kolodny,"Shazam, the mobile and desktop app that acts as a digital ear and song identifier, crossed the 1 billion download mark recently, according to a report from Billboard on Thursday.
The London-based company, Shazam Entertainment Ltd., also announced that it has achieved profitability, at long last, thanks to a new focus on advertising sales, alongside revenue from commissions on digital music sales and traffic referrals to streaming music sites.
Shazam’s CEO told the Wall Street Journal that the company is still sending 1 million clicks daily to streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music and others who do pay it for the traffic and conversions when they make a purchase. But advertising revenue now is greater for Shazam than other sources.
Ads on Shazam are displayed while app users scan their environment to identify a song or other media like TV shows. The ads on display often have nothing to do with music.
As TechCrunch reported then, Shazam raised $30 million in equity funding early last year at which point the company’s valuation had surpassed $1 billion.
The company has been embarking on partnerships with other app makers and social media platforms in a quest to drive up engagement and keep winning over users.
Competition has increased over the roughly 15 years of Shazam’s existence. Competitors now range from iOS and Android apps like SoundHound and MusixMatch, to audio recognition technology from the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon.
For example, Amazon’s Echo allows users to identify songs that are playing on integrated streaming media services like Spotify by asking questions like “What song is playing?” or “Who is this artist?”",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/06_shazam_iphone_insitu_final.png?w=738,"soundhound,streaming-music,adtech",Shazam is finally profitable after a billion downloads
264,Josh Constine,"SoundCloud as a company is a disaster, but it’s the only streaming service with the DJ sets and remixes kids love. So it makes perfect sense that Spotify is in advanced talks to acquire SoundCloud, the Financial Times reports.
Spotify already declined to buy it twice over the past year and a half; talks broke down over pricing. But since then, SoundCloud has hammered out deals with the major record labels to stop mass take-downs of its content, and its SoundCloud Go $9.99 subscription service flopped. That could make the acquisition less risky and cheaper, sweetening the deal for Spotify.
The negotiations could still fall apart, but if Spotify acquired SoundCloud, it could finally have the weapon it needs to differentiate itself from Apple Music with something Tim Cook can’t just buy.
SoundCloud is the “YouTube of Music.” Creators can upload music and other audio recordings to it directly instead of having to go through a record label or distribution service. That’s helped SoundCloud amass the biggest catalog in streaming: 125 million tracks, compared to around 30 million on Apple Music and Spotify.
But while most music belongs to major record labels with which anyone can strike a streaming deal, what’s on SoundCloud is much more unique. Bedroom demo recordings, multi-hour DJ sets of other people’s dance tracks, unofficial remixes the original artists didn’t authorize.
Some of it is the property of the uploader. Some of it is legally gray or straight-up copyright infringement. Some of it is only allowed because SoundCloud worked with rights management service Dubset to pay the original content creators, a bit like YouTube’s content ID. But users come to SoundCloud because it has what they can’t find anywhere else.

Spotify would surely incur immense legal headaches figuring out how to integrate these tracks if it bought SoundCloud. But liberating this incredible content from SoundCloud’s clunky and sputtering interface and rolling it into Spotify’s polished apps alongside the official music people expect could be a winning combination. Plus, if Spotify wants to diversify its offerings, the podcast and other spoken word content hosted by SoundCloud could broaden its options down the line.
Beyond the content, Spotify might consider firing as much of the SoundCloud team as possible to cut the constant losses endured by the Berlin startup.
No matter what Apple did to pay big performers for early access and exclusives, it wouldn’t have as comprehensive of a catalog as SpotiCloud. If Spotify can make the deal happen without breaking the bank, it might have a better chance of fending off Apple with all its money and platform power.
Luckily, Spotify raised $1 billion in debt financing earlier this year. The investment came with dirty terms that penalize Spotify if it doesn’t IPO successfully, but give it the firepower to make this kind of acquisition. And because Spotify already has its own good-enough radio feature and doesn’t need to buy Pandora, SoundCloud seems like the best use of its war chest.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/spoticloud.png?w=738,"dubset,soundcloud",Spotify could out-dance Apple if it does acquire SoundCloud
265,Anthony Ha,"MightyTV, an app that helps you figure out what to watch next, is now available on Android.
The startup is led by AdMeld co-founder Brian Adams, and it presents users with a stack of movie and TV recommendations which you swipe through, Tinder-style. If you’ve seen something already, you can say whether or not you liked it, which will influence the recommendations you see next. If you haven’t seen something and it seems appealing, you can save it to your watch list.
The app is also connected to streaming services like Netflix and HBO Go, and it can even recommend things that fit in the overlap between your taste and another user’s.
The Android app should look familiar to users of the MightyTV iPhone app, but Adams said it comes with “a few extra bells and whistles,” most notably a word cloud that the company calls your “MQ”, showing users their favorite genres and actors, based on their swiping data.
Adams also told me that the company has rebuilt the machine learning technology that it uses to try to understand the taste of individual users — he described it as a “hybrid” approach that combines genre-based strategies for recommending movies (e.g., if you liked that war movie, you might like this one, too) with “collaborative filtering” based on user ratings.


MightyTV isn’t releasing the total number of users who have downloaded the app since it launched in April, but it sounds like those users are doing a healthy amount of swiping — Adams said 350 is the average number of swipes in the first week. (And keep in mind that recommendations are the point of the app, while swiping is just the way to get there.)
MightyTV recently raised an additional $2 million, bringing its total funding to $4.25 million.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/pr_woman-holding-phone-with-app-android.jpg?w=738,mightytv,MightyTV’s Tinder-style TV recommendation app comes to Android
266,Josh Constine,"Joining celebrity investors like Snoop Dogg, Ashton Kutcher, and Justin Bieber, Queen Bey is bringing her supreme business skills to the tech world. Beyoncé and the management company she started called Parkwood Entertainment have invested $150,000 into Sidestep, an app for buying concert merchandise and skipping the line to pick it up at the show.
Sidestep originally started selling t-shirts and posters for Beyoncé on her Formation World Tour. But after two weeks of seeing its success, Beyoncé and Parkwood invested in Sidestep’s seed round of funding.
Sidestep CEO Eric Jones tells me they “wanted Beyoncé’s tour to be very focused on tech”, and liked the idea of “a tiny scrappy startup doing the biggest tour in the world.”

Beyoncé previously invested in WTRMLN WTR, a watermelon beverage company. She’s believed to have ties to juicing machine maker Juicero, though that company refuses to talk about their relationship. [Update: Beyonce helped start vegan food company 22 Day Nutrition as well.] She’s also a stakeholder in streaming service Tidal thanks to her agreement to give it early access to her music. With her investment in Sidestep, though, she could directly help artists earn more money.
Musicians hoping to get rich off skimpy streaming royalties are kidding themselves. The real money is in using streaming to get famous and then selling concert tickets and merchandise.
But due to long lines and, you know, wanting to actually see the show, many people avoid buying t-shirts and other merch at concerts. That’s where Sidestep steps in.
The startup lets you order tour merchandise before, during, or even after the show from its smartphone app. You can then Sidestep the merch booth line, flash a QR code at the dedicated pickup spot, and grab your items in seconds. Or you can have them delivered to your home. This way you can be sure to get whatever stuff you want in the right size with no fear of wasting time or it selling out.
Along with Beyoncé gear, you can buy merch from artists like Guns N’ Roses, Fall Out Boy, Selena Gomez, and Weezer via Sidestep. The startup gives artists a ton of data about who’s buying, and keeps a 10% service fee charged to the customer.

Sidestep has raised a total of $1.7 million from Beyoncé and other investors including actor Jared Leto, former Lady Gaga manager Troy Carter and Cross Culture Ventures, and the previous CEO of the LA Dodgers. The app has done over $2 million in sales, up 10X from last year. The company competed in TechCrunch’s 1st And Future sports startup hackathon earlier this year. 
Sidestep will have to compete with other merchandise startups like Merchbar, an Amazon-like webstore, and Yoshirt, which lets fans design custom items with a band’s logos and photos. and some people might rather stand in line than pay 10% extra. But with streaming royalties still unable to make up for the drop in album sales, artists will do whatever they can to sell more shirts, and these startups could flourish.
Meanwhile, top performers like Beyoncé who invest will start stackin’ money in Silicon Valley, not just Hollywood.

267,Sarah Perez,"On the fence about whether your child is old enough for their own smartphone? A new app called Luna Launcher can help you warm to the idea, by offering a simple way to limit access to select apps and actions, including who they can call or text – a list you can restrict to family members, for example. Of course, because of the way it needs to interact with your phone’s operating system in order to restrict access, Luna Launcher is only available on Android.
One of Android’s advantages over iPhone is that it permits the use of launchers, which allow you to entirely customize the Android experience, whether that’s access to apps, as with these kid launchers, or just with new themes and layouts. iPhone, on the other hand, requires parents to look down apps and other activities using parental controls.
Today, there are a good handful of kid-friendly launchers for Android smartphones. However, some are focused on littler children or providing access to educational content or games, instead of just being a smart utility.

Luna Launcher, on the other hand, is appropriate for toddlers to preteens, as all it does is lock down access to apps and actions, like who they can call and text. In other words, if you don’t want your 10-year old spending all day texting friends, but want them to have a way to reach mom or dad in an emergency, Luna could be a good fit.
To get started, you create your child’s profile, pick the apps you’ll allow them to use, then choose the shortcuts you want to add, like those to message mom, call dad, etc., by selecting from your contact list. These actions can also including calls and texts from third-party apps like WhatsApp, Skype or Messenger.
When setup is complete, you can further customize the launcher experience by turning on or off the weather, picking a color for your theme, or choosing to disable access to the status bar and notification area.  You can also set daily quotes in Luna, and track usage.

One especially nice feature is the custom YouTube player that’s built-in.
From the settings, you can configure very limited access to YouTube by adding only individual videos to the launcher’s homescreen, playlists, or favorite YouTube channels. This prevents the child from being able to surf across YouTube, where they might encounter more adult content. (You could also add the YouTube Kids app as one of your applications, if you’d rather not take the time to customize access so specifically.)
“The product comes from my real problem,” explains Hoa Le, one of Luna’s two indie developers, based in Vietnam. He says when he bought a new tablet, he decided to hand down his old Nexus 7 tablet to his son since.
“A few months later, I found out that my 5 year-old son spent too much time on the device, mostly playing games. I was struggling to find an app that helps me to set up a kind of ‘parental control’ on the device,” he says.

He and a college friend decided to build Luna as a side project for their own use, which is why the app is currently free.
Unfortunately, during testing, I found that after exiting the parental control screens, Luna would sometimes stop responding to presses. This was only fixed by rebooting the phone. Others don’t seem to have the same issue, so your mileage may vary. Hopefully, it’s a bug that will be addressed in a future update.

268,Lora Kolodny,"A Los Angeles startup called codeSpark has raised $4.1 million in seed funding for web and mobile games that teach kids how to code, even before they know how to read and write effectively.
CodeSpark’s games were developed for kids 4 to 9 years old, and with a goal of not just teaching them STEM concepts, but engaging boys and girls equally well. The games feature characters who are girls, and storylines that do not involve the rescue of girls, for example.
Co-founder and CEO Grant Hosford said the edtech startup’s first game The Foos Coding has been played by 4 million kids in 201 countries to-date. Part of what’s fueled the game’s popularity is that Hosford, and co-founder and Chief Product Officer Joe Shochet, designed its content to be visual not verbal or numeric.
Hosford said, “A no words approach is important to us from an accessibility and localization standpoint. Not only can this be played in China or the U.S., without translation, but if you are a kid with ADHD, dyslexia or some other learning difference or disability, you can play The Foos along with your classmates.”
Kapor Capital led codeSpark’s seed round joined by Idealab, PGA Venture Partners, Felton Group, NewGen Capital, and angel investors including Umang Gupta.
CodeSpark makes its games available for free to public schools, libraries and nonprofits. Individual users, typically parents who want their kids to play the games at home, can buy and download codeSpark games for phones and tablets.
Today, the company launched a premium, subscription service called codeSpark Academy with the Foos, that will deliver constantly refreshing games and content to paying users. The premium service is available for iOS and Android devices.
CodeSpark Academy with the Foos is basically an extended version of The Foos Coding, which includes puzzles and exercises that let kids design, program and share their own games, or “remixes” of games that other kids created using the platform.
Hosford said kids have created 7 million games using “Foos Studio” already.
Idealab founder Bill Gross said he backed codeSpark because of its unique approach to teaching kids programming basics before they develop a high degree of math or reading skills.
“Code will be embedded in everything in our lives if it is not already. We need more people in the U.S. and the world that understand that principle. And that can understand things like what loops, variables and sequences are. That will all matter even if coding is not your occupation,” Gross said.
While Gross today is best-known as the founder of the world’s first startup incubator, Idealab, he earlier started an educational software company called Knowledge Adventure that was acquired by Cendant for $95 million in 1996. So he’s no stranger to the edtech market.
“Back then, I wanted to build software that would help kids fall in love with learning and not just go through these skill-and-drill exercises. Since then, I’ve dreamed of doing that with all the capabilities of the internet, tablets and individualized, adaptive learning,” Gross said.
Hosford said codeSpark will use its seed funding to develop new curriculum, keep building its user base internationally, and test the efficacy of its games by engaging in third party studies with top tier academic researchers.
Down the line, he sees potential for codeSpark to offer curriculum around more than coding basics. Entrepreneurship is an area of interest, he said.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/codespark_kid_playing_mobile.png?w=738,idealab,CodeSpark raises $4.1 million for games that teach kids how to code
269,John Biggs,"Pull on your commenting pants because I’m going to offer up some wild speculation coupled with real-world experience to come to a conclusion that some of you might find ludicrous and others will find just weird. Here we go: I think the Apple Watch’s Mac unlock feature is one of the most compelling things about the watch itself and could turn the smartwatch tides if more manufacturers figure out how to get their wearables to talk to more and more devices.
I rarely wore my Apple Watch until WatchOS 3. I’m a mechanical watch guy so usually I’d strap on something I was testing or one of my other pieces. Now, however, I’m facing a dilemma – do I type in my password on my iMac and my MacBook or do I simply wear my Apple Watch. I’m trending towards the latter and my dumb watches are gathering dust.
The Apple Watch doesn’t do much. It has a few great features and the second edition looks pretty interesting on a sports front but I’ve stopped wearing it to exercise and I can’t really take it with me when I travel so there’s not much call to strap it on in the morning. But, as Danny Meyer discovered, the Apple Watch – and any smartwatch, really – is a great way to consume ambient information. It is also a great way to transmit ambient information like your heart rate, smiley stickers, and, in this case, your password.
Not having to type in my password (which is “IamnotanAppleshill,” by the way) is a small but compelling reason to eschew my dumb watches and folks like Samsung would do well to figure out a way to do the same thing for Windows and Linux. I’d love for my phone to unlock automatically as long as it was, say, a few from my watch. I’d love for my TV to react to my watch, setting up my favorite channels and picking up the media I’ve been consuming. In short, I’d like my watch to be my passport to the digital world. And, because of this one afterthought of a feature, it’s clear that it can be.
A month ago I made a dire prediction: the Swiss watch industry is doomed. I still think this is true. You can say that smartwatches are undignified and ugly and that mechanical watches are better but I would argue that the Blackberry was undignified and ugly but that didn’t stop the rich and famous from tapping away on those ugly blue phones for almost a decade. In this pitiless world utility trumps artistry. Mac unlock is just one thorn in the Swiss watch industry’s side but it is one that cuts deepest because, in the end, it will become the most useful in melding humanity with technology.",2016-10-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/apple-watch-unlock-bmw-1.jpg?w=738,"watch,wearable-devices,apple-inc,computing",The Apple Watch’s unlock feature could turn the smartwatch tides
270,Matt Burns,"Anki is adding large semi-trucks to its Overdrive game. This is clearly an attempt to breathe new life into the platform. And it works. The Supertrucks as they’re called add a new type of game mode and a bit of variety to the race car game.
This is the first major update to Anki’s second generation game. The company launched its first game called Drive in 2013 and followed that up with Overdrive in 2015. The core concept between the two games are the same: Players race small remote control cars around a track using a smartphone app. It’s a slot car game for the smartphone generation. As the players win races and battles, the cars gain new virtual weapons and increase in speed. It’s clever, but for me, the novelty wears off quickly. That’s where Supertrucks come in.
This new type of car is radically different from the race cars. It’s huge, for one. The Supertrucks are three times as large as the race cars. They’re also slower, at first, than the race cars. They lumber around the race track controlled by the game’s AI. Players are supposed to take control of the truck by hitting it with their race car’s virtual weapons. Once a player does enough damage, they get to control the truck and if they control the truck long enough, the truck enters Rage Mode. And in Rage Mode, the truck is nearly as fast as the race cars. Supertrucks are a blast. At least until they’re not.
Eventually the novelty of the big trucks wears off after a few races. My kids love to break out Anki every couple of months. We clear floorspace in their playroom and set it up. The track sections snap together so in theory there are countless ways to make a track, but most of the time, we end up with similar-looking tracks. We race around the track a few times and then the track sits unused for weeks until I pack it up.
For $60 Supertrucks are a fun addition to Overdrive. Is it a must-have add-on? Nah, but they do add new life to the game.",2016-10-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/anki-supertruck-1-of-1.jpg?w=738,anki,Anki Overdrive keeps on truck’n
271,Romain Dillet,"Google is set to announce a bunch of new products tomorrow. And the star of the show is supposed to be the long-rumored Google Pixel. 9to5Google has spotted not one but two accidental leaks that match up and look legit. The Google Pixel will be Google’s flagship Android phone, and here’s what we know so far.
It looks like Google shared some details about the new phones with Canadian telecom company Bell and British retailer Carphone Warehouse. But both companies were a bit too excited about the new devices as they put up pre-order pages with the new phones — these pages have been taken down since then.
The Google Pixel will come in two sizes. The normal version should sport a 5-inch display while the Google Pixel XL should come with a 5.5-inch display. Other than that, the two devices look identical from the outside — it’s still unclear whether the XL will have better specs than the non-XL.
Other specs include a Snapdragon 821 chip, 4GB of RAM, 1080p and 1440 x 2560 displays depending on the size, 32GB or 128GB of internal storage. With 15 minutes of charging, you can expect 7 hours of battery life.
Finally, it looks like Google will make a push for the company’s most recent apps and features. For instance, Google uses the Allo and Duo messaging apps as selling points. We’ll have a team covering the announcement tomorrow. In the meantime, here’s what it looks like (screenshots via 9to5Google):",2016-10-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/pixel-cw-2.png?w=738,"leak,google-pixel,pixel",Here’s what the Google Pixel could look like
272,Sarah Perez,"We’re taking more digital photos than ever, but we’re not very good about printing them out to enjoy them in our homes. Meanwhile, the digital picture frame market has filled with cheap products that haven’t kept up with technology developments, like ubiquitous Wi-Fi, better photo quality, and higher resolutions, in order to instead chase ever-lower price points. Aura aims to pick up where the industry left off, by offering a digital picture frame that’s beautiful enough to be hung on the wall, but also takes advantage of modern technology, like retina displays, mobile apps, facial recognition, gesture control, and sensors.
The end result is a digital picture frame that’s actually not terrible…in fact, it may even be something to lust after.
Aura was founded by Abdur Chowdhury, the Summize founder who became Twitter’s Chief Scientist, and CTO Eric Jensen. It’s the latest product from their company Pushd, which previously had tried its hand at mobile applications.

The co-founders had both had horrible experiences with the digital picture frames they had bought themselves, which prompted the idea for Aura. They realized there was opportunity to innovate in the digital picture frame market, which had not evolved with the times.
“When we looked at the digital picture frame market, we were shocked at what we found,” explains Chowdhury. “It was and is the anti-technology story. 2006 they take off, but in the next decade, the resolution has not changed. Many no longer exist, and those with Wi-Fi are all but gone. It was a market, in my opinion, ahead of its time, in that the technology did not meet the consumer’s expectations,” he says.
With Aura, the team has built an attractive, 8×12 picture frame that comes in two colors, ivory with rose gold trim or black with charcoal trim. The frame is acrylic, is edged in anodized aluminum, and the kit comes with a stand or accessories for wall hanging. Unfortunately, there’s still a power cord, but it’s wrapped in a cloth material to make it less garish.
 
Meanwhile, the screen is basically the same retina display in your iPad (2,048 x 1,536 resolution), which makes pictures look really crisp and clear.
But what makes Aura interesting, also, is its use of technology in terms of interacting with the device and feeding it content. You use the accompanying mobile app to sync an album you create to the device, or you can take advantage of Aura’s facial recognition software to automate the process.
The app will identify the faces in your photos, then you can toggle on a “Smart Select” feature to automate updating the frame with images. The software not only identifies which photos to send, and continues to update as you take more pictures, it also filters out blurry and bad photos – like those with your eyes closed, duplicates, and those that won’t crop well. There’s a nudity filter, too, for privacy’s sake.
Plus, you can invite family members to collaborate on albums, for a more social experience.

In addition, the frame includes sensors that determine if you’re in the room, and then only changes the photos after you’ve left. That way, when you return, you’re always greeted with a new and different experience. And it can sense when you’ve shut off the lights, so it will turn off, too.
Another clever feature is gesture control. That is, you can use “Minority Report”-like swipe gestures at the sensor to move back and forth between your photos. (I was able to test this myself, and it worked fairly well, though there’s a slight lag. It’s something I could see kids having a lot of fun with, however.)

Though the team was not planning on raising funding, when they talked with Spark Capital GP Kevin Thau, he was interested in this idea of a device that’s ambiently aware of you, and trying to display what you love the most. Spark Capital ended up funding a $6 million Series A for Aura, the company announced this week.
“It’s crazy…we spend so much time in our homes and never surround ourselves with all of the wonderful memories we have captured,” writes Thau, in a blog post.
In the future, you’ll be able to daisy-chain together multiple frames to display photos selected through the software, and the company will eventually expand to include more frame sizes and colors.
The current frame costs $399, which makes it less of a competitor to those low-cost rivals bought for the grandparents, and more like something you buy for yourself, for your own home.
“We think about this product less as a gadget – historically, that’s what this category was. We wanted to make a truly beautiful picture frame, that also happens to be very smart,” explains Jonathan Wirt, Aura’s head of marketing, of the price point and target consumer.
Aura is not yet shipping, but the website is now taking sign-ups. Subscribers will be notified when they launch. At that time, orders will be accepted online, and frames will ship in about a week.",2016-09-30,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/aura-lifestyle-1.jpg?w=738,"digital-photos,digital-frame,aura,pushd","Aura rethinks the digital picture frame with smarter software, sensors & gesture control"
273,John Biggs,"In this, the 3000th Year Since The Coming Of The Wanderer (All Praise His Mercy), we are greeted by the fifth Potentate, a Teddy Ruxpin with LCD eyes and iPad connectivity. Teddy Ruxpin, or, as his followers in the Cities of Refuge called him, Ted, is a robotic toy that reads to children and then flays your mind from stem to stern, stealing all hope and blasting your personality to ribbons cast upon a sand-choked hellscape.
There’s not a lot of detail about the new Teddy Ruxpin except that he has the same lovable robotic features and contains 4GB of memory to store stories that he can read to your little ones. Kids can read along with Ted on an iPad and the High Priests of the Withered Tree can bow down before him and make offerings to the Ones Who Came Before. You squeeze his hand to control the stories.
Ted has come in many forms, the first one being that of a 100-foot tall prehistoric Arctotherium angustidens with foot-long teeth that terrorized the ancient Nords for a century before the Warrior-King Olaf destroyed it with fiery scythe. Most recently, however, a small toy company released a model that used cartridges instead of the original tapes. As you’ll recall, Ted’s eyes and mouth were motorized and it was great fun to snuggle up to Ted while he ate your dreams.
You can watch Teddy at the Dallas Toy Show, below. You can also see him in the shadows as he watches you sleep.
As the lady from MommyandGracieShow, below, notes “Toddlers would love to snuggle with Teddy at night while they fall asleep!! Families are going to love this new version that is so faithful to the original!” and, as the Blind Man of the Dead Lands once wrote, “Woe betides he who touches the soft fur of Teddy Ruxpin for within that morass lies madness and decay.”

274,Natasha Lomas,"Security firm Avast has today confirmed the completion of a $1.4 billion acquisition of fellow Czech-based antivirus company AVG. The deal will see Avast’s customer base nearly double — swelling from 230 million to more than 400 million in total, 160M of whom are mobile users.
The acquisition was announced back in July, with scale and geographical breadth touted as the driving forces, along with a plan to expand product offerings including in the Internet of Things space.
Avast says the new combined entity reaches one-third of the world’s PC users outside of China. Both the Avast and AVG brands are likely to continue to operate, depending on relative market strengths.
There will be job cuts, based on eliminating duplicate roles, but Avast is not confirming how many or where they will come at this stage.
The purchase price values AVG at $25 per share, for a total price-tag of $1.3BN, but Avast CEO Vince Steckler said there was also around $100M of AVG debt to pay off — bumping the total paid to $1.4BN.
The acquisition has been completed within the originally slated timeframe.
Speaking to TechCrunch ahead of the deal closing, Steckler said the two companies have been circling each other for decades, given their shared industry and business location. And finally the summer Avast convinced AVG they were better off as one.
“This was, I think, the fourth attempt we have made in the last two or two and a half years to buy AVG,” he said. “We approached them, we got kind of tired of being constantly turned down — so we approached them kind of one last time and told them hey we’ll pay this amount, no higher, no negotiations, tell us yes or no. And they said yes.
“That came together very, very quick — within a matter of days, really.”
But while competitive spirit kept them apart for years — a combination of “pride and arrogance” on both sides, reckons Steckler — larger forces reshaping the computing landscape and the security market are evidently driving them together now. “There’s a better long term future for a combined entity, than two smaller, standalone entities.”
One very big motivator Steckler mentions for the acquisition is machine learning technology now being used to power many security solutions. And AI’s need for data, lots and lots of data.
“Security these days — for the top companies — is very much a big data thing. We’re not into the classic signatures and checksums. These are big data machine learning products, and they rely on having a massive number of end-points to collect data from, to process, to determine what’s good and what isn’t,” he said.
“Getting hold of AVG’s 160M end points, to add to our 240M, it adds a lot more end points into our data analysis — which improves the security results and allows us to stay ahead of others.”
“All the top flight ‘antivirus products’ are all extraordinarily sophisticated, and many of them — such as ours — exist mostly in the cloud. And they run mostly on machine learning and AI,” he added.
The other trend squeezing veteran security players and driving consolidation is of course the decline of traditional AV revenues, especially on the consumer side where free/freemium antivirus products now dominate. The old paid antivirus cash-cow is not what it once was, with PC shipment slowdowns and the shift to mobile computing another factor driving change there.
“The security industry is obviously really maturing, and — at least on the consumer side — the market has heavily shifted to free and freemium,” noted Steckler. “So there’s a pretty rapidly declining marketshare for companies like Norton and McAfee and Kaspersky.”
But he asserted that Avast and AVG have complementary footprints — with AVG doing well in the English-speaking world and Avast in the non-English speaking world — making the pair a good fit to ride out tougher times together.
“The fact that we have such a large geographic spread allows us to ride much better through the market ups and downs,” he said. “For example, the English language markets are hurt a lot more by the slowdown in PC shipments than the non-English markets. But the English markets monetize much better than the non-English markets, so we have kind of complementary strengths and weaknesses.”
Discussing the shift to mobile computing, Steckler said there are a different set of concerns Avast can (and is) addressing here, via mobile products that focus more on privacy and parental concerns than on traditional malware security threats.
“People use their mobile devices for a lot of different things. You’ve got photos on there, some are sensitive, some are embarrassing, you’ve got children who are using phones while they are driving — you’ve got corporations where phones are being used by employees, sometimes for company use. Sometimes for personal use. So the mobile security market is actually pretty big,” he said.
“It’s not the classic AV but there’s lots of other types of security and privacy products. And this is absolutely one of the reasons why we wanted to buy AVG — because AVG have a really good security product that’s not installed on the phones but is installed at the carrier.”
Running security products directly on phones themselves is pretty limiting, he said — given they are just another siloed app and can be disabled by the user. Which makes working with carriers Avast’s preferred route.
“If you install on the carrier infrastructure you’ve got a lot of things now. For example you can implement a family safety product or geofences so that if your child is driving they can’t text message, or if they’re at school they can’t be using the phone. Or you can control how much data they’re using or what they’re really doing on the mobile device,” he added.
“That’s been a very successful business in the US. It’s in the four US carriers and what we want to do is to move that out of the US and frankly that’s going to be the core of a lot of our mobile business.”
Discussing the company’s strategy for the Internet of Things, he noted Avast already has a security product here, focusing on securing IoT devices via the router. Meanwhile AVG was exploring a different strategy — meaning, again, Steckler sees benefits to combining their different efforts.
But at the end of the day he couches IoT as a fairly simply security nut to crack — given most devices connect to the Internet via a router or network gateway.
“I suspect that most of the security for IoT is going to end up at the cloud or at the network level and not really in the device itself,” he said. “If you think about it, why does your Fitbit need to run security software? It doesn’t talk to the Internet, it talks to the router, so you get the router to protect the Fitbit.”
“Very few of the [IoT] things actually directly connect to the Internet. Most everything connects to the router, which connects to the Internet. So… you don’t need to necessarily protect each device because most of the devices are fairly simplistic. What you need to do is protect the devices from being broken into and the easiest point of doing that is at the network or gateway level. Which is where we do it.”",2016-09-30,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/vince-and-threat-labs.jpg?w=738,"avg-technologies,avast-software,software,freeware",Avast CEO on why it’s just spent $1.4BN to absorb security rival AVG
275,Darrell Etherington,"High-end vehicle, chauffeur included? You can see why it makes sense that Volvo would target the luxury end of the market with its upcoming self-driving car. Volvo announced plans to field a vehicle by 2021, thanks in part to a $300 million deal with Uber that will let it leverage some of their work, but now we have some more details, including the vehicle’s high-end approach.
Volvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson told reporters at today’s Global Mobility Leadership Forum in Detroit that the autopilot function will be an upmarket option that comes with a price tag of somewhere in the neighborhood of $10,000, Bloomberg reports. The car it ships with will include a steering wheel — but only in case the owner opts to debase themselves by actually driving it in the style of the plebeians of the prior age.
But steering wheel or no, Samuelsson says this will be a fully autonomous car, meaning those inside the vehicle can go ahead and kick back and “watch a movie or whatever,” per Bloomberg.
Volvo’s approach is basically par for the course in terms of how new features make their way to consumer cars; start at the rarefied top, and then gradually flow down through the line first as options, then as included features at various trim levels, and finally becoming basically a universal standard.
Where it doesn’t make par is when compared to the approach to autonomous cars seemingly favored by other car makers — Ford is looking to introduce self-driving first in fleets of taxi-style vehicles, and it sounds like GM is planning to do the same. Volvo looking at offering this feature first on vehicles sold to individual drivers for personal ownership is then out-of-step with some of its biggest rivals. Hopefully that means we’ll see both types of approaches to autonomous vehicles hit the road at roughly the same time.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/196281_drive_me_the_world_s_most_ambitious_and_advanced_public_autonomous_driving.jpg?w=738,"autonomous-vehicles,self-driving-cars,volvo",Volvo to target luxury buyers with self-driving car coming in 5 years
276,Devin Coldewey,"HP was recently caught in the act using a “security update” to prevent its printers from operating with a number of recycled and third-party ink cartridges. After much outcry the company has relented and is issuing a rollback option — but they’ll be damned if they admit any wrongdoing.
“We are committed to transparency in all of our communications and when we fall short, we call ourselves out,” the company states in a post entitled “Dedicated to the best printing experience,” which sort of says it all. “There is confusion in the market regarding a printer firmware update – here are the facts.”

The EFF, Cory Doctorow specifically, wrote a letter publicly shaming HP for this anti-consumer behavior, and the questionable application of DRM attracted enough coverage that HP has been forced to, in their words, call themselves out.
“We should have done a better job of communicating about the authentication procedure to customers, and we apologize,” HP’s post continued. “As a remedy for the small number of affected customers, we will issue an optional firmware update that will remove the dynamic security feature. We expect the update to be ready within two weeks.”
Keep an eye on this thread for the download link.
HP, Keurig, Apple, and a hundred other companies all claim to be trying to give you the “best experience” when things of this character occur, but it doesn’t take much to see that the real object is to tie consumers even more tightly to each company’s carefully curated ecosystem. It’s usually pretty clear when that’s a benefit to consumers and when it’s a detriment; don’t be afraid to call them out when it’s the latter.
If you weren’t affected this time, don’t worry — HP will probably give you another chance to get in on the fun:

277,Darrell Etherington,"Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm is looking to shrink the silicon space a bit further with a potential acquisition of Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors, in a deal that could be worth over $30 billion according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal.  The deal could be finalized in as few as two months from now, according to the report. If it goes through, it could signal a big move for Qualcomm in the automotive space.
An NXP takeover by Qualcomm would be the latest in a string of semiconductor industry consolidation moves made recently. The largest of those being the acquisition of ARM by SoftBank, in a deal valued at $32 billion, which means a $30 billion deal between Qualcomm and NXP would only be the second-largest chip-related acquisition this year.
NXP is actually a much larger company when compared to AMD, and it’s also a supplier of components rather than a licensor of designs. With around 45,000 employees spread across 35 countries, it’s the fifth-largest chip supplier in the world, and the leader when it comes to chips related to security-based identification, and especially car-related applications. NXP itself also just underwent some consolidation of its own, merging with Freescale Semiconductor in a deal worth $40 billion last year.
Another claim to fame for NXP is the co-creation of NFC, along with Sony. Qualcomm’s business spans not just semiconductors (which it has an entire subsidiary dedicated to), but also broader telecom products and services.
Qualcomm’s last big disclosed acquisition was a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chipmaker that worked specifically in the automotive world, so if this acquisition report from WSJ proves true, it could be that the through line uniting its recent big purchases

278,John Biggs,"Back in the old days hardware manufacturers felt safe in the knowledge that no mere hardware hacker could attempt to recreate their inventions. From Sony to Philips to LG to Samsung, the consumer electronics industry was locked up and no one could crack the case. Until those meddling Arduino kids came along…
Now anyone can make cool hardware and, thanks to Arduino, it is easier than ever to connect your devices to the Internet and take in data from the outside world. The ESLOV IoT Invention Kit is an official Arduino product that adds Internet of Things capabilities to your hardware products. Trying to build a connected fridge to beat Samsung? Go for it with the ESLOV. Want to knock Sony off its perch? Try popping an ESLOV unit onto your Arduino board and take on major manufacturers from your living room.
Think of the ESLOV system as a sort of Mindstorms on steroids. This self-described “plug-and-play toolkit” lets you connect multiple sensors and outputs together to create various systems. This chart shows a few of the possible permutations. Everything is controlled via Arduino’s online IDE.

The system consists of various sensors as well as a Wi-Fi hub. Interestingly each sensor runs a ATmega328P processor, the same one found on the Arduino Uno. The entry-level $99 kit includes a WiFi and motion hub, a button, a buzzer, and an LED. The Pro model includes a Hall sensor, OLED Display, and GPS – 22 modules in total – for $499. The $249 intermediate kit seems to contain everything you need to get started, however.

279,Devin Coldewey,"Humans are pretty good at ballparking distances, even with one eye closed — but it turns out computer vision systems have a hard time with it. Researchers hope to fix that, or at least make robots a little more robust, by teaching them to navigate a space without the benefit of stereo vision — in zero gravity, to boot.
The reason we’re so good at it is that we’ve built up a huge library of knowledge about the objects and spaces we tend to inhabit: trees are about this big, and don’t grow indoors; TVs are flat and about this big, and tend to be near walls; doors are about this big and you can see the next room through them; etc, etc. It’s all very elementary to us but we often forget how long it took us to learn all that stuff (and how easy it is to unlearn when one is tired or drunk).

But that assumes everything is working properly. What if one of the cameras is taken out of commission by a system error or a leaf blowing onto it? How will it safely navigate if it relies on having both 100 percent of the time? This applies not just to random robots, but to self-driving cars and other devices.
An experiment backed by the European Space Agency and Delft University of Technology investigates the possibility of robots teaching themselves how to get around their environment, effectively, with one eye closed.
“It is a mathematical impossibility to extract distances to objects from one single image, if the object has not been encountered before,” said Delft’s Guido de Croon in an ESA news release. “But if we recognize something to be a car, then we know its physical characteristics, and we can use that information to estimate its distance from us. A similar logic is what we wanted the drone to learn during our experiment.”
The experiment took place on the International Space Station. They equipped a SPHERES (Synchronized Position Hold Engage and Reorient Experimental Satellites, essentially round, multi-purpose drones that work in microgravity) with stereo cameras, and had it roam around the Japanese ISS module. It took measurements with both “eyes,” but also ran a machine-learning task using just one, attempting to keep track of the module’s features and establish distances.
Here’s the raw feed from one of the runs:

For instance, it would see with the stereo cameras that a hatch was 4 feet away and 2 feet wide — and at the same time, the single-camera stream would attempt to associate the image it saw with that information — a certain shape, growing larger at a certain rate, that sort of thing.
The researchers could only dedicate a little time to the experiment — it has to be run by astronauts, after all, and they’re busy people — and the initial run was a mixed bag with several technical difficulties. But the technique has promise, and the single-camera estimate of distance got to be pretty good, though not good enough to navigate by just yet.
They presented their findings today at the International Aeronautical Conference; you can read the paper here.",2016-09-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/stereo_camera_on_iss_drone.jpg?w=565,"space,iss,computer-vision,artificial-intelligence",A robot learns to cope with the loss of an eye in an experiment carried out on the ISS
280,Devin Coldewey,"Elon Musk has a plan to colonize Mars, but he’s not rushing it. In a conference call following the SpaceX CEO’s presentation today at the International Astronautical Conference, Musk noted that the project is still essentially a hobby at the company, drawing only a fraction of its efforts.
In response to a question about whether the company should be worrying about colonizing the solar system when its rockets are still exploding on the ground, Musk was conciliatory.
“Less than 5 percent of SpaceX resources are working on planetary transport stuff,” he said. “So it is very much a secondary or tertiary priority to understanding exactly what happened on the last mission.”
“The pace of progress on Mars depends upon the pace of progress of SpaceX,” he explained. “Our success rate with Falcon 9 is roughly 93 percent — it needs to be a lot better. We need to get Falcon Heavy launched finally, Dragon 2, and make sure we manage the company such that we’ve got sufficient cash flow and funds while it’s developing — and of course, I will supplement that personally.”
In the near term, the Dragon project must go forward both as an integral part of SpaceX’s current business and as a precursor to future missions.

NASA’s Curiosity would be the next-heaviest, and they weren’t concerned about bruising colonists, or taking off again afterwards. The hovering technique worked well for a science buggy, but “you can’t do that with a giant spaceship,” Musk told the audience. It’s also unclear how the dust and debris will fly or provide sufficient resistance to rockets. He was pretty candid about the craft’s chances, in fact.
“I wouldn’t give the first Dragon landing on Mars high odds — I mean, maybe 50 percent. The history of landing on Mars is not a good one,” he admitted. “So for a first timer, I’d say if we get 50 percent likelihood, I’d say that’s pretty good.”
Those are the robotic missions, of course, with 2 slated to launch in 2020 and more whenever it’s practical to do so. For manned missions (which tend to require more than a 50 percent projected success rate), the goal is 2024, but that plan is definitely not etched in stone.
“I mean, that’s optimistic,” he said. “I would describe that as an aspiration, and within the realm of possibility — a lot of things need to go right.”",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-27-at-5-03-02-pm.png?w=738,"mars-colonization,mars","Musk says under 5 percent of SpaceX is working on Mars mission, 2024 launch is ‘optimistic’"
281,Matthew Lynley,"Meetings are probably never going to die — and, along with that, neither are presentations. But the traditional route for making presentations is getting a little outdated, with tools like PowerPoint getting updated regularly but lacking a certain simplicity to them.
That’s why Owen Bossola and Hakim El Hattab decided to start Slides, an online service for creating, viewing and collaborating on slideshow presentations. The goal of Slides is to bring together all the best parts of discrete presentation management services out there, like PowerPoint and SlideShare, and make it one seamless experience.
“There’s always a need for visual storytelling, and Slides at its core is a tool for visual storytelling,” El Hattab said. “Maybe you get more efficient with Slack, but with sales and marketing and education, there’s all these use cases that require presentation software. People present in a thousand different ways. We just try to tackle all of those.”
The creation experience is pretty much what you’d expect. You’ll find various features that are present in a lot of other creation experiences and, following that, users can share links to the presentations and ways to watch them unfold in real time during a meeting. There’s also a limited commenting section built into the service, which is still in the sort of developmental phase, as Bossola and El Hattab didn’t want to feature creep the service right away.
Slideshow presenters can also embed content from other services within the presentations. Because everything is viewed online, everything is therefore rendered on the Web — so rendering complex visuals can be more seamless instead of having to download complex PDF files or 3D visuals.

All this works in Slides’ favor, because it makes the approach to making presentations much more flexible. The composition tool has a quite similar feel to other standard tools (though it’s made to look a little more slick than existing ones), including features like altering the color schema to make sure text doesn’t get washed away in a darker background. The objects snap to a grid, it’s easy to import additional content and users have access to a lot of pre-existing templates — whether they’re made by the company or the standard stock slides offered by the company.
Presenters can also use their phones as a combo clicker-note taking application, using it to advance through slides and review their notes on those slides. The tool — while highly flexible for developers — is clearly geared toward marketers and others who need to put together presentations, and trying to make that whole process as easy and seamless as possible. Naturally, there’s a big market for this (giant applications like PowerPoint wouldn’t get regular updates if it weren’t).
“Since our format, at the end of it, is a website, you have a website for your presentation,” Bossola said. “Within that website you can include anything you can include in a website. All these specific kinds of areas, we have a lot of people in education that use text to write math formulas. We can be instantly flexible because it’s web based.”
There’s an obvious consumer application to all this. It’d be great to have this kind of a tool when giving a presentation in college, for example, instead of having to wander through the Web for other tools or dealing with school licenses for PowerPoint. But the main sweet spot for Slides is going to be larger marketing divisions in companies, which are always going to need good tools to make engaging presentations.
Slides is actually built on some open-source software technology that El Hattab had been developing over time. Developers were using the tools to create presentations, but had to hand-code them — which made El Hattab and Bossola realize they had a potential company on their hands. The company still plans to contribute to that resource, as well as update their service with any new tools components that come in from the community like bug and security fixes. There’s always a risk of building a company on top of open-source software, but El Hattab said that it’s part of the company’s DNA, and there are plenty of success stories like Automattic.
There is, of course, competition in the form of companies like Bunkr and Swipe. The Slides team has quite a long history in the content development space, with Bossola previously working at Thrillist and El Hattab coming from a digital production company. The hope is that if the company can keep the tools as simple, flexible and widely applicable as possible, they’ll finally have a PowerPoint killer on their hands.

282,Matthew Lynley,"Zenefits at one point was one of the fastest growing software companies in the world, rocketing to a $4.5 billion valuation in 18 months. It was on track to generate tens of millions of dollars in annual recurring revenue.
Then, everything went south; regulators started investigating the company, and its CEO Parker Conrad was fired from the company earlier this year. In short, it’s been a bumpy eight months since the incident for new CEO David Sacks, who took over when Conrad exited, and he’s eager to put all that behind the company and himself. He made it abundantly clear on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016. Now the company is looking forward to the launch of its next version of Zenefits, due out next month.
“The way to win trust is to just make right a situation, whatever mistakes you’ve made previously,” Sacks said. “Our attitude at Zenefits today is to be very transparent and forthright about what happened, it’s not to double down on something wrong in the past, it’s to admit it, fix it, and move on. That’s what we’ve done, and I think as a result we’re in a great position to move forward. A lot of pain the company took upfront in the past six months, at this point it’s over, we’re excited to focus on the future.”

Sacks said that he, as well as many other executives, were not aware of the macro after thorough investigation that even drilled into emails. He said after joining as chief operating officer in December 2014, he did not have a number of divisions reporting to him, and was as unaware of the problem as investors were. It’s a small wonder it was kept as tight as it was, but in the end the company has had to aggressively pay for those mistakes.
And there’s still plenty of drama. Zenefits — and Sacks — still seem to have yet to shake the perception that it’s still under fire, even amid its vigorous efforts to put those problems behind it and settle with states. In total, Zenefits has paid out about $300,000 in settlements in six states, Sacks said, though the investigation in California is still ongoing.
Amid all this, the company has had to redirect both the company and its internal culture. In order to head off lawsuits from existing investors, Zenefits cut its valuation in half and the company has laid off more than 350 people. Sacks said the company was down to 900 employees, from 1,450 when he took over as CEO. To say the course-correction is aggressive is a bit of an understatement, but it’s pretty much required for a company that had so many issues when Sacks walked in the door.
“A lot of the stuff was honestly the media getting carried away, that was not something that happened,” Sacks said, likely in reference to a story from The Wall Street Journal about alerting employees not to have sex in the company’s stairwells. “In terms of the culture, what we’ve done is declare new values, the reason we did that is because compliance is really important.”
In terms of Conrad, and his potential ambitions to go after a similar company, Sacks didn’t have much to say. Conrad also took $10 million off the table ahead of his exit, plenty to get something rolling. Sacks said he had not been in touch with Conrad and did not know what he was up to (who, at least with that money, seems like he doesn’t have to just yet win back the trust of investors that Zenefits has to grapple with.)
“My attitude toward valuation, it’s never something you set, it arises through a process,” Sacks said. “People want to invest in a company and the valuation is determined through that. I never take a position on what valuation should be. I do think the company has an obligation to be transparent about everything that’s gone wrong.”",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/disrupt_sf16_david_sacks-3714.jpg?w=738,"david-sacks,techcrunch-disrupt-sf,parker-conrad",CEO David Sacks on moving on from Zenefits’ troubled past
283,Ron Miller,"Salesforce has taken a leading role on LGBT issues and now it is taking that one step further. The company next week will be announcing its first chief equality officer, who will report directly to CEO Marc Benioff.
Benioff speaking on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco with editor-in-chief Matthew Panzarino talked about his commitment to helping improve the world. While he has built charitable efforts and equality into his own company, and he admits there is a self-serving component to this, he believes that companies need to give back.
“We can just focus on our own results, our own tech, but you won’t get the joy that comes from giving, the real pleasure of helping people. You’re not only helping other people, you’re helping yourself,” Benioff says.
Benioff has put his money where is mouth is, giving millions to public schools and working to overturn anti-gay and trans laws in Indiana, Georgia and North Carolina.
It’s widely known that when Benioff and co-founder Parker Harris launched the company, they built the 1/1/1 program into the organization to give back to the community. As they like to joke, there wasn’t anything to give at that point, but over the years as the company has grown and become tremendously successful, it has given over $128 million in grants and employees have volunteered more than 1.6 million hours in the community. Almost 30,000 non-profits are using the Salesforce technology, either at discounted rate or donated.
What’s more, Salesforce has used this program as a template to help other companies launch similar programs with 786 companies joining the pledge one percent movement, including many companies built on the Salesforce platform or launched by former employees of the company
He points out that each company has a set of values to guide the organization, and while profit and building great products is an integral part of that, he hopes companies can use the wealth they gain by making great products to help make the world a better place.
The Chief Equality Officer will build those values into the fabric of the organization, bringing a voice directly to the C suite.",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/marc-benioff7.jpg?w=738,"disrupt,charity,saas",Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff announces new chief equality officer
284,Ingrid Lunden,"Evernote — the popular note taking and productivity startup with 200 million users — has built its reputation around an app that lets you record and track all your life’s details hold them there, for life. Today, the company is shifting gears on the question of how it will keep hold of and track that information: Evernote is migrating all of its data, including some 5 billion notes, to Google’s Cloud Platform. As part of that, it will also start to use Google’s machine learning APIs to help access and use that data in different ways.
As a result, Evernote will be shutting down its previous storage architecture that was based around a private cloud infrastructure, along with some of its own tech. Evernote’s new CTO Anirban Kundu told me the first two areas that will be replaced by Google’s machine learning APIs are its voice recognition for speech-to-text translations; and natural language processing, used to help search for contextual content.
Evernote says it will start the migration to Google in early October, with “a complete migration by the end of 2016.”
“The transition to the cloud will occur completely in the background. You should see no impact to your service during the transition, and you do not need to take any action. Behind the scenes, Evernote will become faster, stronger, and more stable,” Evernote writes. It adds that among the security features that it will gain as a result of the change is encryption at rest, which it said many users have asked for in the past.
One thing that it will not gain are ads, Google’s most important business product.
“Google doesn’t get access to the users’ content to make any assumptions or provide any ads,” Kundu said. “Google Cloud Platform is a separate business unit and not interested in monetizing that content. We have no intention of using ads. Our user data is private to them and we protect that in the highest possible way.”
Evernote and Google are not revealing any financial terms of the deal, but Evernote tells me that it considered all of the usual suspects before picking Google. Microsoft might have been an obvious consideration, although it has been making some strong efforts to suck up Evernote users to its One Note platform, so that may understandably have been a bit awkward.
Evernote’s move underscores a change that is underway in the tech world to doing business “in the cloud.” For some that has meant taking data off premises into storage that you access over the Internet. And for others like Evernote, it underscores a shift from trying to build and run your own cloud services to outsourcing and using a larger company’s infrastructure to cut down costs and shift the job of building the infrastructure to keep that information to a larger provider.
“Evernote was a cloud company from the beginning,” the head of Google’s cloud business, Diane Greene, said in an interview today at TC Disrupt, “but when built it it, there wasn’t a place to put that [data] in the public cloud.”
The move also comes at a critical period for Evernote for other reasons.
The eight year-old startup a year ago parted ways with its longtime CEO and figurehead Phil Libin, who was replaced by current CEO, Chris O’Neill (who happens to be a Google alum). At the same time, the company — which has disclosed about $205 million in funding — has faced valuation markdowns from investors as it lost some of its momentum in terms of growth and overall buzz. Something else it has lost is talent, in the form of several departures of other long-standing execs in the wake of Libin’s exit.
Under new leadership, Evernote has started to make some moves to sort out its business. It has brought in new talent, and it has picked up some interesting new investments from strategic backers like Nikkei (one investment reported, and another unreported, from what I understand). It has also firmed up its revenue structure with more expensive pricing plans.
And, notably, it is cutting out some of its unprofitable operations as it repositions itself to grow in a more healthy way.
“There was a lot there that didn’t make sense,” O’Neill admitted to me last week.
This last development — cutting out some of the less efficient efforts of the business — is where the Google news today fits. Evernote describes the move to Google’s platform as a “natural progression for the company.”
As with any outsourcing project, Evernote’s emphasis is on how it can use the change to channel its resources to other areas.
“By moving its data center operations to Google’s cloud, Evernote can focus on its core competency: providing customers with the best experience for taking, organizing, and archiving notes,” the company writes in a blog post.
Evernote is by no means the first company to jump to Google’s Cloud Platform and use its APIs to run its customer-facing technology. Others on the Google Cloud Platform include Snapchat, Spotify, and Viant. Others using its machine learning APIs include Ocado, Wix, and Disney.
But all the same, it’s a big move for a company that has prided itself in years past on being an agnostic and reliable place for your photos, thoughts and documents, no matter what else happens, despite Evernote’s own past security issues.",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/evernote.jpg?w=738,"note-taking,google-cloud-platform,evernote","Evernote is moving all its data, machine learning tech to Google Cloud Platform"
285,Frederic Lardinois,"Microsoft’s CTO for Azure (and occasional novelist) Mark Russinovich is extremely bullish about microservices. In his view, the vast majority of apps — including enterprise apps — will soon be built using microservices. Microsoft, with its variety of cloud services and developer tools, obviously wants a piece of that market. With Service Fabric, the company offers a service and tooling that makes it easier to run microservices-based applications. Until now, Service Fabric only supported Windows-based machines, but starting September 26, Microsoft will launch a Linux installer for Service Fabric as a public beta, too.
As Russinovich explained to me, Microsoft itself has been using the microservices approach internally for seven years. It wasn’t until the cloud went mainstream, though, that this approach became something smaller companies could use, too. “The way we see it is that microservices and the cloud were really meant for each other,” he said. The cloud allows you to spin up machines instantaneously — and once you layer the idea of microservices on top, you provide a far greater degree of agility to developers than was possible before (using microservices, after all, you can update and work on separate components of an application without having to worry about the other parts of the apps).
“Having been developed almost a decade ago, [Service Fabric] was focused on Windows and .NET. But more and more we are seeing that customers — when they are looking at choices for how they are building their applications — are looking for a platform that can run anywhere and on any operating system.”
Microsoft’s internal use of microservices and Service Fabric means that the service is both battle-hardened and fully featured. Russinovich stressed that Microsoft’s experience led the team to add rollback, versioning and automatic healing features, for example. “We want to make this accessible and democratize microservices,” he said.
With the standalone Linux installer, operators will be able to use Service Fabric to manage their on-premises, as well as for hybrid and multi-cloud microservices, deployment.
With this move to Linux, Microsoft is also making command-line interface tooling, as well as Eclipse and Jenkins support, available to developers. “Ultimately, our goal is that developers can build Service Fabric applications on the OS of their choice and run them wherever they want,” Russinovich writes in today’s announcement.",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-452481532.jpg?w=738,"microsoft-azure,linux",Microsoft’s Azure Service Fabric for running and managing microservices is coming to Linux
286,Ron Miller,"In what has to be characterized as huge win for Microsoft, it announced this morning it had secured a 6-year deal with HP, Inc to run Microsoft Dynamics’ customer relationship management (CRM) and service software.
What’s more, it grabbed this deal at the expense of its rivals. HP, Inc. had been a Salesforce CRM customer, while Oracle had been its service software provider. It’s worth noting this is a customer Salesforce bragged about in its literature and featured at its conference.
HP, Inc is the printer and PC division that HP spun off last year when it split HP into two companies, the other being HPE, the enterprise software division. Under the new deal, HP Inc’s 6,500 sales people and 20,000 service employees worldwide will be using Microsoft’s sales and service software.
Brent Leary, who has been watching the CRM space for years as co-founder and partner at CRM consulting firm, CRM Essentials, sees this as confirmation that Microsoft’s work to beef up the product could be paying off.
“The combination of CRM, collaboration, intelligence and productivity Microsoft has put together in the cloud is going to make enterprises at least take a serious look at what they have to offer,” Leary told TechCrunch.
Over the last couple of years, Microsoft has been working to upgrade Microsoft Dynamics CRM, combining it with its Dynamics ERP product earlier this year, and while Microsoft and Salesforce have been on friendly terms of late, with Satya Nadella appearing at the Dreamforce customer conference last Fall, they are still are fierce competitors where business is concerned.
Interoperability is one thing, and both companies certainly recognize the need to work with one another’s products, but that’s where it ends. When it comes down to it, both companies are going to be competing hard for customers, and in this case, Microsoft took one right out from under Salesforce. They can’t be happy about this, and you have to wonder if it will strain their relationship.
It’s also worth noting that when Microsoft grabbed LinkedIn for $26 billion last spring, it likely had much to do with enhancing its CRM offerings. Rumor had it at the time, that perhaps Salesforce had also been sniffing around LinkedIn. It certainly couldn’t hurt that Microsoft will very likely integrate LinkedIn information directly into Dynamics CRM over the next year, giving its customers access to a treasure trove of customer data.
As for Oracle, HP and Oracle didn’t have much love for one another anyway. Former CEO Mark Hurd left HP after a scandal in 2010 and went running into the arms of Oracle. Shortly thereafter a nasty lawsuit ensued over Oracle dropping support for HP’s Itanium chip set (a chip that ultimately never really took off anyway). These kinds of fights are beginning to hurt the database giant.
It’s important not to over-emphasize the importance of a single win, even one of this scope. Yet this deal has the potential at least to give Microsoft some much-needed enterprise credibility in the CRM space, a space Salesforce and Oracle have dominated for years. For that reason alone, Microsoft has to being doing a happy dance this morning while its rivals have to be pouting over their morning coffee.",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-137777051.jpg?w=738,hp,Microsoft snatches HP CRM and service business from rivals Salesforce and Oracle
287,Ingrid Lunden,"As LinkedIn continues to wait for the close of its $26.2 billion acquisition by Microsoft, it continues to build out its business, with the latest developments on the international front. Last week, LinkedIn announced that it had hit 100 million users in Asia Pacific (around one-quarter of its total), and today at an event in Bengaluru, India, it unveiled three new products it’s rolling out in India, where it has 37 million users, that it hopes will now get them (and others) using the site more.
LinkedIn Lite is a new pared-down mobile version of LinkedIn that is designed to work on lower-end handsets and those that are accessing the site with limited or very expensive mobile data services. It will be rolling out in the next couple of weeks, a spokesperson tells me.
Meanwhile, the company has also launched a service called LinkedIn Placements to provide an online test for users and help place them in jobs. And for businesses, it’s launched LinkedIn Starter Pack to set up and run their profiles on the social platform.
LinkedIn Lite. Today at the event in Delhi, CEO Jeff Weiner said that LinkedIn Lite would be rolling out to users in the country in the next few months. As with other “lite” versions made for mobile, LinkedIn’s service does away with things like extra graphics and rich media to download four times faster than LinkedIn’s basic mobile site. The company claims the homepage only takes up 150 KB of data, and further pages 70 KB.
From the looks of the screenshots here, it appears the Lite version may simply be turned on by default in situations where bandwidth might be tight: as you can see the URL is LinkedIn’s basic linkedin.com.
LinkedIn Lite is a late entrant into a market that has seen a number of other attempts to grow usage numbers in India by meeting their mobile data demands: while the vast majority of people in India (which is the world’s second largest smartphone market after China) use mobile phones rather than PCs to access the internet, more generally data is very expensive for the average user, and connectivity is not as fast.
Facebook has been offering pared-down versions of its own social network for years now aimed at developing markets. They include Facebook Lite, an Android app launched in 2015. And Zero, a text-only version introduced in 2010. Controversially, it’s also worked with carriers to launch free versions of its site, too, under the Basics brand: many complained, however, that the service violated net neutrality rules and it eventually got shut down in India. Twitter has also worked on ways of developing its own lighter versions and specific services for markets like India.
LinkedIn Placements. While Lite is designed to get people using LinkedIn more on a daily basis, Placements is a service aimed at making LinkedIn more practical and useful for them.
Here, LinkedIn has partnered with HackerRank, as well as Aspiring Minds, Co-cubes and Wheebox, to develop an online test for users to show off their skills and interests, which are then matched up with a number of jobs being advertised on the site. You then proceed with the usual job finding process that involves interviews, references and more. There are some 50 jobs already up for Placements through the scheme in areas like software development, marketing and finance. (The emphasis initially seems to be software: HackerRank, which powers the first test, specialises in engineering and programming skills tests.)

Placements is an interesting development that touches several parts of LinkedIn’s bigger business strategy. The company has been moving very aggressively into online education services, spearheaded perhaps most obviously with its acquisition of Lynda.com, and this is an interesting development that ties in another way of using the online testing format to help boost another part of LinkedIn’s business.
That other part, of course, is recruitment advertising, which today is the company’s biggest revenue driver. Right now, while LinkedIn is spreading the word about the Placement service to would-be jobseekers, it’s also encouraging businesses to place their ads on the platform to match up those people with positions.
In a market that may have a lot of self-taught programmers and others, it provides one way of trying to circumvent the normal course of students graduating from a particular university, or otherwise be overlooked in the job market. This also potentially gives LinkedIn a more central place in how it believes its platform can influence what Weiner has described as the “economic graph” of our society.
The other area where Placements will help LinkedIn’s bigger business is in getting more users to give it more information. Part of the scheme involves updating and filling out your own profile on the site before you take the online test, which will give LinkedIn a new opportunity to pick up fresh and accurate data about you.
Starter Pack. The last of these is less obvious for consumer users but is an interesting compendium to how LinkedIn hopes to grow its profile as a directory for businesses online, and potentially develop those relationships, too. The promise for the companies that build profiles on LinkedIn’s platform is that they can market themselves better: “Grow your Brand. Grow your Team. Grow your Influence,” is how LinkedIn describes it. More practically, it will give LinkedIn an avenue to court these companies for more recruitment and other ads; and perhaps down the line, after the deal with Microsoft closes, it will give it an avenue to sell more Microsoft products to them, too.
“India is a vital market for LinkedIn, as we work towards realising our vision of creating economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce,” said Akshay Kothari, Country Manager and Head of Product, LinkedIn India, in a statement. Kothari joined LinkedIn when the company acquired Pulse, the newsreading app he co-founded. “It’s already one of the world’s most important economies, and continues to experience strong GDP growth. While LinkedIn has grown multiple folds in India since we started operating here 6 years ago, there’s so much more we want to do here. We are committed to India and to boosting our ability to deliver value to even more members and be a part of their professional growth journey, by investing and innovating locally.”",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/linkedin-india.jpg?w=738,,"LinkedIn courts users in India with LinkedIn Lite, online job placement tests, business tools"
288,Ron Miller,"Box CEO Aaron Levie has been at it for more than a decade. For a guy barely past 30, that means it’s all he’s done professionally for his entire adult life. You could forgive him if he were thinking about another challenge, but even after all this time, the fire still clearly burns for Levie.
When I asked him about possibly getting bored in an in-person interview this week at BoxWorks, he paraphrased Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who is a Box customer, saying “if you’re bored, you’re not being creative enough.”
I’ve been having regular conversations with Levie since 2009 when he was trying to get his young startup some attention. Today, as a public company and all the responsibility that entails, it still seems to me that he’s in it to win it. He wants to continue to build his company into an enterprise powerhouse, one that can take on the biggest software companies in this space.
He wouldn’t comment about rumors that there have been large companies sniffing around Box about an acquisition, but he said he’s still  very much focused on being an independent company.
“I think if you look at past 3-6 months, and look at the M&A market, there is more of an appetite for tech companies, for disruptive fast-growing companies. We will do $396M in revenue, which is our guidance for this year. We are disrupting a $30-40 billion market. We are maybe one percent of the way to where we want to accomplish. We’ve been doing this for over a decade, but we are so early in this mission and journey. We remain focused on staying independent and building the company ourselves.”
Part of the problem seems to be that even after all this time, many people still don’t get what Box does, yet he doesn’t seem frustrated by this. He just keeps plugging away and says, while the general public and Wall Street may still have trouble identifying what he’s trying to do, he doesn’t let it affect his ultimate mission.
“We’ve been very consistent with our long-term view,” Levie told me. “If you measured your value by stock price, you would be frustrated, but we hear from our customers and they see the value. That’s why we build technology,” he said.
He says the company is continuing to change, grow and evolve because it sees the way people work changing, and that’s what keeps it interesting for him. “We were on the disruptive side for a number of years, at the same time when we look at the next decade about how companies will work, trends of today will be more broad and significant — big data, machine learning, analytics — much bigger tends than what drove Box in 2005. We have to build a product for the future,” he said.
He understands that it’s his job to explain to Wall Street and the broader world beyond the customers that are on board already, what that vision entails and how the company plans to get there. If they don’t understand, he needs to refine his message to be more clear. That said, there’s plenty of room to grow and change and that is what seems to keep driving him.
“What’s great about this, is there is always something to get excited about. Change makes it impossible to become bored. We try to focus on things that are exciting and transformational,” he said.",2016-09-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/aaron-levie21.jpg?w=738,"workflow,collaboration,aaron-levie","After more than a decade, the fire still burns for Box CEO Aaron Levie"
289,Jay Donovan,"Kinetise, an app building platform and Disrupt hackathon favorite, aims to democratize the the the process of creating native mobile apps for iOS and Android in the enterprise. Using a drag-and-drop interface, the system essentially lets you build and deploy native apps, visually. In this way, non-developers are able to create and deploy mobile apps.
The company originally focused on selling app development to startups but soon found that “citizen developers” inside of big enterprise organizations were using the platform to make one-off apps for data collection. The company recently added a number of enterprise-ready features as a result including encrypted connections, powerful database tools, and improved GPS location management. This means that a lay user in a corporation could use the platform to track deliveries, collect insurance claims in the field, or simply create time-tracking apps.
Historically I have been suspect of platform approaches like this. When I first encountered these kinds of tools a few years ago, their main use was for developers to be able to build mobile apps for multiple operating systems (like iOS, Android, Blackberry) from a single logical base of business rules and then publish multiple apps simultaneously.
Not being a hardcore developer myself, I heard different opinions from different developers at that time. More traditional developers I spoke with loved the idea and were hopeful that there could be massive time savings. Mobile developers I spoke with were pessimistic and thought the tools would be brittle and inflexible for solving true mobile solutions in native languages.
But Kinetise’s system is far more robust than others I’ve seen and honestly what interested me the most about it were some of the outcomes the team discovered.
In a quick skype call with Kinetize’s CEO Piotr Pawlak, he described a key insight he and his team noticed prior to one deployment.
“We started our product as an easy way to make native apps. We were pretty popular with startups and experimenters but we saw something really interesting: enterprises were using our product to make one-off apps,” he said. “We did a little research and it looks like enterprise is following what Gartner called the “Citizen Developers” model: they’re building internal apps instead of web pages.”
Therein lies one of Kinetise’s strengths. It is a rapid development program for internal, enterprise apps. Granted, the platform still has a way to build apps for regular public deployment in app stores too, but enterprise seems to be a major target and strength.
I can see this advantage, as there are definitely many, large workforces of remote, mobile, enterprise workers out there who need mobile tools that have the ability to function “offline” when network connectivity is not possible. For these scenarios, native mobile apps are a great solution and would have an advantage over mobile websites.
“Kinetise is not another template-based apps creator,” said Pawlak. “We are not building apps for restaurants, beauty-parlors, etc. We offer real, custom apps, but without coding. Our customers put those apps together like kids put together LEGO bricks but when they’re done they have a working app on Android and iOS. No one else can say that.”
The client responses they are getting are fueling their confidence that their approach is robust enough be a legit development tool and are aiming to disrupt the the status quo of mobile app development.

290,Ron Miller,"When Amazon CTO Werner Vogels talks about his company’s philosophy around innovation, it’s probably a good idea to listen. Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos has always found a way to capitalize on technology trends, whether being an early online retailer, seeing the future of cloud computing and forming Amazon Web Services, or developing delivery drones and commercial rockets.
Speaking at BoxWorks this week, Vogels says his company relies on several key building blocks and the ‘Flywheel Effect’ to maintain its technology edge. The Flywheel Effect is the idea that once you have your core tech pieces in place, they have an energy of their own that drives other positive changes and innovations.
“You have to do a lot of innovation that sits under the covers. Anything you do like this will become a flywheel and will drive innovation,” he said.
“We’ve built stuff nobody has built before with development process and methodologies that didn’t exist,” he said. Early on, when Amazon started AWS, the cynical wondered who would want to buy storage from a book shop. Vogels said that the idea that Amazon was a retailer, because that’s what it was at first, really stuck in everyone’s mind.
“We may be a retailer, but we are a tech company at heart. When Jeff started Amazon, he didn’t start it to open book shop. He was fascinated by the internet,” Vogels explained.
Vogels says whatever they do at Amazon, it all starts with the customer and they work backwards from that. In practice, that means whatever they create there are five pillars supporting every move including security, performance, reliability, scalability and cost. He says the company is continually innovating those five core services.
He says when you combine these principles with a customer-centric approach good things are going to happen. Vogels says working for Bezos, there isn’t a week that goes by that he doesn’t learn something. “He’s an amazing thinker and strategist, and an amazing visionary.”
The biggest lesson he’s learned from Bezos is that you must have a vision whatever you’re doing. He says Bezoz describes two types of companies: missionaries and mercenaries.  Mercenaries build products with a sale in mind, while missionaries build products because they believe deeply in the products.
“We are missionaries. It’s why do we do innovation, to make life better for our customers.” Vogels said.",2016-09-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_2882.jpg?w=738,"aws,werner-vogels",At Amazon the Flywheel Effect drives innovation
291,Ron Miller,"Online tools like Office 365 have changed the way we work and collaborate with our colleagues, but often projects involve people outside of your organization, whether partners, consultants or vendors. Microsoft acknowledged that reality today when it announced the ability to invite guests to view or edit Office 365 content.
It’s not going to all happen at once, but over time Office 365 users will be able to include outside parties in their project. For starters, they are rolling out guest access in Outlook on the web with the idea that you need to be able invite these folks to the party.
A welcome email will be the guest’s entree to the project, so it’s a logical starting point. You simply click the Add Guest link and enter the person’s email to get started. The guest receives a welcome email and will be sent emails and calendar invites and can even access file attachments.
All guests have to sign into Microsoft to get Office 365 access, but they can be part of any email domain, even if it’s not part of a business.
It’s worth noting that this could be part of a larger trend. Just this week, Box announced Box Relay, a new workflow tool developed in conjunction with IBM that includes the ability to invite people outside the organization to be part of a project workflow.
In Box’s case, it enables the project lead to set security for the guests, so they might be given read-only document access, while an internal team member would get full editing rights.
Both companies are acknowledging the changing nature of work in a modern cloud and mobile context. People can work anywhere and can collaborate with any number of individuals, whether they work directly for the organization or not.
Being able to include these people as part of the project team is going to become increasingly important and Microsoft’s announcement today is proof of that.",2016-09-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-481292765.jpg?w=738,"collaboration,office-365",Office 365 now lets you invite guests to your projects
292,Ron Miller,"It may not seem it, but coming up with an idea for your startup is probably the easiest part of launching your own company. As one industry insider told me, there are a million ways to screw up that idea through poor execution, and many, many lose their way. Yet a precious few fight through the problems and the challenges, and somehow, with a bit of luck and a lot of moxie, make it to IPO.
The four original founders of Box, one of those companies that made it through that long journey, talked about their experience in a panel discussion this week at BoxWorks.
While CEO Aaron Levie and CFO Dylan Smith have long been the public faces of Box, there were two others — Jeff Queisser, chief systems architect and Sam Ghods, services architect — all childhood friends in Seattle, who quit college to follow the startup dream.
The group seemed destined to launch some sort of startup, and often bounced ideas off one another, even after they went their separate ways to college. After Levie came up with the idea of what would be Box as part of a marketing class, the group saw potential — at least Smith did. Ghods didn’t see the value right away, but eventually all four were on board and Box was born.
These guys were living a Silicon Valley cliché in the early days, giving birth to their idea in a dorm room, then quitting school and renting out a converted garage that acted as their office and living space. You have to remember, these were four young men in their early twenties with no business experience whatsoever, yet they fell into their roles, as Levie with some marketing classes would be CEO, Smith with his financial sensibilities became CFO, Ghods with some coding background headed up engineering and Queisser, who had spent summers installing cable modems, became the de facto head of IT.
The core group soon began selling Box subscriptions and were making a little bit of money. They even found an early backer at DFJ, who gave them some initial funding and helped form their fledgling board of directors.
One of the first inflection points for any startup is when you move beyond the core group of founders and begin to look for additional employees. The core group has passion, and in the case of Box, were four guys who had grown up together, further complicating the hiring dynamic — but as with everything, they had some luck in the deal (and they have some advice for those starting on that journey now).
The core team knew they were looking for a good cultural fit, but they were warned don’t get people who have the same exact skills and think just the way you do because you just get an echo chamber. Early on, any startup needs people who can cover a lot of jobs. When you get a little bigger, specialization begins to take over.
Even if they weren’t quite sure what they were looking for, they had a sense. They definitely had a “no asshole” rule and they needed someone they would be comfortable brainstorming with in a small room for hours. They lucked out when they brought in Karen Appleton as their eighth or ninth employee. She brought a level of professionalism and business experience the founders lacked, and she encouraged them to form partnerships.
“We were 19 or 20 years old. We didn’t know how it would work to hire more experienced people. Karen was the first of those hires and changed our hiring trajectory from cultural fit to cultural add,” Smith explained.
One thing that most startups do is pivot from the original idea, and Box was no exception. In about 2007, they began to recognize that consumer online storage was becoming increasingly specialized with Flickr handling photos and YouTube video. They didn’t think they could compete with that, and at the same time they began to recognize a need for a file-sharing product for business.
There were a lot of heavy discussions about how to proceed. Eventually Box switched to the enterprise, but they didn’t make the transition willy-nilly. They actually went out and hired a consultant, who made some calls and gathered some data for them to confirm they were making a sound decision. You have to remember in 2007, the iPhone was just coming out and it wasn’t obvious that content and collaboration would move to the cloud. The consultant confirmed that some companies were thinking about this and there would be a business in that space.
There was still a lot of discussion among the founders, but they eventually all agreed it was the way to go — and it turned out to be a good decision.
A couple of years later, the iPad came out and this was a major turning point. “I had a simple rule of thumb. Bet on whatever Steve Jobs is betting on,” Levie joked. The company turned its attention to the iPad right away and was one of the first enterprise companies with an iPad app. It was then that they realized content management was changing in a big way and it was going to be about protecting content in motion.
The founders learned you need to compromise, and that was all part of the process. They also were voracious readers, and reading books like The Innovator’s Dilemma and Crossing the Chasm helped shape the company philosophy over time.
They all recommend getting mentors and learning as much as you can, because it’s tough going it on your own. You don’t know what you don’t know, and mentors who have been through the startup experience can help point you in the right direction — and they found when they asked, people generally wanted to help.
They also say there will be scary moments in the life of any company. They point to 2008 when they went looking for a Series B round in the middle of a huge economic crisis as one of those times.
There will also be tough times. You will definitely fight with your co-founders and you may question what you’re doing, but if you believe in the core mission, you can reach the goal of becoming a public company. It worked for Box — and it’s worth noting that the four founders remained close friends through it all.",2016-09-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_2835-1.jpg?w=738,"startups,aaron-levie,ipos","It’s a long, hard road from idea to IPO"

294,Matthew Lynley,"Managing the App Store can be one of the most difficult experiences for new developers. Getting noticed is hard, the experience isn’t that great, and now Apple is allowing search ads. And to make things more interesting, there’s a lot of interest in different platforms beyond traditional apps — including messaging bots.
Eventually, there will have to be a way to seamlessly develop applications that can thread across multiple platforms like messenger bots and, theoretically, more suped-up web browser experiences. That’s what Ernestine Fu, a part-time partner at Alsop Louie partners, is hoping to get done with a new company called Blackstorm. The company said today that it has raised $33.5 million from investors like Rakuten, Highland Capital, executives at Oculus, and a number of other angel investors, as well as Alsop Louie.
“If you think about the market right now, everyones using apps right now, all apps are built on iOS and Android, and the distribution is controlled by Apple and Google. Giant companies like Uber and Lyft have been entirely built entirely on these app stores. If you think about whats next, where are we actually going to have new distribution platforms, that can exist in the form of one messenger, apps within app environments, IoT, mobile browsers, the goal of this company is powering the infrastructure to trade and distribute software to all the post app-store platforms.”

Now, it would seem, the race is on for Messenger applications. Case in point, Apple is opening up its iMessage service to third-party developers (as well as a whole lot of other things), and Facebook and Slack are aggressively trying to attract developers to build bots and other services within the platform. A lot of this is playing catch-up to the experience originally created and popularized by WeChat in China, Fu said, and is long overdue.
“Every time there’s a new platform that’s created, there’s new problems,” Fu said. “There’s two in particular that stand out, the first one is it’s hard for developers to embrace new tools and technology. The second aspect in the beginning it’s also very inefficient to distribute to users. And at the end of the life cycle it gets really inefficient in that only the Triple-A top tier content with millions in marketing will have a big audience. I think traditionally platform shifts have endured these pains over many years and evolved to have a mutual balance, but now there’s an explosion of computing platforms.”
Right now, Blackstorm consists of two products: what Fu is calling the Neo Store, and a development environment that can spread across multiple different types of user experiences like messengers. The former is a white-label service for companies like telecom providers to deliver additional content beyond using just an App Store using web portals, Fu said. The latter, for now, includes an IDE, but the aim there is to just make it easy for developers to publish across multiple platforms regardless of the experience.
But with the emergence of new platforms comes the race to develop for it, get there first, and stick a flag in it in order to attract early adopters. Of course, silly apps will be there, but developers will eventually create use cases that piggyback and work really well on messengers, and they’ll eventually be starting with just one (probably Facebook, the biggest one). They’re going to need to find ways to branch out to new platforms as they emerge, as well as existing ones, and that’s something that Blackstorm hopes to facilitate.
It’s also going to require a shift in user behavior. Normally we interface with a bunch of squares on our screen that we download from the App Store. There’s certainly a lot of drop-off from between someone linking an app through a messenger to downloading the app, and inevitably setting up an account. The square grid on your phone probably isn’t going away — you can already save web applications to the screen, for example — but the whole experience of sharing and playing around with apps is likely shifting to suit whatever environment you exist in at the moment you want to interact with it.
Apple has taken a lot of effort to level the playing field for the App Store. It recently began efforts to remove abandoned apps and fight spammy app names. All this is aimed to make the App Store experience more palatable, but it’s hard to say if that will be successful. Developers are going to follow the audience and a more seamless development experience may end up also attracting early adopters.
Fu thinks that Blackstorm will one day be able to replace the App Store. That’s pretty aggressive and for the foreseeable future, seems really unlikely. But that’s not to say that it can’t co-exist with the App Store for the time being — and, who knows what the future holds as user behavior shifts. WeChat is a prime example of a ton of usage existing within a different application beyond just an App Store. Other new platforms, like VR and various connected devices, are also still in their infancy and it’s not clear if they will become widely used.",2016-09-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_3742.jpg?w=738,"bots,app-store",Blackstorm raises $33.5M to help developers get their apps everywhere beyond the App Store

296,Ron Miller,"Box has always been known as the irritant in the content management industry, that plucky cloud upstart ready to take on the staid and conservative on-prem competition, but after more than a decade in the business, a public company for 18 months, perhaps the company felt it was time to disrupt itself.
Today, at the BoxWorks customer conference, it announced a “new Box” with an updated file system design, new Notes collaboration tool functionality and Box Relay (announced yesterday) for business process creation.
The three taken together provide a range of content management functionality that puts it on par with its more mature competition. When you combine it with the announcements over the last year around governance, enterprise key management, Box Zones (the ability to store Box in-country, even on another storage service) and Box Shuttle (to move legacy content to the cloud), you have a much more complete set of services, one expects from a fully developed content management vendor.
None of the updates announced today with the exception of the new Box Relay tool are all that innovative, but they do simplify the act of working with files and collaborating with team members around content stored in Box. In general, they talked about things being more streamlined and running much faster (but of course we won’t know how fast that is until the final products are actually released over the coming months). They are also improving search and using metadata associated with files to help understand, locate and move content inside of Box.
Box announced updates to all three of its access points on the web, the desktop and mobile. The web gets a new media viewer including the ability to view 3D and 360 degree images (mobile gets this too) and HD video. There’s a new Excel viewer too and real-time co-authoring in Office 365.
The desktop also will get its share of enhancements including new favorites and recents folders to make it easier to find the documents you work on most frequently. It’s not fancy, but it’s useful and the idea here is to improve the end user experience.
The morning keynote also emphasized its partnerships with IBM, Microsoft and Google. In fact, representatives from all three companies appeared on stage including Diane Greene, head of Google Cloud. Google announced a fresh partnership with Box to integrate Google Docs more directly into Box, something they had been able to do in the past, but the new integration is being billed as much smoother.
The companies also announced integration with Springboard, Google’s search tool.
Some of the web enhancements will be available today, but most of the other changes will be rolled out over the next six months with the mobile changes coming in October or perhaps later, and the desktop won’t be ready until some time next year.
That delay has to disappoint users hungry for the updates now, but substantive change doesn’t come easily, and this level of updates will take some time to come to market. Box is shooting for transformative change, and apparently that takes time to bring to fruition.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_2794.jpg?w=738,"content-management,diane-greene,aaron-levie",Box introduces “New Box” at BoxWorks
297,Matthew Lynley,"The iPhone’s base-level storage — starting at 16GB — has been a sticking point for quite a while. More and more content has become available over time in the form of video, apps and photos, and it can be a big limiting factor forcing users to shell out extra cash in order to skirt those requirements.
Today, fortunately, that era comes to an end. The cheapest version of the iPhone 7 now comes with 32GB of storage rather than the traditional 16GB. This brings the iPhone roughly in line with a lot of the other base-level storage options that competing smartphones have.
This is going to be a big delight for potential iPhone buyers. While streaming has become the most widely-adopted method for watching video or listening to music, it doesn’t remove the need for a lot of storage when apps start requiring more and more space — not to mention storing more photos as the fidelity of those photos and the space required increases over time.
The 32GB version of the iPhone 7 will cost $649.

298,Darrell Etherington,"Sure there’s some kind of fruit-related event going on right now, but this week is also BoxWorks, the annual conference for the enterprise content cloud platform provider. At that event, Box CEO Aaron Levie and Google’s SVP of Google’s cloud offerings Diane Greene are announcing a partnership that turns Box into a third-party storage option for Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, and that makes Box-stored content searchable via Google Springboard.
The tie-up makes Box a storage option for housing Google documents, spreadsheets and slide presentations, letting users of Google’s cloud-based productivity suite work directly from their existing Box-based storage repositories. That’s a useful addition for sure, because while a number of enterprise organizations use Google’s offerings for collaboration and creation, a decent number of those actually use Box for cloud-base storage since it’s the solution that was actually designed specifically for business use.
The integration also means users go Google Springboard, the enterprise-focused search engine it revealed earlier this year that acts a digital assistant surfacing content from across an user’s Google Apps, and which employs AI to make smart recommendations about what info to present to users and when. The new Box link-up for Springboard will surface content stored in its enterprise accounts via search alongside Google-stored content.
It may seem a little odd for Google to be collaborating with Box on cloud storage when Google has its own offering there, which is also a revenue driver for the search giant. But the partnership is actually only really likely to benefit customers of both groups, without really biting into the customer base of either, given the distinctions between what Box and Google Drive can provide.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/aaron-levie6.jpg?w=738,"presentation-software,cloud-applications",Box teams up with Google for Docs and Springboard integration

300,Edward Tse,"

People have often referred to Google, Facebook and Twitter as cases where foreign tech companies are blocked in China. In reality, while Facebook and Twitter were indeed blocked, Google chose to withdraw because they didn’t want to comply with Chinese censorship regulations.
It’s important to note that most foreign tech companies were not blocked, and companies like eBay, Amazon, Viadeo and, of course, Apple and Samsung all entered and competed in China.
EBay was beaten by Alibaba more than a decade ago. Amazon entered China through the acquisition of a local company, Joyo, in 2004, but was never able to build a commanding position in China the way they did in the U.S. Viadeo withdrew in 2015 due to a lack of market traction mostly because of the entry of LinkedIn. 
On the other hand, Apple and Samsung have done well in China, despite increasing competition from the Chinese who are chipping off pieces of their pies. More recently, Uber China and Didi Chuxing reached a mutually beneficial deal, though some see it as Uber essentially surrendering the China market to Didi Chuxing. 
This all seems to beg the question: Can foreign tech companies win in China?
Clearly, China’s regulatory regime regarding the internet, in particular social media, is far more restrictive than that of the U.S. and many other western countries in general. The “Great Firewall” has proven itself repeatedly to be a thorn in the side of foreign companies, and not all have been able to overcome this hurdle. Most have tried, but with varying degrees of success.
It all comes down to the company’s mindset and willingness to adapt. Some firms decided they didn’t want to play in such a context, like Google, and withdrew their operations. Some want to play but got blocked, like Facebook, yet continue to lobby the government for access. Some were allowed to play but couldn’t quite get their act together (for whatever reason), like Amazon, Viadeo and perhaps even Airbnb. There was also Yihaodian, which was Walmart’s online business, but eventually Walmart sold it to JD.com in exchange for some of JD’s shares.
But there are some who seem to “get it,” like LinkedIn (at least for now). They entered the China market in 2014 with a dedicated Chinese site, Lingying, and within two years grew their user base to 20 million subscribers and counting. How did they manage such a feat where several others failed? They adapted to the China context. Not only did they localize by conforming to restrictions on content, they partnered with local firms Sequoia China and China Broadband Capital to further understand the China market. 
LinkedIn also created local leadership by hiring a president for LinkedIn China, giving the team more autonomy to integrate and cater to local needs. Examples include collaborating with Tencent’s WeChat so users could link profiles, launching a Chinese business social networking app “Chitu” and planning to release a Chinese version of its Pulse news reader app. 
Another such example is Evernote. They, too, found success through a focus on meaningful localization. Not only did they hire locally, they employed localized marketing strategies by leveraging local social media like Weibo and WeChat, and had localized customer service, which supports real-time customer support on the mentioned platforms. They did thorough market research before entering in 2012, and looked to solve the “pain points” of the Chinese consumer, mainly security and privacy. Lastly, they had an easy-to-recall Chinese name (Yinxiang Biji) with a memorable pun. This strategy paid off; within the first year after launch they had 4 million users in China, and by 2015 their user base reached 17 million.
The notion that lower-quality clones sprung up because of foreign tech companies being blocked is only partially right. One could argue that the major Chinese social websites of Baidu, Ren Ren, Sina Weibo and Youku Toudu are clones of Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, respectively. While the likes of Ren Ren weren’t able to replicate Facebook-like success in China, others have evolved beyond being clones to having their own unique, innovative ecosystems. 
One such example is WeChat. Though it was originally inspired by Kik, and had similar features to WhatsApp, it evolved from mere messaging to becoming an integral part of the Chinese connected lifestyle. WeChat users can now link their bank cards to WeChat Pay, make in-store payments, transfer money to peers, buy movie tickets, hail taxis, pay for utility bills and so on. In fact, the list is practically endless, and shows how WeChat’s business model has become so powerful, and has grown from being a simple messaging app like WhatsApp (which, incidentally is also not blocked in China, but cannot hope to compete on WeChat’s scale).
Importantly, Chinese innovators are developing new intellectual capital. They are crafting innovative business models and reaching new frontiers of business strategy and organization. Prime examples include Alibaba and LeEco. Jack Ma has built Alibaba into a sprawling internet business through “multiple jumping” from one business area to another, while building its capabilities along the way through a combination of self-built and collaborative partnerships. This disrupted the conventional “core competence” approach that has ruled modern business for the past 30-odd years. 
LeEco is, broadly speaking, a “lifestyle” company, with a diverse ecosystem of infotainment content, smart devices and internet-connected mobility. Many commentators by now have pointed out that Chinese innovators are fast, agile and adaptive.  However, these are merely phenomenological observations. At heart, the best and brightest of these innovators are deeply reflective on what the new frontiers of business are, focusing on “how can we get it right and do it well?”
Of course, China’s market for tech companies has evolved significantly for over a decade and a half. When Alibaba was competing with eBay more than a decade ago, China’s tech market was pretty primitive. Alibaba merely used guerrilla warfare tactics based on its grit to defeat a major foreign player. Today, both the market and the players are much more sophisticated and their business approaches are much more refined. The leading Chinese innovators are digital ecosystem players building scale and creating customer stickiness through their entire ecosystem.  Foreign tech players tend not to be as extensive in ecosystem building.
To “win,” foreign tech companies need to adapt to the China context and deeply understand the key factors of success. Local leadership is critical and appropriate empowerment by the global headquarters to the local leadership to do the right things is essential. While for some, the market is not open or they are not welcome, for many, the opportunities are right there. China is not easy, but why should it be? It’s tough for everyone, no matter if one is foreign or not. And no one can be sustainably successful if they don’t observe, learn and adapt. 
 LinkedIn China’s Chitu, for instance, is struggling to get market traction. Evernote, while achieving early success in China, seems to be facing some challenges for sustainable growth, mainly due to lack of premium paid users and growing competition from Chinese startups. In fact, drawing a line on “who’s Chinese and who’s not” is also somewhat artificial, given that Alibaba’s and Tencent’s largest respective shareholders are not Chinese, and some of LinkedIn China’s and Uber China’s key shareholders are Chinese. (Sequoia China, whose parent is a Silicon Valley-headquartered VC fund, has its operations led by Chinese venture capitalist Neil Shen, who has a deep understanding of the China context.)
As China’s digital business grows, it’s going to provide more opportunities for many players. Who “gets it” and who doesn’t will certainly not only be a function of “being blocked or not,” but equally (or even more importantly) those who have the right mindset and approach to the China context (and for that matter, China for the world). To this end, it’s a real test of the leadership and capabilities of the companies, as well as the capital behind them.",2016-08-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/shutterstock_325058183.jpg?w=738,"evernote,china",Can foreign tech companies win in China?
301,Jon Russell,"India-based mobile wallet startup MobiKwik has landed a $40 million strategic investment from Net1, a mobile payment firm specializing in solutions for the unbanked. Net1 has been listed on the NASDAQ since 2005 and is valued at around $480 million.
As part of the deal, South Africa-based Net1, which is also public on the Johannesburg stock exchange, will integrate its ‘virtual card’ technology into MobiKwik’s wallet app to help its 100,000 merchant partners get access to a wider selection of payments. The technology works by creating a virtual card — as the name implies — using a mobile phone as the identity in order to process transactions like a physical credit card.
“Virtual cards are used like traditional plastic credit or debit cards, except that as soon as the transaction is authorized, the generated card number expires immediately. While it has been focused primarily on card not present transactions for internet payments in our initial deployments, we have the ability to customize the software as industry acceptance increases to incorporate new trends such as presentation through NFC or Quick Response, or QR, Codes,” Net1 explains on its website.
Beyond that, Net1 also offers a payment processor system that uses biometrics, issuing services for Visa, MasterCard and UnionPay, and other payment services.
The company said it is keen to partner with MobiKwik, which claims 32 million users, in order to grow its business in India, where smartphone ownership is growing among the country’s billion-plus population.
“Our strategic investment in MobiKwik provides us with meaningful participation in one of the largest and fastest growing digital payment markets globally,” Net1 chairman and CEO Serge Belamant said in a statement.
“Over the next three years, MobiKwik has targeted having 150 million users and 500,000 merchants, and the introduction of our various technologies is expected to enhance their value proposition and differentiation to users, online and offline merchants, increase acceptance, and accelerate growth,” he added.
MobiKwik — which is rivaled by Alibaba-backed Paytm and FreeCharge, which is owned by Snapdeal, among others — counts Japan’s GMO, Mediatek, Sequoia, Cisco and American Express among its existing backers. The company has raised over $120 million to date including today’s news.

302,Jon Russell,"Uber has taken the plaudits for its audacious plan to deploy driverless cars as soon as this month, but the U.S. giant has been beaten to the punch for actually introducing autonomous vehicles by a far lower-profile company that is working on the other side of the world in Singapore.
NuTonomy, a three-year-old company that span out of MIT, announced that its first autonomous vehicles available for public hire have hit the roads of the Southeast Asian country today.
The name may not be familiar, but this development hasn’t come out of the blue. Cambridge, MA-based NuTonomy has been working with authorities in Singapore for some time as part of the country’s focus on surfacing new technology. Indeed, the Singapore Economic Development Board itself was one of a number of high-profile backers to take part in NuTonomy’s $16 million Series A financing round in May this year.
As we wrote then, the company plans to introduce a fully-autonomous “robo” taxi service by 2018. Today’s announcement is a major step towards that goal, but NuTonomy has been privately testing self-driving cars in Singapore since April. It is also conducting trials in London and Michigan, and counts Jaguar Land Rover among its partners.
Singapore is the real test bed thanks to the support of authorities in the country, who are switched on by the potential to embrace technology to reduce congestion and cars ownership.

The public trial is a world-first, but it is starting in a small, controlled environment.
Customers can use NuTonomy’s app to summon a ride for free, but it is limiting availability to a 2.5km square business district area in Singapore — “One North” — with just a handful of cars, all of which are a Renault Zoe or a Mitsubishi i-MiEV.
Like Uber, the setup does require some human presence. Each car will include a NuTonomy engineer who will “observe system performance and assume control if needed to ensure passenger comfort and safety.”
The trials are likely to be hugely impacting for NuTonomy with the data captured from public rides going towards hitting that target of a fully self-driving car fleet by 2018.
Uber CEO Travis Kalanick refused to be drawn on timeframes for when Uber will expand its self-driving car push. That’s where NuTonomy has a huge advantage in Singapore, a country that is just 720 km square with a government that pushes technology through a smart city program which includes open data, APIs and more.
“NuTonomy’s first-in-the-world public trial is a direct reflection of the level of maturity that we have achieved with our AV software system. The trial represents an extraordinary opportunity to collect feedback from riders in a real-world setting, and this feedback will give NuTonomy a unique advantage as we work toward deployment of a self-driving vehicle fleet in 2018,” NuTonomy CEO and co-founder Karl Iagnemma said in a statement.
To speed its development, Uber snapped up self-driving tech startup Otto in a rare acquisition that could be worth as much as $600 million. Given that Otto only launched publicly in May, that’s a pretty quick and enthusiastic pick-up from Uber, to say the least. It makes you wonder if Kalanick and co made efforts to acquire NuTonomy, given that knowledge of its technology has been in the public domain for some time and it has clearly made progress, too.",2016-08-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/nutonomy.jpg?w=738,"self-driving,autonomous-vehicles,self-driving-cars,singapore",MIT spinout NuTonomy just beat Uber to launch the world’s first self-driving taxi
303,Jon Russell,"Ford is continuing to invest in tech startups, this time with an emerging market twist.
Hot on the heels of a deal with a self-driving sensor technology startup, the automotive giant has backed Zoomcar, a Zipcar-like company that operates in India. Subsidiary Ford Smart Mobility led a $24 million Series B round, with participation from returning investors Sequoia Capital, Nokia Growth Partners (NGP) and Empire Angels. The company’s valuation was not disclosed.
Four-year-old Zoomcar closed an $11 million Series B round last summer following an $8 million raise in late 2014. This new round — which had been reported in Indian press as early as July — takes it to over $46 million in VC money to date.
Zoomcar is a car rental service based on successful Western models like Zipcar, which was bought by Avis for $500 million three years ago. The startup is based in Bangalore and it currently claims to offer 2,000 cars around seven of India’s tier-one cities, with 75 percent occupancy and 1.5 million app downloads. Ford was Zoomcar’s first OEM partner, and the startup said Ford provides “most” of the vehicles on its platform.
“As Ford expands its business to be both an auto and mobility company, we are pursuing a long-term vision to develop services and solutions that make it easier for consumers to move through cities using multiple modes of transportation,” Ford Asia Pacific mobility director John Larsen said in a statement.
“Our investment in Zoomcar will help strengthen the company’s role in shaping India’s developing mobility space and provide new transportation options to help make people’s lives better,” Larsen added.

Zoomcar has major plans to grow its fleet of cars rapidly, and that centers around a marketplace launched this year that is called ZAP, or Zoomcar Associate Program in full.
That’s a hybrid model that lets car owners and Zoomcar work together to make a vehicle available for lease via Zoomcar’s platform when it isn’t being used by its owner.
It’s basically an Airbnb for car ownership — although it only applies to new purchases, as laws in India forbid the sub-rental of existing cars.
Here’s how it works: Zoomcar boosts its inventory by getting access to cars without buying the assets in full. Access isn’t 100 percent, but it could mean a car is driven when the owner is at work, on vacation or simply not using it.
On the other side of the table, the setup helps car owners get a vehicle at a much lower price. First, Zoomcar matches them to dealers, insurance companies and others involved in the buying process, including favorable rates. Once the vehicle is acquired, it joins the Zoomcar fleet and the company pays the owner money when it is used.
Zoomcar claimed that ZAP participants can expect to get around a 90 percent return on their investment in a vehicle, which is pretty significant if it pans out that way. There’s also a minimum guaranteed revenue per month and provisions to “make sure that your car is kept in top shape at all times.”
The marketplace approach blows Zoomcar’s previous asset acquisition process out of the water. Not only is it saving considering sums on spending, but it has the potential to scale its fleet very rapidly.
Indeed, Zoomcar CEO and co-founder Greg Moran told TechCrunch in an interview that he expects ZAP to account for 70 to 80 percent of all cars on the platform over the next year.
It is early days, but Moran added that ZAP could make up half of Zoomcar’s vehicles as soon as the first quarter of next year. In the longer run, he said the approach can grow its total fleet more than ten-fold to 25,000 vehicles across 25 cities by 2018.
Clearly then, beyond what Zoomcar is already doing, Ford has additional interest in the company since the ZAP program is an effective means to reaching and selling to would-be car owners in India’s billion-plus population.
Might there be the potential for other collaborations?
Moran acknowledge that Ford is one of the many pioneering self-driving cars — which Uber is switching on this month in the U.S. — and other technologies, but he declined to say more on other ways they may work together.
“Autonomous vehicles are not something we’re looking at in the near term,” he explained. “With a lot of these newer initiatives there is a lot of red tap for permits etc. in India. With autonomous vehicles, there will be a whole new set of regulations and we want to get more regulatory guidance before” committing to investment and spending.
“But it’s something that we obviously think about,” Moran added. “Ford was our first partner when we launched the business, and we share the shame common values. They have a longer term view on the technology, product and financing pieces.”
International expansion is another topic for the future that isn’t a priority right now.
“India is quite an ocean,” Moran said. “Although at at some point in the next 24 months [expansion] is in the cards for us.”
When pushed for potential expansion markets, Moran mentioned “big markets in Africa” like Nigeria, or countries neighboring India in South Asia, as places where the company can tap into its expertise and business without language being a huge barrier.
Two years may seem like a while, but the Zoomcar CEO is confident that building a business in India stands Zoomcar in good stead even if others take first mover advantage.
“Those markets right now are really untapped,” he said. “Even if someone comes into the markets [now], we will have a huge advantage based on our business… [such as] data on users, historical driving behavior, payments and all these elements that put this whole piece together.”
More immediately, Moran is focused on growing Zoomcar’s reach in India’s biggest cities. Unlike rivals like ride-hailing service like Ola — which is closing in on 100 cities, and includes long-distance ride services — Zoomcar is deliberately moving slower with an “efficient growth” plan.
“We will continue to go much deeper,” he explained. “Others have blasted out to 100-plus cities and kept very a horizontal strategy, but with around 80 percent of revenue coming from five or six cities, it derails them from profitability.”
Zoomcar, while operating a different business model, is cash positive now, according to Moran.
Don’t expect Zoomcar’s 185 staff numbers to raise fast, either. The company is seeking “a select few” hires on its business team of 160, including a COO, but again it is a case of slow and steady wins in the race. In theory, at least.",2016-08-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/zoomcar.jpg?w=738,"empire-angels,sequoia-capital-india,nokia-growth-partners,ford",Ford leads $24M investment in India-based vehicle rental company Zoomcar
304,Jon Russell,"Relying on credit cards doesn’t work in Southeast Asia, where less than 10 percent of the 600 million population are estimated to own plastic. That makes alternative payments, like bank transfer or over-the-counter, critical for anyone doing business in the region, where online spending is tipped to race to $200 million in the next 10 years.
Coda Payments, one such company that helps simplify the complexity of alternative payments in the region, has raised $2 million in new funding. Existing investors GMO Global Payment Fund, Skype co-founder Toivo Annus and Golden Gate Ventures provided the capital, which takes it past $5 million raised to date.
The Singapore-based startup last raised a $2.3 million Series A back in December 2013, and it isn’t calling this round its Series B. Neil Davidson, co-founder and CEO of the company, said that it simply raised a sum deemed necessary for progress and then will go from there.
“We’re relatively capital efficient,” he explained in an interview with TechCrunch. “That lets us take the money we need to build to the next level, which probably for us means profitability, and then see where we at.”
Davidson said this funding would be used to expand into new geographies and to support more payment methods, such as subscription billing for services like music or film streaming.
Coda Payments started out focused on Indonesia in 2013, but it has since expanded to cover Southeast Asia’s six most prominent markets: Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia.
Next stop, Davidson said, is Taiwan, which will mark Coda Payment’s first foray outside of Southeast Asia. He said that other expansions are planned, but did not disclose the specifics.
Coda Payments was initially focused on enabling carrier billing, but today it goes beyond that. Davidson, who formerly worked on mobile money solutions for the GSMA, explained that the focus is facilitating payment from whatever means possible.
“We have spent the last couple of years building out a whole range of feature to handle other alternative payments to bridge the gap for customers who are online and have money to spend but don’t have a payment card,” he said.
“Bank transfers, cash payments at retail stores, mobile wallets, bitcoin, pre-paid gaming cards — we aim to assemble these payment methods into one house,” he added.
Interestingly, the company has branched out from merely enabling to fronting a consumer-facing store front — CodaShop — for certain service providers. Today, the store — which includes content from Steam, Skype and Amazon — accounts for as much as one-quarter of Coda Payment’s overall revenue, Davidson revealed.
“It will always be an important part of the mix. You will have partners who think Southeast Asia is interesting but not enough to have their own checkout etc,” he explained.
There are no plans to broaden the consumer approach, but the Coda Payments CEO did admit that there could be opportunity to do so in the future. Perhaps with a mobile wallet product.
“At some point when you aggregate enough merchants and transaction volume is high enough it does benefit users to hold balance with us,” he said. “Right now our service is asynchronous, but if users transact with Coda every day or every other day, it might make sense to top up their balance… it could happen.”
For now though, Coda Payments — which has offices in Singapore and Jakarta, and representatives in San Francisco and Hong Kong — is quietly going about aggregating and organizing the messy business of payments.
“There are mobile wallets popping up everyone, and lots of services want retailers to integrate — it’s overwhelming and probably will be for a while,” Davidson said. “We can give merchants that reassurance, our job is to keep on top of this stuff so you can focus on other things.”
The signs certainly point to promising progress with the company claiming that it processes 17,000 transactions per day.
“I think it’s an impressive figure even if you talk to the more established payment gateways,” Davidson said.",2016-08-23,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/getty_b_120710_manwallet-money.jpg?w=630,"toivo-annus,golden-gate-ventures",Coda Payments raises $2M to enable alternative online payments in Asia
305,Jon Russell,"Less than two weeks after raising a fresh round of $25 million, FullContact has opened its checkbook to snap up India-based startup Profoundis in an undisclosed deal.
Denver-based FullContact is focused on helping you manage relationships and contacts in a more orderly and intelligent fashion. The company said its newest raise would be used to fund acquisitions, although we didn’t expect one to come around quite so quickly. The decision to buy Profoundis is also notable for shining light on the fledging startup scene in Kerala, the Southern state in India that is better known for tourism, greenery and beaches than tech. (That’s not dissimilar to FullContact, which itself is not based in Silicon Valley.)
Profoundis began operations in 2012, although its founding team of four had worked unofficially together prior to that date. The company offers an intelligence service — called Vibe — that sits in your email account and surfaces information about your contacts, in much the same style as Rapportive, the plug-in that LinkedIn acquired back in 2012.

The deal will see FullContact take on all of Profoundis’ 70 staff, “most” of whom will remain at the Indian company’s base in Kochi, Kerala. Beyond integrating Vibe into FullContact’s other services, the Profoundis team will work on bringing their “human-based data research” to other parts of FullContact’s business.
That’s important given that LinkedIn, the giant in the contact management space, is close to completing a $26.2 billion acquisition from Microsoft. That union is sure to see LinkedIn lean on its parents considerable assets, particularly in the enterprise space, meaning that smaller rivals like FullContact will need to focus on differentiation to avoid being bulldozed by a revitalized LinkedIn.
This deal certainly suggests that technology is an area that FullContact is focusing on to help stand apart from LinkedIn.
The two companies had been partners for one year prior to this deal, but FullContact co-founder and CEO Bart Lorang told TechCrunch that there are grander plans for India.
“There are a lot of different types of work we can do,” he said in a phone interview. “We plan to use [Profoundis’] technology-enhanced human data research solutions to build products and services that are dramatically smarter than anything the market has seen before.”
He added that Profoundis will become FullContact’s India HQ and “scale to many thousands of staff over the next few years.”
That will involve going beyond engineering talent to bring in employees in customer support, localization and other business teams in India.
“Becoming part of the FullContact team allows us to further execute on our mission globally, and together, our users will benefit by having more detailed information about their contacts, allowing them to be even more awesome with people,” added Profoundis CEO and co-founderArjun Pillai via a blog post.
Pillai said Vibe will live on after the acquisition, after which it will “integrate directly inside of the FullContact ecosystem.”
Profoundis was part of Startup Chile and graduated the Microsoft Accelerator Program in Bangalore in 2013. It then went on to raise an undisclosed seed round one year later. FullContact, meanwhile, has raised close to $45 million from investors, which include Foundry Group, Baird Capital, Shea Ventures and Blue Note, and made four other acquisitions to date.
Speaking earlier this month after closing the latest $25 million round, Lorang hinted at impending M&A activity.
“I see a lot of distressed startups out there in our wider field unable to raise more money for sure,” he told TechCrunch.
We had assumed that would predominantly be U.S.-based deals, but Lorang told me today that he has looked at potential acquisitions in other parts of Asia, including Hong Kong and Singapore. Such moves could help grow the company’s reach and provide it more localized expertise for navigating communication culture, regulations and more worldwide, he explained.
“We see an opportunity for what we’re doing [worldwide] and we’re taking it,” he added.",2016-08-23,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/fullcontact-ios.jpg?w=738,"contact-management,india,fullcontact",FullContact expands to India with aquisition of email intelligence startup Profoundis
306,Jon Russell,"Sony will reportedly unveil two new versions of the PlayStation 4 at its upcoming New York press event on September 7.
We already know that the company is set to launch a more powerful version of the console — called ‘Neo’ — but now the Wall Street Journal is reporting that it will also refresh its standard model. There are no precise details right now, but the Journal — citing sources — said that the two different versions of the PS4 are designed to broaden the appeal and “attract hardcore fans and more casual users to its videogame platform.”
Sony has sold more than 40 million PS4 consoles, and its games are continuing to sell well, too. While it has scaled back its loss-making mobile business and suffered the financial impact of the Kumamoto earthquake on its manufacturing operations, the PlayStation business is booming. The gaming division accounted for 75 percent of Sony’s profits in its most recent Q1 2016 quarter of business such is its importance to the Japanese tech giant.
Additional games consoles aren’t the only notable new gaming development planned for Sony. The company said earlier this year that it will begin producing games for iOS and Android for the first time, following rival Nintendo’s lead, but it clarified that these titles would be focused on users based in Asia.
That’s bound to disappoint millions of ardent fans elsewhere in the world — but they can at least look forward to new versions of the PS4. And, if they are partial to nostalgia, Nintendo is rebooting its classic NES console with a miniature version just in time for Christmas.

307,Jon Russell,"India continues to be one of the rare growth markets for the global smartphone industry after it lodged a 17 percent year-on-year increase in unit shipments in the second quarter of 2016, according to a new report from IDC.
That growth came off the back of two successive quarters of shipment declines, with Q2 registering a slim 3.7 percent increase on the shipment total for Q1 2016, the research firm said. For context: worldwide smartphone sales are forecast to slow to just 3.1 percent annual growth this year.
In terms of vendors, it is very much the story that we’ve seen before in India: Samsung leads the pack, with Apple nowhere to be seen.
Samsung took 25.1 percent of all smartphone shipments during the three-month period, ahead of Micromax (12.9 percent), Lenovo (7.8 percent), Intex (7.1 percent) and Reliance Jo (6.8 percent). IDC didn’t report a figure for Apple such was its lowly position.
While Lenovo was the only Chinese vendor in the top five, IDC noted that Chinese smartphone makers as a whole are seeing their shipment numbers rise in India. That’s in contrast to global and India-based players, whose numbers shrunk year-on-year.

“China based vendors’ shipments grew 28 percent over previous quarter of which Lenovo group, Vivo, Xiaomi, OPPO and Gionee were key contributors driving the growth,” IDC analyst Karthik J said in a statement.
Not only that, but Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi shipped over 1 million devices in the quarter, matching a feat that had only been achieved in India by one Chinese phone company before: Lenovo. IDC said also that Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 3 was the top selling phone based on online sales, and the Chinese firm’s biggest seller in the quarter. Xiaomi’s progress in India runs contrast to China, where it watched Huawei overtake it at the top of the smartphone market in the last quarter.
The second and third quarters of the year are usually tough on Apple, as consumers wait on the company’s next devices which are typically unveiled in September.
Apple did indeed post a 15 percent drop in phone sales during the Q2 2016 quarter. While its new four-inch iPhone SE performed as intended in the U.S. and parts of Europe, winning Apple new marketshare, IDC’s data suggested that it didn’t do well in India.
“Apple’s iPhone SE failed to make any significant impact in the premium segment while its previous generation iPhone 5S continued to contribute majority volume,” the analyst firm said.
That’s not a huge surprise since the device’s $399 price remains high, for now, as I previously argued. For many in India, older devices like the iPhone 5S continue to represent better value for money. It is still early days though, and the iPhone SE could have an impact if and when Apple decides to lower its price. The fact remains that, on the evidence so far, the phone is making a bigger impact in the West, perhaps where its smaller form factor helps it stand out from Apple’s other devices.",2016-08-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/india-flag.jpg?w=738,"idc,india","Samsung leads India’s smartphone market, as Apple’s iPhone SE fails to take off"
308,Jon Russell,"Foodpanda, the food delivery startup backed by Rocket Internet, is selling its operations in Indonesia and evaluating its presence in the rest of Southeast Asia as part of a push towards profitability.
Multiple sources close to the company told TechCrunch that its business in Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most populous country, is available to potential acquirers for less than $1 million — and an all-cash deal isn’t even a requirement. Foodpanda, which is active in 500 cities across five continents worldwide, has slashed the asking price for its Indonesia operations to basically zero after more than a year of unsuccessfully trying to offload it, one source added.
The intention mirrors the sale of its business in Vietnam last year. The company reportedly tried to offload its India business earlier this year without success.
Foodpanda provided the following statement which, if you strip out the grandiose terms, does hint at transactional activity up ahead:
Indonesia may be Southeast Asia’s largest economy but it has proven to be a challenge due to factors including competition and local market conditions. Go-Jek, a motorbike taxi-on demand company that this month raised $550 million, is the primary thorn in Foodpanda’s side. The company offers food delivery as one of its many services, and it is able to price that business competitively thanks to its massive fleet of 200,000 drivers and revenue from other services. Grab also offers services like food delivery, while Uber is tipped to follow suit.
One source close to Foodpanda added that Jakarta’s challenging traffic congestion and a lack of infrastructure have added complexities.
Foodpanda is actively seeking to cash out of Indonesia, but that may not be its only exit from Southeast Asia. TechCrunch understands from a source that the company is reevaluating its entire business across the region, and it has already made tentative efforts to sell in some countries. The company expanded in Asia via a series of acquisitions, which, in many cases, ironically leaves it without obvious suitors.
News of its reassessment of Southeast Asia comes just weeks after Foodpanda co-founder and CEO Ralf Wenzel claimed that the company is profitable in two of its markets — Europe and the Middle East — but not Asia.
Wenzel told Reuters his company is “focused on improving market share” in Asia, which has included asset exchanges with competitors, in order to turn its finances positive there.
“Over the next couple of months we will turn break-even and then profitable in the first Southeast Asian countries,” Wenzel added.
While the Foodpanda CEO claimed profitability in Asia is “just a matter of scale,” our sources said that discarding under-performing units — which Wenzel did not mention — is a very key part of the plan.
Foodpanda raised $210 million last year — including a $100 million injection from Goldman Sachs and a separate $110 million round — but the climate for investment is tougher now. One source close to Rocket Internet told us that the venture builder is not optimistic about landing capital for many of its older, more capital-intensive businesses, including Foodpanda.
That’s evidenced by a recent round of capital for Global Fashion Group (GFG), a collection of Rocket Internet-backed fashion marketplaces worldwide. GFG raised $330 million but the capital came from a collection of trusted Rocket Internet entities and at a huge mark down. The group’s valuation plummeted from $3.4 billion at its last raise to $1.1 billion.
Sources speaking at the time told us that GFG CEO Romain Voog met with more than 90 investors, but came home empty-handed.
GFG had already preempted that challenge by discarding some of its unprofitable business units in Southeast Asia — does that sound familiar?! — which included the sale of Zalora Thailand and Zalora Vietnam for low prices and triggered high-level execs to leave. Rocket Internet isn’t alone to struggle in Southeast Asia, though. Groupon sold its Indonesia business to fitness membership startup KFit, a fairly unorthodox acquirer, after it had already exited other Asian markets.
Now it looks like Foodpanda is following a similar approach. While Southeast Asia is often noted for its 600 million cumulative population and growth potential, today its nascent digital economy is challenging for many online retail companies.
This year has marked a different approach for Rocket Internet in Asia. This summer, it finally offloaded Jabong, its fashion marketplace in India, to rival Myntra in a $70 million deal this summer, while Alibaba bought a majority stake in Amazon-like Lazada for $1 billion in April. Despite a seemingly decent outcome on the face of it, many Lazada investors were left disappointed, and the company itself ran out of money thanks to spiraling loses.",2016-08-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/a73995062cdd13d91870b70671ecd3e5e64987b3eb57164bdcpimgpsh_fullsize_distr.jpg?w=738,"food-delivery,rocket-internet,indonesia,foodpanda",Foodpanda is selling its Indonesia business and rethinking the rest of Southeast Asia

Since Mobvoi operates a dedicated app store for its OS, it expects this list to grow as more developers make their services available for the Ticwatch 2.
Many backers had also asked about warranty status for the device even though — as we’ve stressed many times — backing a Kickstarter is not the same as buying a product. Backers must make concessions for backing an idea and accept that, in some circumstances, there may be unforeseen issues.
Nonetheless, Mobvoi has pledged it offer a one-year warranty:
The update was well received by most backers. The project has now passed $1.5 million with six more days left for others to join.
As a reminder, we were impressed by the original Mandarin version of the watch, which features a more intuitive user interface than other watches, some nifty gestures and integrations with China’s top services — such as ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing.
The Ticwatch 2 is Mobvoi’s first effort at making an international version of the watch. Mobvoi co-founder Yuanyuan Li told us last month that the Kickstarter edition is very much a beta version which the company hopes to refine and improve with feedback from its community of backers.",2016-08-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/screen-shot-2016-07-29-at-11-41-39-am.png?w=738,"mobvoi,ticwatch",Ticwatch 2 team clarifies which apps its Kickstarter smartwatch will initially support
310,Jon Russell,"Rakuten has confirmed that it has acquired the assets of Bitnet, a bitcoin wallet startup it invested in, which will be used to create a ‘blockchain lab’ for the Japanese retail giant.
The transaction is undisclosed but it follows a Wall Street Journal report in July which speculated that a deal was in the works. Rakuten took part in a $14.5 million investment round for Bitnet nearly two years ago, which was led by Highland Capital Partners.
Rakuten integrated Belfast-based Bitnet’s payment option into some of its online commerce sites last summer. Bitnet was supposed to rival bitcoin payment heavyweights Coinbase and Bitpay, but after a spate of executives left and the startup reportedly laid off half of its staff to cut costs, it struggled to grow its business. That led to this strategic asset-stripping move from Rakuten.
The Japanese e-commerce giant is taking Bitnet’s IP and “assets” and two of the startup’s key personnel to create a Belfast-located research facility to explore the potential of the blockchain. That makes a lot of sense given Rakuten’s empire of e-commerce websites and banking services in Japan and elsewhere in the world.
Bitnet CTO Stephen McNamara and former VP of Engineering Fergal Down have come on board to helm the lab which “will be a dedicated research and development organization within Rakuten, focused on blockchain technology and its potential applications in the fintech and e-commerce sectors,” the company said.
“Drawing on the significant IP assets and deep engineering expertise of the Bitnet team and combining that with Rakuten’s leadership in fintech and support of innovative solutions, the new Rakuten Blockchain Lab will be our first step toward unlocking blockchain’s potential to revolutionize the way that financial and e-commerce transactions are conducted,” Yasufumi Hirai, who leads Rakuten’s technology division, added via a prepared statement.",2016-08-18,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/a-real-bitcoin.jpg?w=738,"blockchain,bitnet,rakuten",Rakuten buys struggling bitcoin startup Bitnet to create a ‘blockchain research lab’
311,Jon Russell,"Many have speculated that India is the next battleground for Uber after it agreed to sell its China business last month, and the U.S. company hasn’t wasted time in increasing its focus on the country after it launched two new features that, while subtle, could help it capture a larger slice of the market.
Uber today announced that users in India can now book rides for other people, while it has also introduced a mobile web booking option for ride-hailing without the need for its app. Both features are live in India only, an Uber representative clarified to TechCrunch. Uber indicated that it may look to expand them to other markets in the future.
Requesting rides for other people is actually an extension of an existing service that allows hotels and other businesses to book cars on the service for guests — “Uber Central”. It could be a useful option in India for those who want to arrange transportation for family members, significant others, or anyone who may be less tech savvy or unaware of the ride-railing service.
It works just like a regular Uber booking, except that you drop the pin for collection at the other person’s location — obviously — after which the app prompts you to share their contact details via their entry in your phone’s address book. You also select a payment type, which includes cash if your generosity doesn’t extend to covering the other person’s fare.

Once booked, the passenger receives a text message with the trip details, including a URL to track the driver who is on route to collect them.
The second new feature is Uber’s web booking platform, which is located at dial.uber.com and it is also an India-only play for now.
The process is pretty straight forward as Uber explained in a blog post:
This could be a neat alternative for first time Uber users, perhaps those with a basic smartphone, limited storage on their device (and therefore limited space for apps) or just someone who is taking a tentative first look at an Uber ride.
The fact that it is focused on UberGo, the company’s budget ride category in India, and takes cash for payment is indicative that it is focused on going beyond the core Uber audience and into the mass market.
Obviously having users download your app is the primary goal for any company since that helps keep engagement high and bookings regular, but offering an alternative is necessary to cover the bases.
Ola, the company that is leading Uber in India, has long offered a web-based booking option and a hotline for taking requests over the phone. Uber doesn’t do the latter, but it is certainly widening its options to reach as many potential customers as possible.
Uber is reported to have redeployed 150 engineers across India and Southeast Asia in a bid to rival Ola and Grab, its local enemies in those respective markets. (It created a dedicated engineering team in India earlier this year.) It has also bolstered its Indian business with a number of high-profile hires. No doubt these features are just the first of many for both India and Southeast Asia as the global ride-hailing giant gets serious about winning these two emerging markets.",2016-08-18,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/uber-web-platform.png?w=738,"ride-hailing,india",Uber ups its focus on India with new booking options exclusive to the country
312,Jon Russell,"WhatsApp may have over one billion active users each month but it continues to frustrate the many small businesses that rely on it for sales but suffer for its lack of advanced features.
Messaging services like Line, WeChat and even Facebook Messenger have become platforms that let business users get dedicated usernames and accounts, manage group chats, set up stores and use bots for communication, all while WhatsApp remains basic. The company only added a web-based interface last year, for example. Prior to that, businesses tapping into its popularity had to literally key in all updates on a phone. That doesn’t scale when dealing with hundreds of potential customers.
The problem is particularly acute in India, where WhatsApp is estimated to have over 100 million users. As the country’s most popular app, WhatsApp is unparalleled as a distribution channel for selling online or retaining customers, despite being largely ill-suited to the role. That’s where Meesho, a startup in Y Combinator’s latest batch, is hoping to change things and empower WhatsApp sellers.
The company is a ‘Shopify for mobile’ for India at the most basic level, Meesho co-founder Vidit Aatrey told me in an interview. Essentially, it adds commerce features to WhatsApp to allow businesses to engage with customers and sell product more efficiently.
“Small businesses in India use WhatsApp groups a lot, posting details of their products daily, and then using cash or bank transfer to collect payment” Aatrey explained.
“But the whole model has many challenges, especially for the buyer who can’t search, while the seller can’t categorize products. If you’re looking for a sari, for example, you need to keep scrolling through chats — but there are hundreds of photos [in a group] per day — customers are spammed to hell, photos get downloaded to their device so they need to clean their phone regularly, and there is no [formalized] way to collect payment.”
Given that Facebook, the company that owns WhatsApp, is testing social commerce solutions of its own, Meesho has identified a genuine problem here.

Meesho aims to soothe some of the WhatsApp commerce pain points by moving much of the buying experience to its dedicated mobile shopping app.
There, customers can browser ‘carousels’ of product, ask questions to the buyer, and make an online payment via a clickable URL if they prefer that to cash or bank transfer. (That’s powered by Razorpay, a fellow YC graduate from India that we wrote about last year.)
Beyond the transaction itself, Meesho also alerts sellers when potential customers are viewing their store on the platform — giving them a chance to interact — while it condenses new product listing alerts into one message per day which is sent via a Facebook Messenger bot. Yes, that is yet another app, but it removes the irritating WhatsApp spam — since only a fraction of products are relevant to a customer — and could deliver a more qualitative interaction and, ultimately, sales.
Meesho and Messenger are also important mechanisms for outreach, too, Aatrey said.
“Facebook is generally used by small businesses for customer acquisition, but they do not keep their customers there because they can’t push messages to all users,” he explained. “If 100 people like a Page, for example, maybe 10 will see each message in their Timeline.”
That’s important given that small businesses in India which Meesho targets don’t tend to invest money in Facebook ads, boosting their posts or pretty much any marketing activity at all.
Aatrey said the sign-up process is easy, deliberately so because Meesho is working with people who may not be particularly tech savvy. Retailers simply provide a Facebook page URL, which the service uses to pull product info and images and create a Meesho shop automagically.
Meesho claims over 1,000 businesses on its platform right now but it is not monetizing its service at this point. Aatrey said there are no plans to make money at this point, but his current thinking is that, when the time is right, Meesho will take a commission from sales it helps facilitate. That again ties back to a reluctance to spend on the marketing side.
The company raised an undisclosed seed round last year which, in addition to the money it took for its place at Y Combinator, gives it sufficient capital to “sustain ourselves for a long time,” according to Aatrey.
That makes YC demo day, one of the premier gatherings of investors worldwide, a less pressured situation.
“We had raised before YC, so we have money,” Aatrey said. “If something good comes our way that’s fine, but it isn’t like we need to raise.”
Following the end of the YC batch, Aatrey and fellow co-founder Sanjeev Barnwal will head back to India to rejoin the six other people on the Bangalore-based team. Meesho is planning a number of updates, which will eventually include discoverability options to enable customers inside one store to find products from other Meesho-powered retailers.
While he admitted that being in the U.S. is a challenge since his business runs on India time, Aatrey highly recommended other Indian founders to consider a stint at YC.
“We have learned to talk to our users better and understand their needs,” he said of the program. “YC helps you learn a few habits that are important, for example focusing on one thing at a time and talking to customers every day. When you start doing that, you’ll see positive results.”
“For someone who hasn’t worked in U.S., I’d definitely recommend YC — even if they need to be in India for operations,” he added.",2016-08-17,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/meesho_yc_pic.jpeg?w=738,"commerce,india",Meesho wants to make selling through WhatsApp more efficient and less painful
313,Jon Russell,"Ola, the company battling Uber in India, has confirmed today that it has shut down TaxiForSure, a rival it acquired for $200 million last year, after it integrated its services.
Economic Times reported today that Ola shuttered TaxiForSure, shedding at least 700 jobs in the process, but a source close to Ola told TechCrunch that the figure is around 300. TaxiForSure, which was focused on budget rides, had 1,700 staff at the time it was purchased, but many, including its former CEO, have long since departed.
While it didn’t reveal how many staff have been let go, Ola said in a statement that it would offer benefits for “positions that cease to exist as a result of this transition.”
“With all TaxiForSure driver-partners and customers coming on board the Ola app, the integration is now complete,” Ola said.
“As part of this integration over the last 18 months, we have achieved immense operational efficiencies, that have resulted in an improved experience for customers and driver-partners alike. In the course of the integration, we have absorbed as many TFS employees for open roles in Ola to support our growth,” the statement read.
An integration of TaxiForSure was always inevitable, but Ola never went public with its plans after buying the company. Back last summer when TaxiForSure services were first integrated into the Ola app, Ola told us that the TaxiForSure service had a future and that it would leverage both apps to increase their respective userbases.
There could, of course, be an ulterior motive at play here. Uber is increasing its focus on India — and Southeast Asia — following the sale of its business in China. Ola has been rumored to be fundraising since June — before Uber exited China — and now that its deep-pocketed rival is doubling down on India, Ola may be taking a look at its own operations more closely and making changes to remain more competitive and, crucially, more capital efficient. In that respect, migrating TaxiForSure’s primary assets — drivers, customers and some staff — makes more sense than keeping two companies going. Mint’s report suggested the integration and closure of TaxiForeSure will save Ola around $4.5 million per month.
It isn’t doom and gloom for Ola necessarily. While Uber is expected to increase the competition, most data points suggest Ola is leading the U.S.-based firm in India.
Ola got an earlier start on the market by launching its service before Uber arrived in August 2013, and its lead may also be down to the sheer breadth of services that it offers. Earlier this year, Ola — which counts SoftBank among its investors — claimed that its ‘Micro’ vehicle service alone is bigger than Uber, covering 75 cities and over a million daily rides.",2016-08-17,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/ola-tfs.jpg?w=620,"india,taxiforsure,ola","Ola confirms it has shut down TaxiForSure, the rival it acquired for $200M"
314,Romain Dillet,"Apple CEO Tim Cook is currently visiting China. According to Reuters, he used this opportunity to announce that the company would build a new research & development center in China before the end of the year.
Other than that, we don’t know much. It’s unclear what engineers in China will work on, but it’s safe to say that they might be better positioned to work on Chinese standards, such as weird wireless technology standards. The team would be well-located to work on hardware projects as well.
This news comes a couple of months after a Beijing court had some issues with the iPhone 6’s design, saying that it looks too similar to other Chinese phones. At the same time, sales have been slowing down dramatically in China. While China is still a major market for Apple, slowing economic growth combined with increased competition with Chinese OEMs are warning signs for Apple.
Following today’s announcement of a new R&D center, Apple will have a foot on the ground in China and will also tap into new talent. Many great electronics engineers are now based in Shenzhen.
This isn’t the first R&D center outside of the U.S. for Apple. The company also has teams in France, Israel, the U.K., Japan and Sweden.

315,Jon Russell,"Bugs be gone! That’s the philosophy behind Appknox, a mobile security startup from Singapore which has raised $640,000 in a pre-Series A funding round.
The deal is particularly notable since it is the first public investment from SeedPlus, a new fund from Singapore’s Jungle Ventures which is focused on early-stage deals. SeedPlus was announced in May and is run by executives hired from Spotify, Evernote and SingTel-backed streaming service HOOQ.
Formed by a trio of bug bounty hunters, Appknox has been around since 2014 but it only released its service one year ago. The company graduated the JFDI Asia accelerator program in Singapore in 2014 and later the Microsoft Accelerator in Bangalore, but this is the first time it has raised any formal capital.
The company offers a software platform that is designed to help developers and startups easily spot vulnerabilities within their software and apps. Developers simply load their apps into the backend — just dropping an App Store or Google Play URL is enough — and it is then run on cloud-based emulator to stress test vulnerabilities.
The level of service ranges from a set of standard-level checks, which can run inside 10 minutes, to deeper probing using both algorithms and human prying. Pricing is upwards of $799 per month depending on requirements.
“The objective is to help developers and companies identify and fix security problems without being experts. Most companies don’t have a dedicated security team, and in those that do there can be tension between developers and security teams,” Prateek Panda, Appknox co-founder and CMO, told TechCrunch in an interview.
“We can reduce security testing times from two weeks to a few days,” Panda added. “In less than 10 mins, developers can get details on a lot of automated test cases, so by the time you go out and grab a coffee there are some test cases to look at. But we will never do away with [the] human part… human testing makes sure an app is fully secured.”
The company initially targeted the market in India after finding a product fit while in the Microsoft program. While it counts “almost all the major e-commerce and payments” companies in the country among its roster of 70-plus clients — which includes BigBasket, Redmart and HOOQ — Panda said that the lack of interest in security from the Indian tech community triggered a refocus on Singapore.
“In the mobile security space, India is not a hot market, Singapore is far more mature —  businesses take security much more seriously,” he explained. “We’re helping set up operations and explore the market in Southeast Asia, we’re look forward to spending more time and money on deeper analysis and systems.”
Appknox started out as a team of three hackers, but today it has 22 staff who are mainly based in India. Panda said the company is working to raise a Series A round in the next 6-8 months.
He admits that security-as-a-service isn’t particularly well known in Southeast Asia, but the team draws inspiration from U.S.-based companies like Veracode, which has raised over $110 million from investors and is tipped to go public in the near future having abandoned a listing last year. Veracode has been around for more than a decade, but Panda said Appknox has already nabbed some of its clients to outline its potential.
He added that Appknox is keen to establish a U.S. testing base in the future, but for now it is in talks to build relationships with universities in the U.S. and Singapore to help tap into new talent.
The founders may not have time to chase bug bounties anymore, but it is positively encouraged among staff. One of their most significant finds to date was a vulnerability inside Indian Uber rival Ola, unearthed in February.
“We know so many ways to buy free ticket, free cabs, free food, etc,” Panda joked — but you suspect that there is a lot of truth behind that.",2016-08-16,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/money-cash-money-cash.jpg?w=738,"security,jungle-ventures,seedplus,appknox",Mobile security startup Appknox lands funding to focus on Southeast Asia
316,Jon Russell,"Alibaba saw record growth in Q2 2016 as the company’s Chinese retail marketplaces surged and users on mobile out spent those on desktop devices for the first time.
The e-commerce giant reported revenue of RMB 32.2 billion (US$4.8 billion), which is a 59 percent increase year-on-year — the highest growth since Alibaba went public in September 2014 in the largest U.S. IPO in history.
There’s been talk of an economic slowdown in China, but that didn’t seem to impact Alibaba’s business on home soil. The company’s China marketplaces pulled in total sales of RMB 23.4 billion (US$3.5 billion), 49 percent higher than the same time last year. Of that figure, 75 percent of revenue came from mobile devices — RMB 17.5 billion (US$2.6 billion) — which is up 119 percent year-over-year.
Mobile revenue outstripped desktop for Alibaba’s Chinese marketplaces last year, but now the scale has finally tipped to mobile across its entire business with average spend higher from users on mobile than those accessing Alibaba via a PC. Handling the switch to mobile was a critical concern for investors prior to the IPO, and Alibaba executives admitted that the speed of this shift has surprised even them.
While revenue growth was undoubtedly the highlight for Alibaba executives, the company’s net income dropped 76 percent year-on-year to RMB 7,142 million, $1.1 billion, thanks to a one-off gain from its Alibaba Pictures affiliate last year. Other metrics were impressive with non-GAAP net income up 28 percent over the same period, and operating profit rising by 71 percent.
Outside of its core business, cloud computing is an area where Alibaba has been piling resources. Its Alicloud business more than doubled its revenue year-on-year to reach RMB 1.2 billion, or around $181 million, for the quarter with 577,000 paying customers.
That business is still a work in progress, though. Alicloud carded an improved RMB 439 million ($66 million) operating loss for the quarter and, speaking on an analyst call, Alibaba Vice President Joe Tsai said it is “moving towards breakeven.”
Alibaba has come under fire for not making its financial data clear enough, with the SEC investigating its accounting of affiliates like logistics firm Cainao, online-to-offline platform Koubei, video platform Youku Tudou, and Ant Financial.
In response, Alibaba broke out increased financial data — including revenue and profit/loss — for business units like such as digital media, cloud computing, food delivery and more for the first time.
For now, those affiliates are burning cash — per the chart below — but Alibaba is betting that they will supplement its core business in the future.

Alibaba is making another major bet on emerging markets.
It took a majority stake in Lazada, a Rocket Internet-backed e-commerce site in Southeast Asia, for $1 billion earlier this year, and in India it has backed mobile wallet-commerce company Paytm, as well as e-commerce unicorn Snapdeal.
“We’re starting to serve local consumers in Southeast Asia, a market with over 500 million potential consumers,” Tsai said. “That’s going to be a very important potential market for us.”
“We’ve decided to place some very strategic assets” in India, he added. “We think mobile and payments are going to be an important strategy for us there.”

317,Natasha Lomas,"Jibo, a cutesy social robot pitched to crowdfunders in mid 2014 as ‘the world’s first social robot’ but since delayed and yet to arrive in the market some nine months after its original due date, is now only going to ship to backers in the U.S. and Canada.
Overseas pre-orderers from the 45 other countries — where Jibo was originally slated as being available — have now been told they will be refunded (spotted earlier by Robotics Trends).
In the email update to its international backers Jibo writes: “After exploring all the options, we have come to the conclusion that we will not be able to deliver Jibo to your country”, adding this is because the bot “won’t function up to our standards in your country”.
So this social-robot-in-the-making is already losing friends and alienating people and it hasn’t even started shipped yet…
In an accompanying FAQ on the change Jibo’s makers claim the problems with delivering the robot to international buyers as down to latency issues on account of its servers being located in the US. They also blame issues with voice-recognition understanding “accented English”.
Interestingly they also point to “rapidly changing consumer-privacy laws” in countries outside the US as complicating the delivery of personal data services from US-based servers. Since starting work on Jibo the EU has seen various shifts in its privacy legislation landscape, with Safe Harbor nixed and now replaced by the EU-US Privacy Shield; while the region has also updated its GDPR directive — due to come into force in 2018.
But as TechCrunch pointed out when we first covered Jibo in 2014, a social robot that’s intended to be operated in people’s homes — and comes equipped with facial and voice recognition software plus a camera, microphone and video recording capabilities — presents very obvious privacy challenges. So you really have to wonder why Jibo’s makers didn’t consider data protection compliance issues prior to offering the robot in so many international markets…
They go on to write that the “right answer” to delivering Jibo to international buyers is a “fully localized” version of the robot, with servers located in the corresponding country. However they’re not making any clear commitments on that front at this point, saying only that “we plan to expand to some international markets in late 2017”.
Jibo’s slick Indiegogo pitch for pre-orders generated huge interest, pulling in more than $3.7 million in pledges for the startup, although the crowdfunding platform is notable for not requiring that project creators have a working prototype — meaning a slick marketing video can be just that: a slick marketing video and nothing more.
Jibo’s crowdfunder was quickly followed by an avalanche of investor cash — with the team closing a $25.3M Series A round in January 2015, led by RRE Ventures, followed by an $11M extension from a clutch of Asian investors to focus on delivering Jibo to Taiwan, Japan, Korea and China. So it’s perhaps most likely that those are the international markets Jibo’s makers are still hoping to serve down the line.
The full list of international markets Jibo was previously slated as available in was: the EU (all 28 countries), Norway, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru & Mexico.

318,Jordan Crook,"There are plenty of apps and services out there that tell you which restaurants you should check out. But very few of them pay much attention to the meal itself.
That’s where Wine n Dine comes in.
Wine n Dine is an Instagram-style app that lets you follow other users in your area to see which meals they’re eating, and potentially take them up on their recommendation. If you see something you like, you can simply click the “Wanna Try” button to save that meal in your inventory.
“We found that people don’t really want to take the time or energy to post about something they didn’t like,” said co-founder Adam Cooper. “Because of this, Wine n Dine offers a much more positive experience than other restaurant review apps.”
Users posting their meals to the app can rate them between one and five stars, but the vast majority of the content on the app has a rating between four and five stars.
Users can follow their friends, or follow other users in their city. Eventually, the team has plans to let you follow certain kinds of meals — imagine a pasta lover automatically seeing every amazing lasagna in the city — so that they can customize your feed based on your food tastes.
Wine n Dine soft launched last year and picked up some unexpected traction. The app now covers 70,000 restaurants and is being used in more than 6,000 cities.
The company has also raised $2.5 million in seed funding, led by Jordache Ventures, The Chetrit Group and Carmelo Anthony’s Melo7 Tech Partners.

319,Matthew Lynley,"Figuring out public transportation can be a difficult experience — a lot of the data exists in disparate spots on the internet, and there are a lot of apps trying to jockey for a spot on your phone. Amid all that, there’s of course the opportunity to simply use Google Maps to find the right timing and pathway to get to your destination.
Then there’s Moovit, a public-transit-tracking app that has been trying to get a spot on phone owners’ home screens since it launched in 2011. The company says it has 45 million users, and with a new update to the way the app looks and feels today, it’s hoping it can not only hold onto those users but attract new ones — especially as it moves into new countries.
“One thing that I learned, end of the day if you’re not really solving a true problem and a big problem, there’s a big risk that users are simply gonna maybe download the app because the experience might be nice and maybe win some design awards, but it doesn’t stick because it doesn’t provide users an ongoing value,” VP of product Yovav Meydad said. “Public transportation is relevant for billions of people around the world, and the market size is enormous.”
The app has essentially been distilled down into three different parts of the experience that ended up on a new navigation bar at the bottom: planning a trip, looking up stations and tracking commute lines. Each of these more or less represent a specific mode in a user’s movement throughout the day using public transportation, Meydad said. The company has also added new features to correct existing information if it’s changed, as well as crowdsource new data, he said.

“For an app like ours, providing users a similar experience inside the app to what they see in reality, that’s what’s most important,” Meydad said.
A lot of applications will rely on publicly available data — like the kind of information that’s released by NextBus in San Francisco — and, to be sure, Moovit does the same. But it also heavily relies on crowdsourced data, such as figuring out updated bus stops in the case of construction or having up-to-date photos. That’s geared toward making sure users have the best-possible estimates for arrival time and transit to where they’re trying to go.
The app went through a series of iterations, as well, before launching. Meydad basically stuck his team on building individual versions that would maximize each part of the experience before finding all the right data and combining everything into a core application that would convince users to engage in it in multiple different ways, he said.
“Imagine an app that had just one screen, no taps at all, directions lines and stations — think of it as Moovit for dummies, or something like an on-boarding,” Meydad said. “It was kind of radically different in its design, eventually it didn’t make it because we showed the engagement rates in this design was not as high. It was eliminating a lot of alternative design based not just on our own feeling but on tens of thousands of users over a period of four months, picking eventually, the ones that performed best.”
To be sure, Moovit is not a new entry into keeping commuters informed. The app, which started in Israel, has 45 million users and most recently raised $50 million in financing. It’s expanded into dozens of countries and continues to localize into new ones, which involves figuring out how to bring in all the right transit information and sorting it out based on where you are in the world.
While the experience has been simplified, it’s still going to have to deal with a lot of competition, both from the likes of Citymapper and new entries like Transit. Moovit tries to peg itself as a sort of Waze-like experience by relying on crowdsourced data, but it’s going to have to do two things to get that done: get people using the app, and get them to contribute data.
And of course, there’s always the opportunity to simply type in your destination with Google Maps. But for Moovit — and other apps — the goal is to not only help plan trips but also simply keep users informed with basic information that they already need. Users might simply need an arrival time because they know where they’re trying to go. Meydad’s hope is that by distilling the service into a few key experiences and making them easily accessible, Moovit will provide some kind of differentiated experience from Google Maps that merits being a completely separate app.",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-03-at-9-20-56-pm.png?w=738,"moovit,transit",Moovit tries to streamline the commute experience with an updated transit app
320,Lora Kolodny,"A tech nonprofit called CommonLit won a $3.89 million grant from the Department of Education to develop software and content that helps students read well enough to graduate from high school and succeed in their careers or college.
The grant was part of a $26 million initiative by the DOE to support libraries and nonprofits with innovative approaches to literacy.
Here’s how CommonLit works: Educators or families can set up an account and give students a code to log into CommonLit.org. There, students get reading assignments and quizzes that adapt to their reading levels over time.
Teachers can track the progress of a class or individual learner, grade their work and see where they are most challenged.
Content for CommonLit lessons is donated by publishers and authors, and encompasses short works or passages from fiction, non-fiction and poetry.
Contributors to CommonLit have included individual authors like Rita Dove, Billy Collins, Amy Tan and Gary Soto, and institutions like the Society for Science and the Public, NPR and the Digital Public Library of America.
Plenty of other edtech companies offer schools and learners from grades 5 through 12 tools to develop and test their reading skills.
Companies on this mission include large educational publishers like McGraw-Hill, with its Learn Smart and Smart Book programs, Renaissance Learning’s Accelerated Reader platform and venture-backed startups like Newsela or ActivelyLearn, to name just a few.
But what’s different about CommonLit, said chief executive and founder Michelle Brown, is that it makes its software and content completely free to schools, families and students that want to use it.
And CommonLit allows users to print materials, which matters most to students who simply don’t have enough computer or smartphone time to complete all their reading assignments online.
According to Education Superhighway, an organization that studies internet availability and speeds in U.S. schools, 21 million students in the U.S. lack access to high-speed internet.
Founded in 2013, CommonLit also focuses its outreach on schools with the greatest need, but least in financial resources to help students improve their reading mastery. Obviously, for-profit companies like those listed above have to generate profits, so cannot solely focus on schools and students of the greatest need.
Asked whether for-profit companies were seen as competitors, especially those offering “freemium” access to their platforms — where some curriculum and software features are available at zero cost to teachers or end users — Brown said no.
She noted that freemium is a good business model for many, but can contribute to what’s called “the digital divide,” where low-income students and their educational development suffers because they do not have access to tools, from tablets and PCs to individual apps, that are equivalent to those used by peers in wealthier schools or communities.
“We didn’t want to put the best parts of our product behind a paywall. Our goal was to develop a product that promotes higher-order literacy skill, and make it freely accessible so that even teachers in high-needs schools could adopt it,” Brown said.
As of the last week of September, Brown reports, CommonLit had 22,689 registered non-student users, namely teachers, in more than 12,000 schools.
Brown said she intends to use the grant funding over the next two years for hiring, to nearly triple the size of the CommonLit library and to develop year-long planning tools for teachers and a mobile app that works well for schools that have a bring-your-own-device policy.

321,Lora Kolodny,"Ontario tech firm Clearpath Robotics has raised $30 million in a Series B round of venture funding to scale up production of its self-driving vehicles.
They’re not exactly Teslas or Google self-driving cars. Intsead, Clearpath makes vehicles that autonomously move boxes and pallets around factories, warehouses and distribution centers.
Clearpath CEO and co-founder Matt Rendall tells TechCrunch, “Boxes and pallets moving around the world in the global supply chain are the circulatory system for global commerce. We believe if we can move them more efficiently we can do profound things for the economy.”
Founded in 2008, originally as a computer vision and robotics engineering consultancy, Clearpath today employs 150 full-time in Kitchener. It intends to use a portion of its new funding for hiring in sales, marketing and customer support — staff the company will need to serve larger customers.
Automotive factories are already using Clearpath’s OTTO self-driving vehicles for what’s called “line side delivery;” that is, to move parts to the appropriate personnel at their workstations, just in time for rapid installations and assembly.
Clearpath’s OTTO robots employ LiDAR and other sensors to perceive the path they need to travel and avoid collisions with people and other objects in factory and warehouse environments. The devices are operated behind a company’s firewall, as security poses a huge concern for most manufacturers, Rendall notes.
When an OTTO is running low on fuel, it returns itself to a charging or fueling station. And if the network goes down at a given facility, the OTTO can complete a certain number of tasks that have already been assigned to it, safely, before pausing to await new directions.
The Series B funding will help Clearpath develop software that can differentiate its robots in the world of materials handling, and to develop new robots sized and equipped for different jobs, Rendall said.
INovia Capital led the Series B, joined by Caterpillar Ventures, GE Ventures, Eclipse Ventures, RRE Ventures and Silicon Valley Bank.
A partner with iNovia Capital, Karam Nijjar said part of the company’s genius is its focus on vehicles that are used indoors, i.e. in controlled environments.
The makers of self-driving cars like Google, Tesla and Uber are just testing their fully autonomous systems. And regulators are still figuring out how to safely incorporate autonomous vehicles on U.S. roadways.
Meanwhile, Clearpath has been able to score large clients like GE and John Deere, and attain safety ratings for its OTTO vehicles.
Clearpath is following in the footsteps of Kiva Systems Inc., which Amazon acquired for $775 million in 2012, and turned into its Amazon Robotics division.
It competes with other companies making autonomous vehicles for materials handling, including Fetch Robotics, Seegrid and ADAM Robots.
Nijjar added, “We’ve all seen what Foxconn has been able to do with automation. The next phase for Clearpath will be about proving their value, in terms of cost savings, to clients in one of their factories in order to roll out to another five, ten or all of their factories.”
Long-term, the investor sees the potential of Clearpath Robotics to integrate its software with vehicles or robots made by other manufacturers.
For example, some of the intelligence that Clearpath has developed to move OTTO around a warehouse could work in shuttles that get people around an airport, or, contrastingly, in the mining industry, where multi-ton trucks are used to move iron, stone and other heavy loads around an outdoor but relatively controlled environment, Nijjam said.
The new funding round brings Clearpath’s total equity funding to about $41.5 million.",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/clearpath_otto_1500_warehouse.jpg?w=738,"self-driving-vehicles,series-b-funding,autonomous-vehicles",Clearpath Robotics raises $30 million to become a Tesla for the factory floor
322,Steve O'Hear,"Have we reached peak gig economy yet? Probably not, but when a startup calling itself Gig launches, we are definitely making headway. The London-based company offers a platform targeting millennials who want to pick up shift work in the hospitality and retail sectors.
As well as enabling you to find and book work through the app, Gig’s headline feature is that once a shift is completed, workers automatically get paid within 24 hours.
If the so-called gig economy is fueling an array of services that let consumers purchase things “on-demand,” here Gig is punting employment itself as available on-demand.
“Millennials want instant gratification, they want and get it with travel (Uber), takeaway (Deliveroo) and retail (Amazon same day delivery), but they are yet to get it with work,” says Gig co-founder Antony Woodcock.
“Employment is traditionally the embodiment of all things contrary to the above. It’s structured, you work set shifts or set days, which are planned a week or more in advance and you don’t get paid until the end of the week or month. There isn’t anything instant about that.”
In contrast, there’s no obligation to work a minimum number of days or a minimum number of hours when you sign up to Gig. You simply apply for the shifts that work for you, presuming they are available. “Gig provides instant gratification by paying advances to its users 24 hours after the completion of their shift,” explains Woodcock.
He and his brother Daniel came up with the idea for Gig after they found it difficult to efficiently staff Maki, the sushi restaurant chain they opened last year.
“The traditional set eight-hour shift didn’t fall at the right time for us; our peak hours are lunchtime and around 6pm, therefore, if we had people in for a normal shift then they wouldn’t really have anything to do between the hours of 2pm to 5pm,” he says.
Likewise, it didn’t always work for Maki’s employees who wanted more flexibility. “Many of them were students so they either wanted time off to study or they wanted the shift to be planned around their social lives,” claims Woodcock.
Hence, Gig was born.
To fund its London launch, the startup has raised £1 million. Backers are mostly unnamed private investors, but includes Riaz Ladha, Chairman of Omni Group, a “traditional” recruitment agency and facilities management company operating in the hospitality industry.
In a classic case of semantic hijacking, Ladha says in a statement: “Gone are the days when people want security and longevity. It’s now all about flexibility and immediacy, and Gig serves both on a plate.”
The presumption being, of course, that job security and longevity are one and the same, and that you can’t ditch one without the other.
All hail the gig economy.",2016-10-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-05-at-10-07-44.png?w=738,gig-economy,Gig wants to make it easier for millennials to pick up casual work in catering and hospitality

324,Lora Kolodny,"A startup that matches riders with drivers for paid and pre-scheduled carpooling, Scoop, has inked a deal with two big towns in the increasingly congested commuter hubs in the San Francisco Bay Area, Foster City and San Mateo.
With this deal, each city is subsidizing carpoolers’ rides so that passengers only have to pay $2 each way, and will ostensibly refrain from driving solo or taking taxis, which clog the roadways and can contribute to poor air quality.
Drivers see 50 percent to 100 percent of their expenses reimbursed through Scoop, generally, based on how many people ride with them. Before becoming a Scoop driver, a vehicle owner has to go through a motor vehicle history report ensuring they have a clean driving record.
 
 
The city-subsidized rides will kick in on October 10, but Scoop riders can begin booking their discounted carpool trips today.
As TechCrunch has previously reported, with Scoop, passengers book a ride in a car with an available seat as late as 9 p.m. the night before their commute. And they can book a ride home as late as 3:30 p.m. the day of the return trip.
The company is venture funded by Signia Venture Partners, Index Ventures, BMW i Ventures and Workday Ventures.
The company currently operates in the San Francisco Bay Area, and between Los Angeles and Century City.
According to co-founders (and brothers) Jon and Rob Sadow, Scoop has plans for national expansion, and hopes to partner with other city transit offices to encourage carpool usage, reduce traffic problems and, of course, grow the app’s user base.

Scoop works with large employers to subsidize their employees’ carpooling, too. Riders can specify whether or not they want to ride with a specific colleague or friend, or after they have taken a ride, whether they’d prefer not to ride with a particular driver or passenger again.
The company’s corporate partners have included Tesla, Cisco, Workday, Stanford Research Park companies, Salesforce and Applied Materials and Creative Artists Agency.
The company has recently surpassed 100,000 trips across eight towns in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Los Angeles metro area, Jon Sadow said. Each carpool takes an average of 1.5 riders, besides the driver, per car.
The company faces significant competition in the market for paid carpooling, not just from UberPOOL or Lyft Line, which tend to focus on shorter distances, but Google’s new Waze Rider service. ",2016-10-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/4ee3bff420224fb98c44d743bea26ba6.jpeg?w=738,"scoop,carpooling",Scoop gets Bay Area cities to pick up the tab for carpooling to alleviate traffic jams
325,Dr. Nancy Markley,"

Many startup companies begin with either an idea or a proprietary technology. Sometimes this technology is straightforward and easily explained; other times, it is novel and revolutionary.
For some founders, the latter can be a double-edged sword, especially once they begin to seek outside financing. If your technology is new, it can be hard to explain and prove. But if it is potentially disruptive, it can attract significant attention from potential investors.
The latter is what happened with the disgraced healthcare startup Theranos. Founder Elizabeth Holmes raised massive rounds of financing on the promise of a new way to test blood that would transform medical testing for all of mankind. Investors threw money at Holmes and Theranos, leading to a valuation of $9 billion at a 2014 financing round.
As the media has recently reported though, it would appear that few of Theranos’ investors had any experience in the medical and biopharma industries. Rather, those with ties to the technology industry came from software backgrounds, and the others were strong political players in the U.S.
These investors most likely did not perform their due diligence on Theranos and its technology. Because of their backgrounds, it’s possible that they did not even know what to look for. Theranos was known to keep their cards close to their chest, and was secretive about their technology and data.
Regardless, investors kept coming and giving money to the company. Were they investing without doing their own homework on the technology, instead relying on earlier investors they believed had performed due diligence themselves? In a recent op-ed for Fortune Magazine, marketing professor Kent Grayson explained this phenomenon as trusting “credence goods”:
Some excuse Theranos’ secrecy as merely protecting their intellectual property and technology, in addition to desiring confidentiality for their company. Having worked in the biotechnology industry for many years, and having raised capital for a medical products startup, I can say that that argument does not hold water.
Founders must be open to the scrutiny of due diligence. If your potential investors are bringing in scientists and experts to audit your company, you must trust them as they analyze your technology and data, especially in the medical sector. There are confidentiality agreements as well as other protections that you can put in place during the due diligence process. If you don’t trust these people to keep your secrets under a confidentiality agreement, then you shouldn’t be in business with them. There’s no reason why you can’t share your data and have it externally validated.
In Theranos’ case, it’s possible that investors invested in a technology that may ultimately not deliver what was promised. Unfortunately, this scenario does happen. Companies may oversell their technology by overstating its capabilities, or they may fail to pursue rigorous scientific procedure with respect to the efficacy of their technology. Sometimes investors get caught up in the narrative of the company. Theranos, in particular, was a media darling before The Wall Street Journal’s groundbreaking report last year.
It’s worth noting that, for the most part, well-known investors in the biotechnology and life sciences spaces, especially in Silicon Valley, did not invest in Theranos. Because these investors often have the expertise and the experience in their fields, they knew what to look for. In this case, biotechnology investors thought that Theranos’ technology seemed too good to be true. Even as Theranos continued to raise money and announce new applications of their technology, they remained unwilling to share their data. This was a red flag that told savvy biotechnology investors to stay away.
For medical startup companies, being able to share your data (under proper confidentiality agreements), having your technology validated in clinical trials and peer-reviewed in medical journals should be a welcome. It is a good thing to be able to prove the effectiveness of your product. You want to be able to show investors that your product works and has valid applications.
Founders should always be open to third-party validation. We took the time to have our first product — a medical device for treatment of snoring and sleep apnea — undergo clinical testing and peer review. By the time we took the product to market, and as we raised capital later on, we had data to share that showed that our product was clinically proven and that the technology was scientifically sound.
At the same time, due diligence is the responsibility of investors. If they don’t perform their due diligence, and they’re simply relying on the credibility or the pedigree of the management team, they risk investing in products or technology that is ultimately proven unsound.",2016-10-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/magnifying.jpg?w=738,"startup-advice,theranos","Due diligence is a responsibility for investors, an opportunity for startups"
326,Matthew Lynley,"Today, Pinterest announced that it has hired its first chief financial officer from Twitter, Todd Morgenfeld. However, there’s a more interesting footnote that’s reported in The Wall Street Journal’s story about the hire: Pinterest generated roughly $100 million in revenue last year, according to the report.
You may recall that last year TechCrunch reported, based on leaked documents we received, that the company was projecting around $169 million in revenue for 2015 (and $2.8 billion by 2018). We reported the story in October last year, and the information was used by Andreessen Horowitz to solicit limited partners to invest in a special investment fund for Pinterest earlier in the year.
So, what’s going on with the discrepancy here?
Facebook’s advertising business continues to chug along at a very healthy rate. We also reported that a leaked deck from Snapchat noted that the company had estimated that revenue would be between $250 million and $350 million for 2016, and could have been as high as $1 billion for 2017. Both of these mobile advertising strategies appear to not only be working, but growing really quickly.
Was Pinterest, in the end, still a little bit of a question mark for marketers? Most of the content that appears on Pinterest comes from businesses, and it possesses a large user base. But it may be that advertisers are still apprehensive about shifting budgets from other services like Facebook — or even emerging ones like Snapchat, which could pique greater curiosity because of their rapid growth and engagement. (Snapchat has around 150 million daily active users.)

Pinterest tries to offer a different value proposition for marketers. Brands are able to touch its users at multiple points of their buying cycles. Users can discover products through advertising tools, making them aware of their existence. Marketers can also tap into a user’s intent to potentially purchase through search. And finally, they can also hit them at points where they are ready to finally make a purchase of those products (or download an app, for example).
To be sure, Pinterest has been very methodical about expanding its business, slowly opening up advertising tools to wider and wider audiences over time. It may be that the company put the brakes on certain ad and commerce product releases until it felt like they were ready. Our reporting pointed at the projection coming from earlier in the year from when we published our story.
Perhaps the company may have been a little ambitious in its plans. This isn’t, of course, unheard of. Companies sometimes may offer a wide range of potential projections — such as the case of Snapchat, which the leaked deck shows its 2017 revenue could range from $500 million to $1 billion. Snapchat, too, has slowly been rolling out its plans for working with marketers, meaning that the final numbers that may land may end up partially (or wildly) different from the estimates offered to investors.
New advertising formats are also emerging on Pinterest, but are sometimes coming out quite a bit later than other platforms. In August, the company finally released native video advertising following the release of a native video player. Facebook, meanwhile, has had a robust video ecosystem and is clearly figuring out ways to monetize it.
That’s likely the reason why Pinterest is investing so much in its visual search tools. At an event earlier this year, Pinterest revealed that it would soon give users the ability to search for products through photos taken on your smartphone. One of Pinterest’s perceived edges is its heavy research and development in visual search, and it also recently began expanding those tools into video. Pinterest needs to find an obvious edge that can convince marketers to pull their budgets away from search (Google), Facebook and other advertising platforms.
It’s also expanded very aggressively into international markets. And it’s continuing to release more and more advertising tools. AND it continues to not only acquire companies for talent, but also some additional products like Instapaper. All of this is, of course, feeding into the company’s intent to become the visual search engine of record on the internet.
Then, there’s the case of its commerce plans. The company is trying to offer as many commerce tools as possible for its companies — and potentially to attract influencers — with things like the Buy button and showing products below videos. But buyable pins on Pinterest only came out in June last year, and it’s hard to create new user behavior (much less get people to put in a credit card), and it’s only been a short while since launch, relatively speaking.
The hiring of a CFO can, sometimes, signal ambitious plans to organize an inevitable initial public offering. A Pinterest representative told me over email that the company has “no plans for an IPO right now, as we focus on growing the business.” So Morgenfeld’s task may be to get things in order as it continues to try to woo advertisers and marketers.
We reached out to a Pinterest representative about the discrepancy, who said the company does not comment on revenue.",2016-10-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/visual-search-on-pinterest.jpg?w=738,"todd-morgenfeld,pinterest",Pinterest lagged behind leaked revenue projections in 2015
327,Matthew Lynley,"Pinterest has hired its first chief financial officer, Todd Morgenfeld — who was most recently vice president of finance at Twitter — the company said today. He was at Twitter for about a year and a half before joining Pinterest.

A representative from Pinterest said the company has “no plans for an IPO right now, as we focus on growing the business.”
“We are excited that Todd is joining Pinterest as CFO,” CEO Ben Silbermann said in a statement. “Todd brings to the company a wide range of experience from HP to the military to a fast paced environment like Twitter. He believes in our mission and the strong business opportunity it presents. We are committed to building our company for the long term and thrilled that Todd will be an integral part of continuing this growth.”
Pinterest has been aggressively expanding its advertising and commerce tools as it looks to begin generating a healthy amount of revenue. In 2015, leaked documents showed Pinterest was forecasting around $169 million in revenue, as well as a forecast of $2.8 billion in annual revenue in 2018. The company was most recently valued at $11 billion in a financing round. Of course, these forecasts can change as the year progresses, and the documents were released earlier last year.
Still, things might be a little challenging for Morgenfeld. The Wall Street Journal is also reporting that Pinterest generated roughly $100 million in revenue, which could mean it fell below the forecast laid out in the previously leaked documents. The company has released a large number of advertising tools as it looks to offer marketers an alternative option than Facebook and Google, banking on giving marketers access to multiple parts of the purchasing cycle.
Twitter, too, was in a challenging position under Morgenfeld. The company since its initial public offering has had to deal with stalling growth and a frustrated Wall Street, as it tried to put together a strong business proposition that would keep it an independent company. Earlier this month it was revealed that a number of companies, including Salesforce and Alphabet, are looking at snapping up the company as it might make sense in the context of a greater tech empire.
(Obviously Morgenfeld wasn’t running the show at Twitter, as Anthony Noto serves as the company’s CFO.)

328,John Mannes,"In a blog post this morning, Union Square Ventures formally endorsed Hillary Clinton for President of the United States. This marks the first time that the 13-year-old fund has endorsed a candidate in a presidential election.
In the brief 375 word statement, the firm addressed both the risks of a Trump presidency and the qualities that would make Clinton ideal for the job. Collectively, USV acknowledged that technological change has had a profoundly positive impact on the world, but that its benefits have not touched everyone evenly.
“We are not surprised that many feel the urge to reboot the whole system.”
However, USV believes that progress can only be made by embracing diversity and working together on equal footing to address challenges.
“There is no wall big enough to protect us from a changing climate or the unintended consequences of new technologies like artificial intelligence or DNA manipulation.”
The firm cited Clinton’s “temperament and experience” as two of the key traits that will help her to address a uniquely global problem. USV also took the moment to support Take Off Election Day and to reject the idea of a protest vote, even linking to Clay Shirky’s Medium post on the subject. The post also gave attention to HelloVote, supported by Twilio, and the non-profit VotePlz, backed by Y Combinator’s Sam Altman.
Fred Wilson, a partner at USV, Tweeted this morning that the decision to endorse Clinton was unanimous.
The prominent New York firm is not the first fund, and certainly not the first investors, to take a stand against the Republican nominee.
In late August, CRV, formally known as Charles River Ventures, denounced Trump in a highly visible “Fuck Trump” campaign on the fund’s home page. That campaign was more about protesting Tump’s immigration stance than endorsing Clinton. In a slightly less partisan move, CRV opted to create a program to cover the costs of U.S. visas for CRV company founders in addition to creating a new fellows program to provide office space for immigrant entrepreneurs.
High profile investors like Mark Suster of Upfront Ventures and Sam Altman of Y Combinator have Tweeted prolifically throughout the election cycle. Just this week, Suster even encouraged fellow investors who had previously endorsed Trump to jump ship.
Peter Thiel remains one of the highest profile investors to have endorsed Trump. The Founders Fund partner and serial entrepreneur endorsed Trump publicly back in July at the RNC. Trump has a narrow foothold in the tech world, but has struggled to raise significant capital from wealthy founders and early-stage investors.
While many individual investors have come out against Trump, I speculate most firms have tried to remain non-partisan to avoid alienating founders and limited partners. While USV is the largest and most prominent fund to have endorsed Clinton as a collective to date, we still have another month before the election, which leaves plenty of time for more surprises.

329,Sam O'Keefe,"Closing a Series A is notoriously hard — so much so that it has been coined the “Series A Crunch.” It’s estimated that only about 25 percent of startups that raise a seed round go on to close an A round.
Shippo, a multi-carrier shipping API, is one startup that made it through. Last month, the company announced their $7 million Series A led by USV. Albert Wenger will be joining the board.
As a special treat, Shippo decided to make both their seed and Series A decks public (included below) so other entrepreneurs can learn from their experience. The decks have had sensitive information removed but CEO Laura Behrens Wu sat down to talk us through the process.
TC: Let’s start back in 2014 when you were looking to raise a seed round. When did you know it was time to fundraise? What were your goals going in?
Wu: We had been working on Shippo for seven months when we decided to raise. Four of those had been on our own and then we spent three months in 500 Startups. We knew it was time to raise when we looked at our growth numbers. We had the basics of the business established; a working product, happy customers and growing volumes. At that point though, I couldn’t say we had hit product/market fit. We’ve iterated so many times since then!
As first time founders, we sought out the right backers — people who would be engaged and help us grow the company. We also wanted to keep the funding process to a discrete timeline so we could get back to focusing on growing the business.
TC: You and your co-founder Simon are both international founders. How did you build out your network of investors in the U.S.? 
Wu: Initially through 500 Startups, then its about building your own reputation. You want investors (founders, and everyone) you meet to perceive you as genuine, responsible. It’s important that you do what you promise to do — you can’t just take advice and waste people’s time then do nothing with them.
TC: What metrics were most important to investors at that stage of the company?
Wu: Investors wanted to see signs of traction. We were able to show a product that people were consistently using and liking (usage up, retention up and low churn). The other item that constantly came up was the market size, to make sure enough potential exists for a venture-backed company.
TC: At the seed stage of a company, many teams don’t have metrics or don’t have enough metrics for meaningful insights. What advice would you give them?
Wu: Focus on a single KPI. You don’t need multiple metrics for the sake of having them. Focus on one that really matters. If you can’t figure that out (or hit the metric), make sure that you have happy customers who can’t live without your product.
TC: What was the hardest thing to convince investors of?
Wu: Despite the rise of marketplaces and e-commerce, shipping is something that not many investors think about. Unless they dive deep into the problem, shipping sounds very boring. However, once someone starts to understand the different layers of the problems, how our technology has been able to solve them, and also the promise of the data, excitement picked up.
TC: How long did the round take to close and how was it structured?
Wu: All-in, it took about 4 months once we decided to focus on doing the raise. We spoke to 125 investors as part of the process. Once we got the momentum, the round came together very fast and everything closed within 3 weeks. At that time YC Safe wasn’t out yet, so we worked with standard convertible notes docs provided by the law firm and Jeff Clavier put them into a priced round (very standard docs and processes).
Something that we did differently was a priced round for the seed, and giving a board seat (which goes against popular advice). However, for us this was very valuable. It’s a sign that this person on the board would be dedicated to helping us and pushing us to be successful. When we raised the Series A, Jeff stepped off the board to make room for the more typical situation where the Series A investor takes the board seat.
TC: What’s been the biggest challenge growing a company from a seed stage to being ready for a Series A?
Wu: Expectations of the founders change really quickly — you need to go from doing everything yourself to hiring experts and delegating responsibility to them. Our role as founders evolved rapidly as we scaled. As the team is built, the frenetic pace wanes, we’re freed up to tackle larger challenges, but the pressures are still there — they just feel different.
TC: Hiring seems to be something every founder struggles with. How did you learn to hire effectively?
Wu: Initially, referrals worked the best — people who have worked for you, with you. But that doesn’t scale.
We’re still learning how to hire at scale. It’s one of our biggest focuses right now with the Series A; at one point I spent 80 percent of my time on hiring. Now, we’re testing out many different things, from recruiters, employee referral bonuses, branding, conferences, etc. Stay tuned, hopefully I’ll have more to share soon!
TC: How did you decide which VCs to approach for your Series A? How many did you meet with as compared with your seed round?
Wu: We met 25 VC firms for the Series A. For us, it was not only about the right firm but also the right partner within the firm. We wanted to work with a group of investors who had experience in building large marketplace and e-commerce companies, preferably someone who understood the shipping problems that merchants faced. We were thrilled to welcome Albert Wenger from USV, as well as continuing to have the support of our other seed investors. Albert’s experience with both Twilio (as another API company) and Etsy is invaluable.
It was a much tighter process than the seed round. We had a timeline and we drove the process instead of the other way.
TC: In addition to the deck, what, if any, other materials did you prepare as part of the diligence.
Wu: To prepare for Series A meetings we made sure our financial model and forecasts were accurate and thorough, and had customer references ready to go. We also did Social Capital’s magic 8-ball analysis — which was valuable for other investors and ourselves. It’s something that we are continuing to use to monitor our health today.
TC: What do you wish you had known going into raising a Series A?
Wu: You can’t get to know a Series A investor over the course of the few weeks’ process. You need to start building relationships early, before you actively start to fundraise. When the funding time comes, you should already know who you’d like to work with and the conversations are more effective.
TC: You’ve spoken often with your investors Albert Wenger (USV) and Jeff Clavier (SoftTech VC). How important is it to have active advisors? 
Wu: I have monthly calls with Jeff but I can and do call him as needed. Whenever something is up I can text him anytime. Same goes with Albert!
I’m a firm believer that constant communication creates trust. Investors should never be surprised when they hear (bad) news, they should be in the loop on the development. The board meeting should have no surprises.
Jeff and Albert, as well as our seed investors Boris Wertz at Version One, FundersClub and 500 Startups, have been invaluable in the process of negotiating with big companies, introductions to potential customers, speaking with candidates who we’re recruiting and offering advice for operational matters.
TC: It’s hard to get to a Series A but it’s just as hard to get to a Series B. How do you think about sustaining or improving your growth moving forward?
Wu: Sustaining growth ties back to hiring. Back in the days when it was just Simon and I, we had to do everything and make it work. But now, we need to make that repeatable. We need to set up structure, process and are bringing in experts to help make that happen. Hiring an awesome exec team is very important.
Not all investors we met decided to invest. We received a lot of great feedback in the process of fundraising. We brought this back to the team and are using it to improve various aspects of our business.
TC: What’s next for Shippo?
Wu: We want to provide anyone and any business the technology to ship smarter.

330,Matthew Lynley,"While at LinkedIn, Steve Goodman and his co-founders spent a lot of their time trying to help companies dig up the best possible candidates from those that exist around the Web — but might not have applied.
But after candidates have applied, their resumes are sitting in a database somewhere on a company’s servers. And they continue to sit there, likely untouched or only lightly searched, even as companies continue to scour for new potential candidates for roles they need to fill. While those candidates might not have been in the right place at the right time, they might now be the right people to hire.
Restless Bandit, a new company from Goodman and his co-founders, is looking to give companies a way to easily find the best candidates that have already applied, rather than companies having to sift through those existing resumé piles with keywords and the like. Taking a similar approach to how LinkedIn scoured the Internet (and LinkedIn, of course) for new candidates, Restless Bandit finds the highest-potential candidates for roles with statistical modeling. The company said it has raised $8 million in a financing round from GGV Capital and Toba Capital, and it previously raised $2 million in a seed funding round.
“We’re taking a resume, we’re building a statistical model around that resume, abstracting it out and the same for the job descriptions,” Goodman said. “What that gives you is the opportunity that good people don’t fall through the cracks.”
Restless Bandit is essentially trying to draw correlations between a specific candidate and a set of more generalized candidate spaces that might suit specific roles that an employer is looking for. The higher the probability that a candidate fits a certain set of qualifications — as well as the job that recruiters are trying to fill also hitting those same qualifications — the higher they are likely to get surfaced in those results.
Part of the problem is drawing correlations between skill sets in order to find the right position. A recruiter might be looking into old resumes trying to find someone with expertise using Marketo, though if they have expertise using Hubspot those skills might be easily transferable and make those candidates also valuable, Goodman said. Restless Bandit also makes sure that the gaps between an existing resume and the information about that candidate that’s available on the web is also updated, Goodman says, so the company has a continuous profile of that candidate.
Goodman sold his previous company, Bright, to LinkedIn for around $130 million. But while LinkedIn was largely focused on finding new candidates that might not have already applied to those companies, Goodman said he saw an opportunity in doing something that was a little perpendicular in sifting through massive resume piles that already exist. Those piles can even range in the tens, to hundreds of thousands, or even millions for larger enterprises like Coca-Cola.
At the moment, there’s another issue for recruiters as well: candidates that stuff their resumes with keywords in order to get picked up by those search engines. As a result, resumes that are keyword-heavy may end up surfacing higher than candidates that may actually be more qualified, while Restless Bandit looks to try to draw correlations between strong candidates and excise those sorts of problems.
Taking an algorithmic approach, too, can help companies try to excise as much bias as they can throughout the process — because they’re centered around a data-centric approach rather than a simple gut check that might be impacted by an unconscious bias. Though, the algorithms have to be carefully tuned so as to not themselves create weird quirks or biases in the process. That’s always going to be a challenge, and it’s up to the company to ensure that it from running into some kind of endless loop that doesn’t actually achieve what it wants to achieve.
“One thing our algorithm started to notice in working with pharmaceutical companies, [for sales representatives it] started to pick up Smith College, an all women’s college in the northeast, it started to go crazy only surfacing people from Smith College,” Goodman said. “It’s an example where the algorithm can go so far that it becomes discriminatory in the other direction. We had to actually go back and rethink the way we get at those types of algorithms spinning out of control.”
While Goodman says there are no exact direct competitors, there are of course variations — but the larger looming threat is the possibility that Google or Facebook, with their own approaches to doing these kinds of things, could end up open sourcing what they use. That, and keyword search tools for resumes could become increasingly sophisticated, or those tools may also branch into a more algorithmic approach.
In the end, Restless Bandit will have to end up in the hands of job-seekers in some fashion, though Goodman said he isn’t quite sure what that looks like just yet. For now, the company is focusing on large enterprises — ones that generally have more than 1,000 employees — but it’s still going to require the right resumes going to the right spots in the first place, even if they aren’t the right fit at the right time.
“We’re thinking about it from the company perspective, but ultimately where this has to go is the candidate,” Goodman said. “This tech has to get to the candidate to help them weed through where their true opportunities are and where they aren’t and they’re chasing their tail.”",2016-10-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/hrtech-screenshot-01.jpg?w=738,"job-hunting,resumes",Restless Bandit raises $8M to help companies dig through their old resume piles
331,Steve O'Hear,"Source{d} provides an interesting use-case for AI. The Spain-headquartered startup, which today is announcing $6 million in Series A funding, is using deep learning to help startups and larger companies recruit developers. Specifically, its AI tech is analysing the code of millions of developers via their open source contributions in order to match them to appropriate job openings.
“We use this analysis to understand how good they are at any given language and framework and match them with companies looking for developers,” is how Source{d} co-founder and COO Jorge Schnura explains it.
He also says it isn’t just about identifying code quality or a developer’s ability, but also coding style and other nuances that differentiates one developer from another. And it’s this aspect that benefits from a “deep neural network” approach.
“We can [find] people who are similar to your team,” adds Schnura. “This is all unsupervised learning since we don’t tell our algorithms which features to look for, it defines them itself”.
Meanwhile, the company, which is only in its second year of operation, say it’s already close to being profitable and on track to close the year something approaching €1 million in revenue. It claims 200 clients ranging from small to medium-sized startups, right up to a number of corporates.
Backing Source{d}’s Series A round are three European investment funds: Xavier Niel’s own fund, Otium Venture, and Sunstone Capital. The company already has offices in Madrid and Berlin, and says the new capital will be used to expand to London, Paris, Stockholm, Amsterdam, New York, Boston and San Francisco.
It also plans to further develop its product, including applying its AI-driven analysis of code to other products aimed at developers, both free and paid-for. In other words, recruitment is just the start.",2016-10-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/sourced-10.jpg?w=738,,"Source{d}, a Spanish startup using AI to match developers to jobs, raises $6M"
332,Steve O'Hear,"“FINE WINE RETAILER TANNICO QUAFFS €3.8M IN SERIES A FUNDING,” screams the press release, conjuring up an image of a startup spending all of its newly acquired cash on one giant Dot Com-fueled booze up. Sadly (or luckily for the company’s new backers), this story isn’t that!
Founded by ex-VC Marco Magnocavallo, Tannico is a classic ‘Long Tail’ retail play, matching disparate supply (including wines from smaller wineries) with demand, thus bringing the antiquated fine wine market in Europe online.
It also claims to employ “big data and artificial intelligence” tech to build a “unique taste DNA” of each customer and provide personalised wine recommendations via a feature it calls an “Automated Sommelier”. That sounds a lot like a fancy way of describing a recommendation engine to me. But what do I know…
“After selling Blogo to RCS Media Group and being a VC for several years, I again needed the stress and vibrant energy that only a new startup can guarantee,” Magnocavallo told me in an email. “Having already founded an e-commerce company in the early 2000s, I was intrigued to start a new retail business but in a different vertical”.
Tellingly, he says he chose wine based on two different but strong factors: Italy is the first or second largest wine producer in the world with more than 100,000 wineries, and the Italian online wine market was at only 0.2 per cent penetration and had “huge opportunities of growth in the next few years”. Classic VC thinking that appears to be panning out.
Launched in 2012, Milan-headquartered Tannico already claims a 15 per cent share of the Italian market, stocking over 6,000 wines from over 1,000 wineries. Last year it sold 250,000 bottles of wine to a total of 40,000 customers. Beyond Italy, the company plans to enter the UK market next followed by Switzerland and France.
Meanwhile, Italian VC P101 led today’s Series A, with participation from private investors Matteo de Brabant (founder of Jakala), Maurizio di Robilant (founder of Robilant Associati, described as the Italian market leader in brand advisory and design) and Stefano Saccardi (Board member and managing director at Campari).",2016-10-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/marco-magnocavallo.jpg?w=738,,Wine retailer Tannico “quaffs” €3.8M Series A
333,Josh Constine,"Every member of the Facebook family of apps is pushing to bring copies of Snapchat’s best features to international audiences before Snapchat blows up abroad. There was the Facebook Camera Feed, Instagram Stories and Messenger Day — and now WhatsApp is cloning Snapchat’s creative tools.
Now you’ll be able to add overlaid text with multiple colors and fonts, drawings and emojis to photos and videos you shoot or upload with WhatsApp. These allow for better visual communication, where you can add captions, highlight certain things, jazz up scenes with silly doodles or augment them with emoji. Snapchat popularized this style of chat, which can feel more fun, inspired and vivid than messaging with just text or unadorned images.
WhatsApp has also grabbed Snapchat’s front-facing flash feature for illuminating your face by blinking your screen white, which lets you take low-light selfies. Meanwhile, you can zoom in before taking a photo or while shooting a video by dragging a single finger up and down the screen, which allows one-handed zooming.
In the U.S., this move might come off as blatant stealing of features that have become synonymous with Snapchat. Snapchat has 150 million daily users, with 60 million of them in the U.S. and Canada.
But WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly users scattered all over the developing markets of the world. Many of those countries don’t see much Snapchat adoption, so these people might not associate these creative tools with Snapchat. Instead, they might simply see this update as a big improvement to WhatsApp.
The international messaging juggernaut doesn’t have all the nifty features of Snapchat, like animated selfie lenses, geofilters or augmented reality 3D stickers. But if it can offer decent creative tools for visual communication, WhatsApp’s users might have less reason to stray to Snapchat if the ephemeral app eventually becomes popular in their area.
Good-enough features plus being the first app to offer them at scale in a market could succeed better than having the best features but showing up late.",2016-10-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/whatsapp.png?w=738,,WhatsApp races to internationalize Snapchat’s overlaid creative tools
334,Megan Rose Dickey,"The criminal justice system in our country is broken. Just imagine if technologists put their resources and knowledge toward solving some of our country’s biggest issues, instead of toward the next dating app. Today at South by South Lawn, the White House’s first-ever festival of art, ideas and action, I got a glimpse of what that world might look like.
My first stop was to 6’x9′, a virtual reality experience that shows you what it’s like to be in solitary confinement. Created in partnership by The Guardian and The Mill, 6’x9′ puts you inside a virtual 6-foot by 9-foot prison cell with just a bed, toilet and small area to put down some books. The nine-minute experience was designed using game engine technology and first-person accounts for the cell design and audio capture. Even though I was only “in” solitary confinement for nine minutes, it was intense. In the U.S., there are between 80,000 to 100,000 people held in solitary confinement for over 23 hours a day, which cannot possibly be good for someone’s mental health.
“There’s been lots of work done on what that does to someone’s brain and irreversible mental issues associated with it,” Zu Alkadiri, executive producer of The Mill told me.
With 6’x9′, the goal is to use technology to effect social change, Alkadiri said.
“It’s the perfect use of the medium to create an empathetic connection to a problem or situation that 99.9% of the human race never have to experience — thank goodness,” Alkadiri said. “It’s an important story to tell and this is a great use of technology to tell it.”
Another exhibit that stuck out was one by Justice for Us, which lets people step into the role of a judge and make decisions about how many years someone should get for a crime. At the end of the scenario, you see what the actual — usually grim — outcome was.
“As opposed to hitting people over the head with stats, this invites you to play a part.” Jesse Inman, the lead developer of Justice For Us told me. “The goal is then a variety of these experiences, like being a police officer, being someone awaiting trial, being the warden of the prison and what it’s like to make decisions like cutting education programs and profit and those kind of things.”
Another goal for this project is for it to live beyond the team and ultimately get it to the point where it affects policy, Inman said. But it’s ultimately about educating people around what’s going on in our criminal justice system and how decisions are being made.
“The majority of people are unaware of the brokenness in our criminal justice system, especially the people most enabled to do something about it,” Inman said. “The people who can do the most about it know the least. If we can give people the experience of being a member of the criminal justice system in America, that could help them better understand its brokenness from a very different angle.”",2016-10-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/dsc00445.jpg?w=738,"sxsl-2016,sxsl",White House’s SXSL shows what it’s like to be in the criminal justice system
335,Sarah Buhr,"Benchling, a biotech company out of Y Combinator providing cloud-based software for researchers, tells TechCrunch it has raised $7 million in growth funding to continue creating tools to help the science community access research from big pharma and other leaders in the space.
You might think of Benchling as the Google Docs portion of the life sciences industry. While IT solutions software isn’t the sexiest thing happening in biotech, it’s an important step in organizing the research to get to those breakthroughs and Benchling provides that part of the ecosystem.
But what started out as a cloud collaboration tool for scientists has grown since its launch in 2012 to include more than 40,000 researchers (up from 2,000 in 2014) and now works with some of the biggest players in the business such as MIT labs, Zymergen, Editas and the top 20 pharma labs in the country, according to the startup.

In just the past year Benchling says it has made strides to make its software faster and even more powerful to enable researchers to extract the information needed when they need it — multiples faster than what one might get with a simple query from a Google or excel spreadsheet.
Thrive Capital led the round, joined by previous investors Andreessen Horowitz (which led the previous round), and a number of angel investors, including Y Combinator partner Geoff Ralston, Sequoia partner Matt Huang and CXO of Tencent David Wallerstein.
Ashton Kutcher, who has said in the past he was interested in putting more money into biotech startups, is a notable new Benchling benefactor, adding a small but undisclosed amount to this latest round of financing.

336,Sarah Perez,"Amid an increasing number robo-investors like Betterment, Stash, and Robinhood, a new San Francisco-based fintech startup called Grow is entering the fray to compete based on investment type, not only financial returns. While the app operates much like its rivals in terms of making it easier for novice investors quickly build their portfolios, its biggest differentiator is that it focuses only on environmentally sustainable, socially responsible companies with good governance.
This makes the app something that may appeal to younger users, who are typically more selective about where they choose to spend their money.
For example, Nielsen studies have found that the majority of millennials make sustainability a shopping priority. Grow aims to find out if they make it a priority when they begin investing, too.
The startup was founded by Head of Product Michael DeMaria, who has a background in finance, and CTO Anthony Randazzo. It’s led by CEO Doug Heske, a Bay Area finance vet who joined in March 2016.
To determine where to invest, Grow has developed its own proprietary database and analytics tool, Grow Analytics, to identify those investments that respect certain values, like environmental, social and governance, while also minimizing portfolio risk. It seeks out investments across sectors, industries and assets classes, too, in order to offer a balanced and diversified portfolio. That means you can use Grow as your primary robo-investing app, not as a supplemental product.

To use the app, you first tell it what sort of values you most care about – like the environment or social responsibility, for example. You can add money to Grow or schedule a monthly deposit to fund your account by linking your bank, then Grow will automatically invest in your personalized portfolio on your behalf.
You can see your investments’ growth right on the app’s homepage, displayed as a circle that shows both the present and future value.

 
To generate revenue, Grow charges 0.25% for management fees through the app. However, its business model also includes other means of generating revenue outside the app, as well. For example, Grow’s full service asset management arm, Grow Capital Management, charges management fees between .25% and .75%. Also, it licenses Grow Analytics to investment and research institutions for a monthly fee.
The app itself soft-launched back in February on the iTunes App Store for testing purposes and feedback with some 350 users. As of this week, a revamped and redesigned version went live, and is now available to everyone.
The startup has been self-funded up until last month, but is currently raising $3 million in seed funding in a round that’s only partially complete. So far, two major California-based family offices have committed capital.
Grow is a free download on the iTunes App Store. ",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-29-at-10-26-56-am.png?w=738,"investing,fintech,finance,apps",Grow launches its app for socially responsible investing
337,Josh Constine,"Robinhood says it will never charge commissions to trade stocks, but the $66 million-funded startup is finally ramping up monetization with the launch of “Robinhood Gold” premium features. For $10 per month, users can skip the three-day waiting period with instant deposits and reinvesting, trade 30 minutes before and 2 hours after the market is open, and borrow up to double the money in their account to trade on margin with leverage.
The basic zero-fee trading appeals to younger, less wealthy, less experienced traders who make small investments where the $7-plus commission fees charged by competitors like Scottrade and E*Trade could eradicate their potential gains.
That’s nearly as much as Robinhood charges for its Gold subscription, which could lure veteran traders from those services. That could in turn bring in larger balances which fuel the original way Robinhood makes money — interest on cash people store in their account.

“Robinhood Gold is to our core product as Amazon Prime is to Amazon” says Robinhood co-CEO Baiju Bhatt [Disclosure: We were friends in college]. “It makes it better in a consistent way for people who use the product a lot.” At first, Robinhood Gold will roll out to about 15% of the app’s user base, and extend from there to other qualified users after testing.
Gold users won’t have to wait three days for the ACH transfers to process when they fund their Robinhood balance from their bank account, or when they sell stock and want to buy more stock with the proceeds. Pre- and post-bell trading gives smaller investors an option to trade on after-hours news like earnings reports. Trading from 9am to 9:30am when markets open and from 4pm to 6pm after they close was typically reserved for big institutional investors.
The most important premium feature, though, is additional buying power. which Bhatt calls “basically a credit card for the stock market.” As long as users have at least $2,000 in their account, they can borrow up to 2X that amount for $10 per month and trade with it.

Robinhood is also selling higher-priced subscriptions with more buying power: $4000 for $20/month, $6000 for $30/month, $10,000 for $50/month, and buying power up to $50,000 at a 5% interest rate. There are some restrictions on risky buying behavior, so you can’t dump thousands into a newly IPO’d company, leveraged ETFs, or stocks priced under $3.00 because they’re too volatile.
Now the question is whether traders interested in these advanced options are ready for a mobile-only trading app. Bhatt expects Robinhood Gold will be the startup’s primary revenue source.
The income could help Robinhood make good on the $66 million in funding it’s taken from Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, GV (Google Ventures), Index, Slow Ventures, and celebs like Nas, Snoop Dogg, and Jared Leto. Robinhood is looking like one of the top portfolio companies for Rothenberg Ventures, the disgraced fund that recently changed its name to Frontier Tech Ventures.
Founded in 2013 by two Stanford grads who’d built high-frequency trading tech for big hedge funds, Robinhood now has over one million registered users. It’s handled $12 billion in transactions and saved people over $200 million in commission fees. The app is hockey-sticking, with transaction volume doubling just since June.
Yet Bhatt laughs that “The oldest question people have about Robinhood? ‘How are you ever gonna make money?'” The startup had until now focused on democratizing stock trading by making it affordable to everyone, not earning money for itself.
Robinhood’s mobile nature makes it tempting to impulse-buy stocks which could get people in trouble if they’re trading on borrowed credit via Gold. Bhatt is cognizant of the risk, saying “We want to help people make decisions that they’re comfortable with and that they understand.” Otherwise, who would want to come back to an app where they lost a ton of dough?
And since Robinhood is storing people’s money, the startup has to be extraordinarily vigilant when it comes to security. A breach could scare customers away to more established brokerages.
Down the line, Robinhood plans to build a web product to complement its mobile-first apps, and will keep adding features to Robinhood Gold. For now, it’s software will keep eating stock trading, replacing brick-and-mortar brokerage offices with apps, and sharing the savings with its users.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gold-iphone-shot1.png?w=738,"stock-trading,robinhood",Free stock trade app Robinhood monetizes with $10/month to buy on credit
338,Sarah Perez,"Online banking service Simple is today rolling out a new product: shared accounts. However, unlike joint checking accounts typically shared by spouses, Simple’s shared accounts work differently. They allow customers to maintain their own accounts, but quickly fund then switch over to shared accounts to collaborate with each other on financial planning by tracking shared expenses, setting goals, and keeping an eye on the shared account’s “safe-to-spend” balance, which includes the money not already committed to bill payments and savings.
Because customers continue to have their own individual bank account, Simple Shared can be used by anyone who needs to combine their money, including not only those in relationships, but also roommates, siblings, or even parents and their young adult children.
 
Simple Shared
With Simple Shared, Simple is looking to change the way people handle shared finances.
First of all, the sign-up process for a Shared account is very quick, compared with traditional banking. To get started, the two users just link their individual accounts together, and a shared account is created in seconds.
It has also rethought account access. Instead of logging in and out of the different accounts, customers can quickly switch between their individual and shared accounts, with just a few taps.

Plus, like individual accounts, Simple Shared accounts offer access to the same feature set, which includes the ability to set savings goals, track your available balance, pay bills, and fund through direct deposits, if desired.
It also comes with its own Visa card and doesn’t charge any fees. Unfortunately, like individual accounts, the interest rate remains low – only 0.01% – but Simple tells us this will change in the future.
What’s most interesting is where the product fits in today’s broader financial landscape, Simple Shared isn’t only a competitor to traditional joint accounts, but also to quick money transfer services like Venmo or Square Cash. That’s because you can move money in between your own account and the shared account instantly.
So while Venmo might come in handy for splitting the bill at a restaurant, Simple Shared accounts may be better for more things like paying bills with your roommates, given that it’s a real bank account either person can access in order to view, manage, and analyze their shared spending and savings.

Simple, as you may recall, had originally made a name for itself by ditching fees and modernizing the interfaces customers use to interact with their bank accounts, including on mobile, before being acquired by BBVA, where it still operates independently as its own brand. However, post-acquisition, the service had been slow to deliver on its earlier promises of making banking easy – it flubbed its biggest upgrade, for example, and continued to suffer glitches months after the fact.
However, in the years since, Simple has recovered and stabilized, even if it was no longer steadily rolling out new features.
That said, the banking service has seen customer growth hit about 50% in the first half of the year, and says it has brought on more customers per month in the past few months than many banks do in a year. In addition, over the past year Simple says it grew by 120%, versus average growth for personal retail checking growth which is about 7% annually.
Simple Shared is launching today into beta, and will be adding users to a waitlist, as it expects demand.

As is easily guessed by the name, Snap It beta lets users take photos of their daily meals and snacks to automatically log them and derive approximate calorie counts.
For now, users will be able to open the Lose It! app, pick a meal-type (breakfast, lunch, dinner or snack), take a photo of their food, submit and wait briefly for Snap It to analyze it.
Snap It will present users with a few best guesses of what food was portrayed in the submitted pic. Users can then confirm the food seen in the photo, and add more detail.
For example if they’ve uploaded a pic of sushi, Snap It may recognize “sushi roll,” but not know if it contained salmon, or just cucumbers, or whether the roll was made with brown instead of white rice.
After labeling the contents of their meal, users are prompted to confirm an approximate serving size, and the meal is officially logged.
Lose It! built Snap It as a neural network that gets smarter over time, or better able to identify foods in photos and their portions automatically.
Because the system is still in beta, CEO Charles Teague says, it’s more like Tesla’s driver assistive technology today, than the Tesla vehicles of the future that promise to be fully self-driving.
Lose It built its initial model for Snap It beta using something called the Food 101 dataset, which defines 101 food categories and contains 101,000 images that map to these categories.
Lose It claims that Snap It beta achieves 87.3% to 97.1% accuracy already within that data set. And as users contribute more images and descriptions, Snap It should become even more precise and accurate.
While logging meals with photos on social media is common, Lose It is taking on a more complicated endeavor. It wants to deliver accurate assessments of meals seen in users’ photos, but also help them count calories as precisely as possible, and even figure out nutritional information to improve their diets.
Lose It!’s goal is to help its users lose weight or maintain a healthy weight.
Teague said, “Ultimately we want to make understanding your diet as simple as Fitbit made understanding your activity. Snap It is going to give us the opportunity to reach a whole new set of users that may have found tracking frustrating or might’ve never even tried it because it seemed too time consuming. When tracking is a simple as snapping a picture, it becomes accessible to nearly everyone.”
The company’s new Snap It! initiative is competing with food recognition technologies like SRI International’s Ceres project, and Google’s IM2 Calories.
Though ultimately, FitNow Inc. could put others’ AI systems to work to power Lose It! features as well.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/lose-it_stills_in-app_4x3-ratio_orange.jpg?w=738,lose-it,Lose It launches Snap It to let users count calories in food photos
340,Anthony Ha,"Meetup is giving users a new way to find the meetups that give the company its name.
The New York City-based company is launching new smartphone apps and a (partially) redesigned website with new branding, as well as a new way to browse meetup listings.
“We killed the calendar,” CEO and co-founder Scott Heiferman said. Instead, Meetup will recommend listings for you based on your own interests, and you’ll also be able to see listings of meetups that are new, trending or happening soon.
That might not seem like a dramatic difference, but Heiferman said it reflects the real way that people use the Meetup service. The calendar view makes you think you should be looking for “what’s going on in Paris tonight,” but he argued, “That’s not how people think. What Meetup is about is saying, ‘I want to run more, I want to go to writing meetups.'”

You may not have heard much from Meetup recently, but Heiferman said the service has grown to 25 million members. He also said the company is profitable — browsing the listings is free, but meetup organizers have to pay a subscription fee.
Heiferman contrasted the Meetup approach with companies like Facebook that are investing in virtual reality.
“We say, fuck VR,” he said. “Let’s really invest, let’s use AI to invent an IRL experience that is something special.”",2016-09-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/arts.jpg?w=738,"scott-heiferman,meetup",Meetup redesigns its mobile apps to focus on your personal interests
341,Lora Kolodny,"Today, goTenna is taking pre-orders for their new product, a device called the goTenna Mesh that lets smartphone users text and share their GPS locations, off-grid and across miles of terrain.
The new device works like goTenna’s flagship product did in that it can be used where normal cellular, satellite or wifi services are not available. And like the company’s flagship goTenna, users pair the device to their phones using bluetooth, then use goTenna’s app to create and send messages.
But what’s different is that the goTenna Mesh sends communications across publicly available UHF frequencies, and it meshes.
The new hardware doesn’t have an external antennae —that means it is compact, and allows the company to sell the goTenna Mesh internationally.
Daniela Perdomo, goTenna’s co-founder and CEO said:
“Sometimes you cannot plug into traditional communications systems because they are not available, like after a storm, or are unreliable at a crowded event, or unaffordable, say if you are traveling or living on a restricted budget. So we’re building grassroots, bottoms-up communications systems.”
The startup also launched its premium, goTenna Plus service today, which gives users access to offline topographic maps, read receipts for messages they send, trip statistics, automated location tracking and the ability to relay messages across traditional SMS networks when a goTenna comes within range or bounces that message to someone connected to a traditional network.
The company also released a software development kit today.
According to a company statement, “The goTenna SDK allows any developer to use goTenna hardware and protocols to transmit small bursts of secure data, at long ranges, completely off-grid.” It has already been in pilot tests with the U.S. Air Force and health tech companies.
A goTenna Mesh pair costs $129 if you pre-order via Kickstarter today, and will later retail for $179, no subscription required. The optional goTenna Plus premium subscription costs $9.99 a year for the first year, and $29.99 per year after that.
That’s a significantly lower price point than military- and enterprise-grade communications systems would cost, the kind that are used to keep people connected in off-grid situations, like after a natural disaster, or regions without much telecom infrastructure today.
Those typically cost thousands of dollars, Perdomo said.

According to the Brooklyn-based startup, point-to-point range for the goTenna Mesh is typically up to one mile in most congested areas and up to about three miles in a typical open terrain.
But the new devices allow users to privately relay a message through another goTenna user to the one they’re trying to reach if that intended recipient is out of range.
So, for example, if a group is on a camping trip off-grid, and one person is injured, the group’s members could spread out but still stay in touch as one person hikes furthest away, beyond 3 miles, to seek help.
The more users join a goTenna Mesh group, the more powerful it becomes, in essence.
GoTenna was co-founded by brother and sister duo Daniela and Jorge Perdomo after they experienced widespread communications systems failures following Hurricane Sandy in New York City.
GoTenna is backed by venture investors including Walden Venture Capital, MentorTech Ventures, BBG Ventures (a subsidiary of Verizon), and Bloomberg Beta.

342,Sarah Perez,"Got iOS 10? Want to mess with your friends? A hilarious new iMessage App called Phoneys lets you prank others by sending stickers that look exactly like iMessage text bubbles. And thanks to the new layering feature in the updated version of iMessage, you can place these stickers – which say things like “My political views are totally wrong” or “I have terrible taste in music” – overtop your friend’s message to make it look like they texted these self-deprecating statements to you.
Yep, you can actually put words in your friend’s mouth, then laugh while they try to figure out if they’ve lost their mind, or their phone has been hacked.
Taking advantage of layering is what makes this new app so clever. In iOS 10, iMessage now lets you place stickers on top of incoming text messages, photos, GIFs or even other stickers. The idea is that you could react to a text with a sticker, you could decorate an incoming photo, or even take turns with friends making a sticker collage.
However, not everyone is aware of how stickers work in iOS 10 just yet, which gives you time to enjoy an app like Phoneys.
Here’s how it works. After downloading and installing Phoneys from the iMessage App Store, look for a text message you want to change. Scroll through the available “phoney” texts you want to replace that message with, and drag it on top of the original text.
There are a number of fake texts to pick from, ranging from more generic statements, like “you’re so smart,” or “you’re hilarious,” to those that may be more useful in specific discussions, like “you make this parenting thing look easy,” or “the sports team I pull for sucks,” for example.
For extra fun, just respond to the “phoney” text to continue the conversation, and watch as your friend reacts in confusion.
Ha! 
Phoneys’ creator Adam Howell, who works full-time as a remote employee for San Francisco-based Lithium, likes to develop apps in his free time. When iMessage stickers were announced this June at WWDC, he began working nights and weekends on his first pack, Guises.
Following Guises’ launch, Howell began trying out ideas of what to build next, he says.
“I noticed how you could completely cover up texts with stickers. I started joking with a friend that I could maybe make him say anything I wanted,” explains Howell. “So I made a couple quick stickers locally on my iPhone to test it out, and sure enough it worked.”
After tweeting out the idea last week, Howell says he received such positive feedback that he decided to get to work.
Now that Phoneys is live, Howell says he plans to release another set of stickers to expand the current collection some time next week, and he’s considering creating an app that will let people write their own “phoney” texts.
The app is a $0.99 download on the iMessage App Store, but even if you only use it once, you’ll get your money’s worth.",2016-09-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-28-at-11-44-51-am.png?w=738,"stickers,apps,ios-apps,imessage-apps",This crazy iMessage app lets you prank friends by putting words in their mouth
343,Jon Russell,"If you travel a lot, or even just a little, you’ll be sick of roaming bills, or frustrated by the inconvenience of the cheaper alternative: buying a local SIM and switching it with your regular one. Hong Kong-based Tink Labs believes it has a better solution, a designated mobile device in your hotel room that you can use for free, and it has raised a whopping $125 million to expand its idea to cover more hotels worldwide.
The new financing was providing by existing investor and manufacturing giant Foxconn (via its FIH Mobile unit), with participation from Sinovation Ventures, the investment firm from ex-Google China head Kaifu Lee, and Cai Wensheng, a prolific angel investor who is Chairman of popular Chinese photo service Meitu.
Tink Labs CEO 24-year-old Terence Kwok declined to provide the company’s valuation, but hinted that it is above $500 million.
“We’re not a unicorn yet, but are more than halfway there,” he said.
That would make it the highest-valued tech startup in Hong Kong, and certainly one of the most notable in Asia, yet Kwok is happy to remain discreet and focused on business.
“We’ve kept a low profile even though there’s a consumer element to the product,” he said.
Tink Labs began as a device rental service that targeted travelers at airports, but Kwok said it pivoted when the team found that the business wasn’t as scalable as hoped.
“We quickly released people just want to get the hell out of the airport,” he said.
It remained focused on travelers, but moved its touch point to hotels where it has founded traction, raising over $170 million from investors to date, today’s announcement included, and working with major groups like Starwood, Accor, Shangri-la, and Melia.
Tink Labs’ flagship product is Handy, a smartphone for hotel guests that takes the pain out of mobile roaming. You can make calls and send messages like a normal phone, but it also includes details of services available at your hotel and nearby activities. It even hooks into the hotel’s telephone system so you can order room service before you get back to your room, call a colleague via their room number, or phone the helpdesk if you’re out and about but need help talking to a taxi driver in the local language.
It’s a neat two-way model: guests get a device and free services, while hotels get a powerful channel through which they can engage their guests.

All of this comes for free because hotels are sold on the idea that Handy can increase their engagement with guests, which translates to higher spending.
A hotelier’s dream is a guest who not only stays in their rooms regularly, but uses facilitates and services like the on-site spa, steak house or minibar. That’s the kind of guest who generates serious revenue.
Four-year-old Handy believes it can deliver on that mission.
It touts a two-year independent study which, it said, found that guests would spend an additional $21 per night on average when staying in a room that includes a Handy device.
Kwok told TechCrunch in an interview that typically 30 percent of guests who stay in a room with a Handy will engage with hotel information via the device. Compare that to your own experience — when was the last time you opened that gigantic book of hotel services?
The Tink Labs CEO reckons that less than 10 percent of guests go down the traditional route and open the book of services. That severely limits additional revenue than a hotel can make. Tink Labs charges hotels an undisclosed subscription fee — “it’s certainly nowhere near $21,” Kwok said — which can help them increase their revenue. That fee varies based on the requests of a hotel, though its important to note that hotels are forbidden from charging guests to use a Handy.
Tink Labs works with Foxconn to produce its devices, but it is changing things up with plans to introduce phones next year that it has designed itself. Right now its devices are fairly standard although they run on a “modified version of Android that is heavily, heavily customized,” Kwok said. He’s ready to takes things further and from April next year the company will give hotels bespoke devices under its own brand that can do things like control the TV set in a hotel room, and more.
Beyond developing specialist hardware, Kwok said he intends to triple the current team of 150 people and expand its reach of seven international offices to go after more hotel partners across the world.
Right now, the Handy service is in over 100 hotels with nearly one million people using Handy devices each month, the company said. It started off focused on Asia, and Kwok said Handy is present is half of the hotels in Singapore and Hong Kong, while its reach in London is at nearly 25 percent. The goal is now to expand that presence into other tourist and traveler spots and beyond.

344,Sarah Perez,"Airbnb may not be ready to unveil its new travel services app, Airbnb Trips, just yet, but in the meantime the company is giving its flagship application a big makeover. The upcoming version of the main Airbnb app will introduce a number of new features for hosts, including things like message templates for quicker replies and a calendar that lets them easily see who’s staying when, at what rate, and more.
The changes aren’t live immediately, the company says, but will rather roll out over the next couple of months.
The revamp itself was prompted by host feedback during last year’s Airbnb Open conference. Hosts said they heavily rely on the app because, often, hosting isn’t their full-time job. Instead, they manage much of their activity, including responding to incoming messages, while on the go, the company found.
With the new app, messaging will be featured more prominently and given a smart upgrade.

Where before, the Inbox was buried in the app’s navigation, requiring four clicks to access, it will now sit directly on the homescreen as the first button. In addition, hosts will be able to store responses to frequently asked questions in order to answer guests’ messages more quickly without having to type out responses on their phone’s small screen, or copy and paste from a saved document.
Instead, hosts can use these “message templates” to create pre-written responses to questions, like requests for directions, or those about the check-in and checkout times, requests for the Wi-Fi password, and more. In the messaging interface, a new option will let hosts pick one of these saved responses with a tap, which they can then choose to edit or just send through.
The app also lets hosts share photos through messaging, which brings it more on par with a true messaging experience.

In addition, the updated Airbnb app will include a new calendar feature that allows hosts to see their bookings through a variety of different views. For example, the “Overview” screen will show the dates that are booked and free for all their listings at a glance, while another screen lets you drill down into each booking to see more information.
Tabs at the top of this screen let you switch between a “month” view that will show the faces of the guest overlaid on their booked dates, while a “details” screen lets hosts see bookings, availability, and rates by day. You can even click into a day and toggle the availability on or off, and adjust the pricing.
Also of note, the app was built using Airbnb’s new Design Language System (DLS) which allows for rapid iteration, and a shared vocabulary across teams. It also aids the company in making a variety of products that will feel more connected to each other – something that could help if Airbnb chooses to launch a second application for travel services in the future, as previously reported.
This isn’t the first time Airbnb has made over its mobile app with the needs of hosts in mind – after all, guests only use the app on occasion, while active hosts may launch it daily.
A few years ago, Airbnb reimagined the app to allow hosts to answer messages, accept bookings, update their calendar, manage upcoming guests, and more, right from the mobile interface. This is also when it introduced the “Host Home” flow for adding listings to the platform without the need for a computer.
Airbnb says the new features will roll out on both iOS and Android over “the next couple of months.”",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/airbnb-app.jpg?w=738,"ios-apps,apps,mobile","Airbnb revamps its app with new tools for hosts, improved messaging"
345,Sarah Perez,"Although the iMessage App Store is currently dominated by sticker packs, there are a few clever apps breaking through. One such app is Momento, an iMessage-only app that automatically turns your photos from your Camera Roll into GIFs you can text to your friends. What makes the new app fun to use is that it doesn’t require that you do anything to create these GIFs yourself – it does that for you.
The app scans your photo library to figure out which photos will make good GIFs, then makes them available for sharing with just a tap.
Momento’s creator, Genady Okrain, says he wanted to build something that encourage people to go back to revisit their photo memories.
“As an amateur photographer, I have a lot of experience with photography. I’ve been amazed to see just how many photos people take,” he explains.
“All those photos are on people’s devices but no one is looking back on all of them. Momento creates cool GIFs from those photos and that help people remember those old moments,” says Okrain.

Using the app is simple. After downloading it from the iMessage App Store, you just tap the app when you want to add a GIF to your text message. Momento displays GIFs it has created for you to choose from.
It also groups these GIFs for easy access, with your most recent moments at the top of the screen. As you scroll down, you’ll find other GIFs organized into albums that mirror those in the Photos app. For example, there are sections for Favorites, Selfies, Bursts, and then an “All” group at the bottom.
To send a GIF, you just tap it and it’s added right into your text message. All you have to do is hit “Send.”
Okrain has released a handful of photo and navigation iOS apps on the App Store in the past, but this is his first iMessage application.
Of course, the iMessage App Store is still getting off the ground, so the app has seen limited downloads so far. iOS 10 is only on roughly 40% of devices, and not all of those who have upgraded to the new OS are even aware that Apple’s iMessage App Store exists at this point.
That said, Momento has already managed to snag some 800 downloads, despite being a paid application, and has since scanned around 10 million photos, says Okrain.
Although it’s $1.99 download, Momento is worth the price, as you’ll likely use this app a ton going forward. You can find the app here in the iMessage App Store.",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/momento.jpg?w=738,"imessage-apps,ios-apps,apps,momento",Momento for iMessage turns your photos into GIFs
346,Haje Jan Kamps,"Pullstring — née ToyTalk — today launched its eponymous product out of private beta and into the hands of creators of conversational interfaces everywhere. Out of the box, creators can make bots for Facebook Messenger, Slack, Skype, Kik, Telegram and — using the company’s Web API — pretty much every other platform out there.
The company’s authoring tools are presented as a desktop software package that will be available for the Mac OS X platform today and for Windows “coming soon.”
“This weekend, one of the best examples of chatbots we’ve seen so far launched as part of Channel 4’s Humans TV show,” says Oren Jacob, CEO at Pullstring. “It was going gangbusters, and is seeing a huge amount of engagement.”
Eager to check out the quality of the bot, I dove into the world of Persona Synthetics and am embarrassed to say that the time I was meant to be writing this article, I was instead having an intriguing conversation with a chatbot (try it out, it’s pretty awesome). Don’t get me wrong, the bot wouldn’t pass the Turing test, but trying to do so is a different field of computing, Jacob claims.
“I’ve often said that the characters are better defined by the things they can’t talk about, rather than what they know about,” Jacob complains. He draws the comparison that when you’re ordering a pizza from a pizza restaurant, you could start talking about hamburgers. A human operator would get exasperated, reminding you they’re a pizza restaurant. It makes sense for a bot to do the same. “What happens when a conversation drifts off topic is important. With Pullstring, we have created bots with a huge range. When you are talking with your bank about financial issues, for example, we have to keep the conversation tight and to the point. At the other extreme is our Hello Barbie product, where kids can talk about almost anything.”

The newly launched Pullstring, then, is the set of tools to help developers and content creators create compelling bots and conversational interfaces as quickly as possible. Most compellingly, perhaps, is that the interactions are self-learning. By using a combination of simple rules and a machine-learning AI, the bot can have conversations that are genuine and useful. Not only that, but machine learning can help having context-appropriate conversations.
“We worked with Activision Blizzard to help create a bot for Lt. Reyes, one of the characters in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,” Jacob tells me in an effort to explain the lengths the technology can go to in order to create an authentic vibe. “To get a genuine feel to the conversations, we pointed our AI at a large Call of Duty subreddit. We learned from the language used there to figure out how the gamers communicate together. As a result, the bot speaks in a similar way as the gamers would. We matched the tone and created a very credible experience.”
I haven’t played multiplayer games in a while, but one can only assume that the phrases “pwned” and various slurs were filtered out of the discourse. It worked great, though: Within the first 24 hours, more than 6 million chats were exchanged over Facebook Messenger, and the fans are eagerly awaiting the game’s launch in November.
Rules-based conversations are a great way to push a conversational product live; it is the bare bones of the experience. However, as millions of customers start having conversations, it becomes possible to learn from these interactions.
Pullstring’s platform includes metrics tools to help analyze how the conversational interface is performing. In addition to the obvious parts, such as warning the bot’s creators where in the conversations customers are getting stuck, there are ways of optimizing the conversations toward particular goals or outcomes.
The platform’s superpower, however, is that it remains context-aware across longer conversations, so a conversation you’re having with a customer is less likely to disappear into the weeds.
Gaming was an early adopter of Pullstring’s tech, including the company’s own Facebook Messenger and Skype game Humani, and a number of games aimed at younger children under the company’s ToyTalk brand. It would be a mistake to think this is all about entertainment, however.
“We have the ambition to create human-fidelity conversations,” explains Jacob. “We started in entertainment, but that’s not what this technology is primarily for. Our customers are constructing interactions in health, commerce, and much more.”

“Conversations are more than he-said-she-said,” Jacob says. “Much more. When you listen to a real conversation between two humans, there are a huge number of variables. A conversation is initiated with an intent: Someone wants to accomplish something. The content is important, too, of course. Together, they create a conversation.”
In addition to the actual words being said, the company goes deep into linguistics to simulate true conversations. Most importantly, then, there is the language-level interaction. A real conversation isn’t that person A finishes what they say, and person B listens carefully before giving a considered answer. It’s a game of back-and-forth, of interjections, queries, prompts and suggestions. This is ultimately what Pullstring is trying to help facilitate when you are having a conversation with your pizza parlor, your hairdresser or, potentially, the automated meter-maid that ticketed your car. Again.
With today’s launch, Pullstring offers both a DIY solution, where those wanting to author conversational interfaces can get started, or more managed, agency-style options.
“We have tutorials, sample code and sample e-commerce solutions,” says Lucas Ives, head of conversation engineering at Pullstring. He says that over the past five years of Pullstring, the company has learned more about getting computers to pose as human conversations than anyone else and that it is eager to maximize the knowledge transfer to its customers “There’s videos you can watch, a huge library of documentation and our support team is here to help, too.”
For larger accounts, the company continues to offer its agency model, where the company’s writers and content creators can work with in-house teams to create bots.
Pullstring’s authoring tools are available to everyone, starting today, and the company has an overview of its main features on the site.",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/humani.png?w=738,"oren-jacob,conversational-interface,conversational-commerce,pullstring",Pullstring launches bot-authoring tools for fun & profit
347,Jonathan Shieber,"Alphabet, Apple and Uber may be spending billions on exhaustive new mapping technologies to power the self-driving car revolution, but there’s a new generation of companies betting that a combination of crowdsourcing and artificial intelligence will enable them to navigate their way to success in the wild world of international geographics.
Some companies are choosing to go deep into the haphazard images they’re collecting from crowd-sourced contributors, while others are using artificial intelligence and a vast network of connected vehicles to share information about road hazards, and pave the way for true autonomous cars.
Mapillary is one of these companies looking to go their own way. With only $8.5 million in venture financing (admittedly from big names like Sequoia Capital), the company is looking to beat the big boys at their own game — or at least convince one of the big boys to buy them for a handsome sum.

Mapillary crowd-sources images from a network of contributors in much the same way that Waze relies on drivers for information. What differentiates the company is the depth of analysis of the images it receives.
“We’re labeling all the regions and objects and making that available,” says Jan Erik Solem, the Mapillary chief executive, of the company’s first real product offering. It’s a process called semantic segmentation.
The business model for the company is selling map data from the images they collect. On its face, the model seems somewhat similar to the business at CityMaps, which was recently bought for a tidy (if undisclosed) sum earlier this year.
However, there’s another side to the business that’s closer to the heart of the autonomous driving vehicle experiment. The company is actually working with UC Berkeley on the university’s DeepDrive initiative.
“To date…. we have almost 2 million kilometers,” said Solem. “It’s about 15% to 20% of what Google has. We launched two-and-a-half years ago… and we’re not spending a billion dollars a year. The ambition here is to have different coverage.”

The depth of coverage that Mapillary can provide ostensibly can give the company a different view of the world than Google’s mapping features, according to Solem.
“Every system you train is going to be biased based on the inputs,” said Solem. “The out put is directly correlated to the input… You can train a system in the U.S. but it’s not going to be the same in the rest of the world… If you don’t have a tuk tuks in your training sets on the streets in Michigan, you’re not going to detect a tuk tuk on a street in India.”
Earlier this week, the German company HERE launched its first product in partnership with its co-owners — the European automakers, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen.
According to an initial report from Reuters, the three German automakers will share data to provide information on traffic conditions ranging from accidents or traffic stops to poor road construction, to even street-side parking.
The information will come from data input from thousands of live traffic feeds from cameras integrated into the cars’ display and navigation systems.
That bombshell is the first indication of why so man companies were fighting over HERE’s navigation technologies when Nokia carved it out and sold it to the three automakers for $3.1 billion in the latter part of last year.
In the U.S., competition for HERE’s data services are a bit more early-stage… more in the vein of Mapillary than the German behemoth. CivilMaps, backed by Ford, raised $6.6 million to pursue a somewhat similar technology.
Meanwhile, competitors like Google aren’t taking the challenge of new functionality from a band fo startups at face value (or their last valuations). In Google’s case, that means the acquisition earlier this month of Urban Engines.
“There are certain situations that [the AI] can’t handle because they haven’t built that into the machine from the start,” said Solem, “and to build that in they have to have training.”
That’s why local data is so important, and may represent the next trail blazed on the road to full autonomous vehicles.",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/screen-shot-2013-11-15-at-15-12-42.png?w=738,"software,technology,business",Mapping startups hope they can chart a new course to success

It in fact announced two phones, Apple style. The Mi 5s Plus and Mi 5s were both unveiled today as follow-ups to Xiaomi’s flagship Mi 5 which came out earlier this year. Dual camera aside, the devices both include a fingerprint scan which is contained under the front glass. Xiaomi said the technology “recognizes a 3D map of each user’s fingerprint through ultrasonic waves” meaning that it can sit on the front of the phone without a need for a physical button.
Both devices will be available in China from September 29. The Mi 5s (which is 5.15-inches) will be priced from 1999 RMB ($299) while the larger 5.7-inch Mi 5s Plus will cost upwards of 2299 RMB ($345).
The devices are both powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, but the Pro clocks higher and features 6GB RAM and 128GB storage, while the Mi 5s packs 3GB RAM and 64GB storage as standard with a more expensive combination of 4GB RAM and 128GB storage for 2299 RMB. Likewise, a higher specc’ed version of the Mi 5s Pro will feature 6GB RAM and 128GB storage for 2599 RMB, that’s around $390.
Beyond the internals, the cameras are the most obvious difference here — like the new iPhones. The Mi 5s comes with a 13-megapixel Sony IMX 378 shooter, while the Pro sports two of the same. Xiaomi said that they work in tandem, with one lens capturing images in color and the other in black and white only to produce clearer images with less noise and more detail.
As is often the case with new Xiaomi products, we don’t have details on international availability yet, but we’d expect that, as a flagship series, they won’t remain limited to China.
Xiaomi also outed its newest smart TV — the Mi TV 3s — today. It said the latest version includes AI technology which classifies content and remembers preferences, helping to serve up personalized programing for users. Xiaomi has also added content from Tencent Video for the first time, which is in addition to existing deals with iQiyi and Youku, two of China’s biggest video content portals.

349,Josh Constine,"If you combined the fastest and slowest types of social media, the result could be both must-see and never-forgotten.
YouTube lacks short-form, frequently updated content, but is synonymous with video and that popularity brings in lucrative ads. Twitter is struggling with growth and monetization, but it’s the pulse of the planet, generating tons of real-time content and engagement.
Together they could be a powerful team if Google’s willing to pay the price, which Kara Swisher reports could be around $30 billion.
Twitter is also in talks with Verizon, Salesforce, and Microsoft, TechCrunch reported following a story by CNBC about Twitter’s interest in selling out. And Disney is considering a bid too.
But of all those potential acquirers, Google seems like the best fit. It has products that would mesh well with Twitter. It’s proven unable to build its own successful social products beyond its acquisition of YouTube. And it has its insanely profitable search advertising business to support the financially unstable Twitter.
Google would get to further its goal of organizing the world’s information by ingesting Twitter’s data firehose, which could give Google’s AI extra insights into what’s going on in the world and everyone’s reactions. Plus it might be able to monetize all that data better by combining Twitter with everything Google knows from AdWords and AdSense.
But the best synergy lies in uniting YouTube’s sporadic video content with Twitter’s constant chatter. A strong integration into YouTube could  increase the frequency of return visits to the channels of content creators by offering a one-stop-shop for fandom, encompassing off-the-cuff tweets and polished videos.
And it just so happens that YouTube recently built its own Twitter-style feature called YouTube Community that it could replace with the real thing.
YouTube Community is a sidebar/tab for YouTube Channels that lets creators share text, photos, GIFs, links, and more to stoke a deeper form of connection with their viewers. The strategy is to get users to come back to those channels more often than just when the creator publishes a new video, which might only be once or twice a week. With all of YouTube’s algorithmic suggestions, it could then get those visitors to watch other new videos or older ones by their favorite stars.
That would allow YouTube to better compete with Facebook, which has built an enormous audience for spontaneous video discovery. Users come to the News Feed to see what’s up with friends, but end up watching random videos. That gives Facebook lots of opportunities to serve high-priced video ads, since users weren’t trying to watch something specific anyways. YouTube has historically been more of purposeful viewing destination that users visit because they followed a link to a certain video or wanted to see the latest clip from creators they follow.
Meanwhile, Twitter could dramatically benefit from exposure to YouTube’s mainstream and teen audiences. Many people are still confused about why they would want to sign up for Twitter, especially if they’re not a public figure and might not be able to build a big audience for their tweets. But YouTube could teach them the joys of Twitter lurking, where users follow stars or thought leaders and perhaps reply, but don’t necessarily have to produce original tweets.

An acquisition by Google would also take the pressure off Twitter to monetize directly, which hasn’t been going well with revenue growth sinking fast. Many of Twitter’s ad units, like Sponsored Tweets, feel easily skippable.
People already skim rather than meticulously read their Twitter timeline, making it easier to pass by the ads than ones on Facebook, where algorithmic sorting and a focus on real friends encourages people to read each post — and the ads in between. Twitter’s best performing ads are videos, and YouTube’s experience and advertiser connections could give them a boost.
In any case, something has to change for Twitter. Except for investors trying to capitalize on a potential sale, its share price has sunk lower and lower. Each earnings report has seemed more hopeless than the last as a user growth problem has festered into a revenue growth problem. Some fresh management and cross-promotion from a proven tech giant like Google could mend its wings.",2016-09-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/google-acquires-twitter.png?w=738,,"If Google buys Twitter, there’s a perfect spot for it in YouTube"

351,Darrell Etherington,"Google is planning hybrid devices that run both Android and Chrome OS, including one convertible laptop, and one Huawei Nexus-branded tablet, according to a new report from 9to5Google. The report backs up another from Android Police today that says a convertible notebook is on the way.
The Andromeda project bakes Chrome OS features into Android, giving you the best of both worlds in one place, according to early reports. This would make a lot of sense for a thin, convertible laptop device like the so-called “Pixel 3” that Android Police reported this morning, which is set to be launched in Q3 2017, and which will potentially boast a 12.3-inch touchscreen display.
The report claims this won’t be a lightweight Chromebook-style machine on the specs side — it will have either an i3 or i5 Intel core processor, 128GB of onboard storage and either 8GB or 16GB of RAM. They also suggest it’ll get two USB-C ports, and stylus support for a separate Wacom-enabled pen accessory, which would suggest capable, advanced pressure-sensitive abilities for drawing and graphics.
Such a hybrid would be very interesting from Google, and something that could potentially prove a model for power down-market devices aimed at education and even enterprise use, if they can demonstrate desktop power via the Chrome OS features alongside Android’s mobile convenience. This first device will likely be priced higher and aimed at a higher echelon of consumers, however.
9to5Google’s report of the dedicated tablet suggests that the company is thinking about how to make the Andromeda experience work on mobile-first hardware. I’d personally like to see this come to Android smartphones, too, as it could be a better answer to the one-device-to-rule-them-all problem that Microsoft made a faint attempt at solving with Windows 10 and its ability to plug into external displays for a more traditional desktop experience.
It’s not clear whether we’ll see evidence of these at the October 4 event Google is planning, and, given the launch timelines, it wouldn’t necessarily make sense. But there should be plenty else to see next Tuesday, including new rumored Pixel-branded Android phones.",2016-09-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/f101_pixel2_silver_playstore.png?w=738,,"Google said to debut Android/Chrome OS hybrid on tablet, convertible notebook"
352,Darrell Etherington,"You’ve likely seen the headlines about consumer frustration with the transition to EMV payment cards in the U.S., most of which centers around how long the payments take versus good old-fashioned swiping. Those of us living in countries where EMV has been a fixture for a while might just shrug at this, but not Square: It’s focused on cutting transaction times to alleviate customer impatience, and it now boasts a 4.2-second total time from when you put your card in the reader to when you’ve successfully checked out.
This is one of those things that seems small, but in aggregate could have a big impact on customer satisfaction at the register, and Square says it’s focused on bringing that time down further still, to hopefully achieve a 3-second total transition time. Indeed, 4.2 seconds is already 25 percent faster than its previous low of 5.7 seconds, so Square says it’s making good progress.
It’s now been one year since the U.S. shifted liability for card-related fraud from card issuers to merchants, which prompted the widespread adoption of EMV. Square says it’s seen the number of cards with chips processed via Square in the U.S. jump from 40 percent a year ago to 75 percent today, meaning it’s essentially reaching saturation.",2016-09-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/reader-04-b12e271801dbb3662ea9526c33ae8d34.jpg?w=738,"chip-cards,emv,square",Square hopes to ease the EMV transition with faster transaction times
353,Sarah Perez,"Remember ThingMaker? Mattel’s $300 3D printer that would let kids print out their own toys? Its ship date – which was supposed to be this month – just got pushed back another year, according to a report from Engadget. The toy maker says it needs the extra time to “enhance the digital functionality” in order to deliver the “most engaging” experience for its customers.
The 3D printer was first unveiled earlier this year at New York’s toy fair, and immediately drew a lot of interest. The relatively low-cost device works alongside an app that offers a simple interface for designing items – like dolls, robots and dinosaurs – that could then come to life through the 3D printing process.
After using the software to customize the toys with different colors and textures, kids would then export the STL print files to Mattel’s printer. Mattel had said the ThingMaker 3D would use a hard PLA filament in printing, and it was shown at the toy fair with toys made using some two dozen colors.

The device would actually print out the parts in batches, then the individual pieces would be assembled through ball-and-socket joints that snap together. This process was said to take anywhere from 30 minutes for a small item, up to overnight (e.g. 6 to 8 hours) for a larger toy.
The launch was meant to connect the toy company with consumers’ newer interest in the maker movement. It name references Mattel’s original at-home maker device from the 1960’s, which let kids build toys like flowers or “Creepy Crawlers” by pouring a liquid, plastic-like material called Plastigoop into molds. ThingMaker was meant to take that concept of kids making their own toys to the modern era of 3D printing and mobile applications.
Unfortunately, home toy-making will have to wait.
A Mattel spokesperson gave us the following statement on the delay:
This makes it sound like the software, not hardware, is to blame for the delay. Asked for more details, a spokesperson would only say that the team is “improving the software for a better user experience, and ensuring that the platform will grow with user and technology needs down the road.”
Amazon began taking pre-orders for the printer back in February. Those who had jumped to place their order were promised ship dates of late October.
However, it’s worth noting that you may not immediately see this delay reflected on your Amazon order page, which still shows the shipment is pending:

354,Matt Burns,"The Electronic Frontier Foundation has called on HP to restore customer’s ability to use third-party ink cartridges in its Office Jet printers. It is also urging consumers to sign a petition, which as of this posts’s publication, has nearly 7,500 signatures.
In an open letter to HP Inc. President and CEO, Dion Weisler, activist Cory Doctorow calls on the company to take five steps immediately including apologizing to its customers and resorting the original functionality to its printers. HP seemingly knowingly activated the printer ink DRM under the guise of a security update, simultaneously removing features from its printers and violating the trust of its customers.
Last week HP pushed an update to its line of Office Jet printers. It was called a security update. However, upon installing, users quickly discovered that the printer would no longer work with third-party or recycled ink cartridges — only new HP cartridges worked.
Doctorow notes in his letter to HP’s CEO, removing an ability is a bait-and-switch tactic. HP had publicly announced a software update would be implemented that would restrict printer cartridge use. HP made this announcement in March, but the update was not pushed until September. HP knew for at least six months customers were buying a printer that would eventually no longer support a major feature — compatibility with third-party cartridges.
After releasing the update, HP issued a statement saying the purpose of this update was to protect the company’s innovations and intellectual property.

355,Jon Russell,"Hot on the heels of the launch of the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple’s first smartphone with dual reverse-facing cameras, China’s Xiaomi has joined the double camera club with Mi 5s Plus announced today.
It in fact announced two phones, Apple style. The Mi 5s Plus and Mi 5s were both unveiled today as follow-ups to Xiaomi’s flagship Mi 5 which came out earlier this year. Dual camera aside, the devices both include a fingerprint scan which is contained under the front glass.

356,Matt Burns,"Plex is a pirate’s best friend. It’s by far the best way to get movies downloaded illegally from the computer to TV. Sure, Plex has a handful of useful, legal features, but let’s be honest, its big claim to fame is hosting and serving downloaded movies. And now the company behind the software announced a service where users can stream movies, photos and music stored on Amazon’s cloud as if the content was streamed locally.
But don’t tell Amazon about the pirated stuff.
The Plex Cloud, as the new service is called, got a fair amount of coverage when it launched earlier today. On the surface it’s exciting. No longer would users have to constantly run and maintain local servers to host. Plex Cloud essentially lets users create their own Netflix. All the movies and photos and music are hosted in the cloud — the same cloud Netflix uses, actually — and they’re called down to devices on demand. Even the Plex server software is streamed from the cloud.
Users just have to pay the $60 yearly fee for unlimited storage on Amazon Web Services. And this is where it gets hairy. Amazon explicitly bans users from hosting infringing content on its servers — content such as downloaded movies.
I haven’t tried the service yet, though Plex offered to get me a beta pass as soon as they’re available. I expect it will work even with movies downloaded from The Pirate Bay and countless other sites. Amazon Web Services does not prevent users from uploading such content. But AWS will likely remove it as soon as it’s identified.
Amazon is not alone in this stance. Uploading such content to cloud services has long been a point of debate. Some users feel as long as the content is not publicly shared or advertised, the content will run under the radar of Amazon, Google, and the rest of the cloud providers.
Plex’s stance on uploading illegal content to AWS is predictable: “Those who use Plex Cloud should abide by the Terms of Use of both Plex and Amazon,” a company spokesperson told me when asked specific questions about AWS’s policies around downloaded movies.
Even operating in a gray area, Plex Cloud is an interesting step in personal computing. It removes the need for personal infrastructure to achieve the same outcome as if the Plex software was running on a home computer. And this is the promise of cloud computing.
As for the Plex Cloud, if I relied on Plex to serve downloaded movies and TV shows to my family, I would keep that content stored safely and privately on a server in my basement next to the crock pot and Halloween decorations. If I did such a thing. But I don’t.",2016-09-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/warning-cloud1.png?w=738,"amazon-com,cloud-computing,computing",Movie pirate?

358,Darrell Etherington,"If you’re at all interested in retro gaming, you’ve probably come across 8Bitdo, the company that makes throwback Bluetooth controllers inspired by classics like the SNES and NES. Now, it’s paying homage to another classic, the Apple II.
The company’s new Kickstarter project seeks funding for a game controller called the AP40, featuring a full load-out of buttons, analog joysticks and compatibility with a number of devices. But what’s special about the controller is its design, which takes cues from the case designs of hardware like the Apple II, and borrows its color scheme from the multicolored Apple logo that adorned the case of the classic Mac.

There’s even a silicon green leaf that plugs into the micro USB port the controller uses for charging, and an aluminum stand accessory takes design cues from the Apple II, complete with a decorative keyboard and slot for holding your smartphone or tablet.

The AP40 has the same compatibility range and limitation as other 8Bitdo controllers, which means that it’s not MFI and therefore not compatible with iOS games that rely on Apple’s native game controller APIs, or with the Apple TV. It does work with iCade-enable iOS games, however, and it also works out of the box with Macs, Windows, Android, Wii, PlayStation 3, RetroN5 and Raspberry Pi running Recallbox.
Also up for funding is a Retro Receiver designed for use with the Apple II/IIc, which will let people who own that classic computer use the AP40 to play games. The controller also works with the company’s Retro Receivers for NES and SNES, adding compatibility to those classic consoles.
Pricing for the AP40 starts at US$49, and the company hopes to ship to backers beginning in January, 2017. Luckily for potential backers, 8Bitdo has a good reputation and has proven it can handle manufacturing this kind of device at scale.",2016-09-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/00dc350ba5ba3cb5ac2160a8d443db92_original.jpg?w=680,game-controller,This new Bluetooth game controller celebrates classic Macs
359,Sarah Perez,"Confirming earlier leaks, Roku this morning unveiled a refreshed and rebranded line of streaming media players, with the intent of plugging every hole in the market. Instead of numbering the Roku devices as before, the new streamers use names like “Express” for the entry-level devices up to “Ultra” for the high-end player, and focus on consumers’ particular interests when buying, whether that’s price point, portability, better picture quality, port availability, and more.
According to Roku CMO Matthew Anderson, the decision to move away from the numerical scheme was because it implied that the higher numbers were the newer players. “If the latest is the highest number, that works. But if you’re doing something disruptive at the bottom, it’s hard to call it ‘1’ again,” he says.

Roku Express & Express+
At the low-end, the new Roku Express will replace the Roku 1, but will offer an upgraded experience. The new device is 75% smaller than the earlier model, supports 1080p HD streaming, and Roku has doubled the processing power in the chip. This boost means the player software will respond more quickly than before, and generally feel snappier.
It’s priced aggressively, too, at $29.99, which makes it a compelling choice for those considering shopping for a stick like Chromecast or Amazon Fire TV Stick, simply because of price point.

An Express+ model ($39.99) also ships with a composite cable in addition to the HDMI cable, as it’s designed to work with older TVs you want to upgrade to a smart TV. Roku felt this was need currently being overlooked in today’s streaming player landscape, noting there are 40 to 50 million TVs that don’t have HDMI ports here in the U.S.
Meanwhile, both Express models also ship with an IR remote, but it doesn’t support private listening through the headphone jack. However, the Roku iOS and Android app offers private listening and voice search for Express owners.
Roku Stick
The Roku Stick ($49.99) is also still available for those who want to be able to move their Roku between TVs – helpful for those traveling, or who occasionally watch in different rooms. It includes dual-band MIMO wireless, an included remote, supporting for casting video from Netflix and YouTube apps to the TV, and is the only stick with a quad-core processor. That means it’s 8 times more powerful than the prior model.
Premiere and Premiere+ 
In the mid-tier, the former Roku 2 will become the Roku Premiere and Premiere+ instead, priced at $79.99 and $99.99, respectively. These two devices will focus on meeting the needs of consumers who are most interested in better picture quality.

Roku says 55 million 4K TVs will be sold this year, and that number will grow to 120 million by 2020.
The Premiere is the device aimed at this segment of the market, by offering with 4K support at 60fps. The increased speed means a smoother image when watching video with action, like sports. It’s also meant to rival other 4K players, like Amazon’s Fire TV which offers 4K at 30fps, for example. (Apple TV’s latest model doesn’t support 4K video either, but it looks like the next model might.)
The Premiere+ will add HDR support in addition to 4K, and ship with a high-end, “point anywhere” remote with a headphone jack versus the Premiere’s standard IR remote. HDR improves the picture quality further, by bringing more detail to the brightest and darkest areas of scenes by expanding the range of color and contrast of the images.
The Premiere line can also upscale 720p to 1080p on HDTVs, and 720p or 1080p to 4K up to 60fps on 4K UHD TVs.
The Premiere+ also adds a few ports, like Ethernet and a microSD slot, while both devices include a quad-core processor and support for 802.11ac MIMO dual-band wireless.
Ultra
Finally, at the top of the lineup is the Roku Ultra. This player has everything, including 4K and HDR support, the ability to upscale videos like the Premiere,a quad-core processor, 802.11ac dual-band wireless, and Dolby Digital/Dolby Digital Plus for surround sound in home theaters.
It also offers Ethernet, microSD, optical digital audio out port for receivers and soundbars, and a USB port.
Its high-end remote has the headphone jack for private listening, voice search support, the lost remote finder feature, and gaming buttons.

Night Listening Mode & Better Search
The Roku software is also getting an upgrade at this time as well.
Premiere and Ultra owners, will have access to a new “night listening mode,” which will address that annoying problem where you’re constantly turning the volume up and down on action films because the dialog is quiet, but the action scenes and explosions are loud. This is something parents stress over quite a bit, as they’re trying to watch movies after their little ones are in bed, but also would be ideal for any other situation where you don’t want to blast your TV for all your housemates to hear.
With night listening mode, Roku will bring the two audio tracks closer together, so you don’t have to keep fiddling with the volume.

In addition, Roku can now search across over 100 channels, and has been tweaked to help you better find content in specific genres like comedy, cooking, sports, and music. For example, if you searched for a comedian’s name, you wouldn’t just find the movies he starred in, but also things like a guest appearance on SNL, stand-up specials, if he’s credited with narrating a movie, and more.
Search is available across all models and is backwards-compatible.
The new devices are available for pre-order on Roku.com, and will ship in October. They’ll hit the major retailers, like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others, in October as well.",2016-09-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/roku_img_9564_remote.jpg?w=738,,Roku unveils its new line of streaming players
360,Josh Constine,"Unless you plan on bumping into stuff, don’t expect to record after-dark concerts and parties on your Snap Inc Spectacles. The company formerly known as Snapchat (they really should have just changed it to the 👻 emoji, Prince-style) confirms to me its new camera glasses are not currently built to be worn at night. Their lenses are like normal sunglasses, so it’d be too shady to see with them on.
This fact reinforces the idea of Spectacles as “a toy”. That’s how Snap CEO Evan Spiegel referred to them while talking to the Wall Street Journal, which never mentioned they’re for day-use only.

When the $130 Specs are released this fall, you might have to stick to barbecues and day-time music festivals when you want to tap the rim of your glasses to record 10 seconds of circular, first-person video.
Perhaps future iterations could come with clear lenses or photochromatic light-adaptive lenses that are dark in the sun and transparent at night or indoors. By ditching extra functionality to keep the price reasonable, Snapchat may be able to market the glasses as an aspirational buy for its teen user base. That will go smoother if it can align Spectacles with celebrities people want to emulate.

The first version of Spectacles might not be as transformational of a technology as some hoped. Yet it gives Snapchat more control of the image capture and saving experience. With time, engineering, and product finesse, Specs could evolve into something we see ourselves wearing whenever we go somewhere we want to share.

361,Haje Jan Kamps,"There’s no denying that your smartphone’s camera is getting better and better for every generation, but what’s a poor photography nerd to do about controllability? Miggo’s Kickstarter-funded Pictar is shipping soon, and might be just the thing to teach your iPhone some additional photography skills. At Photokina, I had a chance to try it myself.
“Smartphones have great cameras,” says Sean Henry, the photography industry veteran who brought Pictar to life. “But for advanced users, the functions are either hidden or hard to get to.”
Pictar is a fantastically clever solution to that precise problem. It adds a grip with a shutter button and three control wheels to the iPhone. One of the wheels controls the zoom, one is programmable to a number of different functions, and the last is an exposure compensation wheel. The shutter button includes focus / exposure lock on a half-press much like you would find on traditional cameras. And, of course, it takes a photo when you depress the button fully.

Pictar is one of those rare products that I never really knew I needed in my life until I tried it myself. Yes, it seems dumb and it is so easy to write it off as a gimmick… But you’d be wrong to do that until you’ve tried it. I’ve certainly never felt I needed a real shutter button on my phone. Having said that, the feeling of relief of being able to make adjustments by turning wheels rather than having to do complicated multi-touch or touch-and-hold maneuvers is strong. As a photographer, the product makes the iPhone feel like a much more capable piece of photographic kit, which is a remarkable accomplishment by Miggo.
All of that isn’t to say that the product is completely perfect; the button-press for the shutter button felt a bit stiff compared to what you find even on an entry-level compact camera, and it’s hard to know by feel whether or not you’ve succeeded in doing a half-press. The turn wheels also felt a bit cheap — cheaper than its $120 price tag would indicate. If there’s ever a second version of it, I hope the manufacturers either drop the price or increase the feel of the product to be more in line with the phones it is designed to contain.
“We are shipping in December,” Henry confirms. “If you want one as soon as possible, pre-order sooner rather than later!”",2016-09-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/20160924-_dsc3356.jpg?w=738,"photokina-2016,smartphone-accessories,miggo","Hands-on with Pictar, which adds buttons and wheels to your iPhone camera"
362,Lora Kolodny,"A Santa Monica-based startup called AirMap today launched a feature that gives drone operators real time traffic alerts whenever manned aircraft such as helicopters, crop dusters or low-flying passenger planes, are about to enter into their air space.
The company’s systems, generally, let drone makers and developers of drone apps give users maps and guidance as to where they’re welcome to fly, and what airspace is off-limits or unsafe.
AirMap analyzes data on the laws, traffic and obstacles in the sky around the world, and can help drones safely navigate the skies over any country, according to co-founder and CEO Ben Marcus.
The company offers a standalone app, API and software development kit to hardware and software makers who want to create sophisticated maps and real-time data overlays within their own products.
“We look at 1,000s of manned aircraft simultaneously and drones simultaneously to figure out which will create a potential intersection,” Marcus explained. (The algorithms and architecture required to create AirMap’s real-time traffic alerts sound like an SAT math question run incredibly amok.)
Along with the new feature launch, AirMap also announced data partnerships with Stamford, Connecticut-based Passur Aerospace Inc., and Palo Alto-based uAvionix.
Passur Aerospace operates a large network of ground-based systems that use radar and other sensor technologies to detect the presence of manned aircraft overhead.
UAvionix makes lightweight ADS-B sensors and systems that are installed in drones, and allow sharing of information between manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles.
The data partnerships helped AirMap make its real time traffic alerts a reality, Marcus said.
Gregory McNeal, AirMap co-founder and a law professor at Pepperdine University, is delivering the afternoon keynote at the Interdrone conference in Las Vegas today, and plans to call for continued collaboration in the burgeoning drones industry to usher in an era of pervasive, safe and beneficial drone use.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/airmap_realtime_alerts.png?w=738,"airspace-management,drones,uas,uavs",New AirMap feature helps drones avoid manned aircraft
363,Ron Miller,"Last Fall, rumors began circulating that Dell was interested in acquiring EMC. On October 12th, the rumors proved true when Dell announced it was buying EMC for an astonishing $67 billion, a record price for a tech acquisition. Almost a year later, for better or worse (richer or poorer), that deal is official today.
While the parties might like to frame this as a deal with little drama, the truth is that Dell faced several major legal and regulatory hurdles along with EMC and VMware stock holder skepticism along the way, but last week when Chinese authorities gave the go-ahead, the deal was finally all-systems-go.
Now comes the hard work of integrating the two companies. What remains to be seen is whether this is ultimately a good deal for Dell, and if it can mold the two organization into a cohesive operation. There are certainly no guarantees here.
When you pay a record price, you are going to attract attention, and not all of it is going to be positive. Regulators and investors alike had lots of questions and it didn’t take long for problems to crop up.
Part of the problem is the way EMC is structured. Unlike most big corporations with internal divisions operating under a single corporate structure with a single stock, EMC is a federation of affiliated and sometimes independent companies. Chief among them is VMware, the virtualization giant, which is run as an entirely separate company to the point of being its own publicly traded stock.
VMware stockholders didn’t take kindly to the deal, at least initially, and the share price began to plunge from $82.09 a share on the day before the sale was announced, all the way down to $43.84 on February 9th, its post-announcement low point. After that, the stock began to recover slowly but steadily, and as of Tuesday, the price had rebounded all the way back to $73.39 a share. That recovery had to be an enormous relief for Dell executives and its financial backers because VMware is an important piece of this puzzle. EMC, and by extension Dell, owns 80 percent of the company, and the larger deal was structured in an unusual way that makes VMware extra important.
Dell agreed to pay EMC shareholders $24.05 per share. In addition, it agreed to pay what’s called a tracking stock, an amount that tracks against the share price of VMware. As the stock price dropped, it made the provision less valuable and shareholders increasingly nervous. With the stock price back close to its pre-acquisition announcement level, this should no longer be an issue.
Another key independent piece is Pivotal, a company launched in a partnership involving EMC, VMware and GE, which helps companies become more digitally focussed. It announced a massive $650 million influx of outside funding from the likes of Ford and Microsoft last spring, and rumors have been circulating that it could go public at some point. While that’s not necessarily a bad thing, it did add another level of difficulty in getting the deal to the finish line.
Shortly after the deal was announced, EMC and VMware announced that they were spinning out Virtustream, a company EMC bought for $1.2 billion in May, 2015, as yet another quasi-independent piece. The new company will help customers manage their cloud operations, whether public, private or hybrid — no doubt, an attractive piece for Dell — but the deal quickly ran into trouble as already-agitated VMware stockholders began to balk, unhappy that the new company’s financials would be reported as part of VMware’s earnings. Two months later, VMware walked away from their part of the ownership stake. EMC decided to go it alone, but it certainly raised eyebrows at the time.
There were also questions about how the deal would be taxed, and how Dell, the smaller of the two companies would pay such a huge debt load, reported to be in the $40 billion range (which is why it has to feel pretty good about that recovering VMware stock price).
In January, VMware and EMC announced layoffs ahead of the deal being finalized in separate actions. There are sure to be more to come as the two organizations consolidate and get rid of redundant positions. The good news is that the two companies product lines are quite complementary without a lot of overlap.
In spite of the issues, the deal edged steadily forward, and today it’s finally complete. The combining of the two companies is mostly seen in a positive light by industry observer’s because along with a strong enterprise storage component, EMC could give Dell an avenue into the valuable hybrid cloud computing market. Many of the traditional technology vendors like HPE, Dell, Cisco and VMware; wary of the growing power of AWS (and to some extent Microsoft and Google) in the public cloud have tried to take a different approach by offering companies a private cloud — that is, the ability to run like a public cloud with all that entails around self-provisioning and billing based on usage, but in the comfort and security (at least theoretically) of a private data center.
Beyond that, there is a realization that companies are in the cloud already today, and more likely than not, over the next decade (or more) will run some combination of their workloads in the public cloud and some in the private data center — otherwise known as the hybrid cloud.
Dell thinks that by teaming with EMC, it can capture a substantial piece of that lucrative market, even as its server business begins to slip with the rest of the market. Gartner had mixed news for server vendors like Dell in its June report with shipments up 1.7 percent, but revenue down 2.3 percent. IDC’s June report was even worse with revenue down 3.6 percent in its survey.
While it will take some time to truly sort out the winners and losers in this deal, the consensus is that Dell did well to grab EMC, even at that exorbitant price.
Oracle chairman Larry Ellison was an enthusiastic supporter, saying he shed more than a few tears that he couldn’t offer a rival bid because Oracle has been tied up with its own transition to cloud computing. He believes the price was a bargain and Dell and its investors could make a substantial amount of money when all is said and done.
Alan Pelz-Sharpe, an analyst with Digital Clarity Group, isn’t quite as bullish on the deal as Ellison, but he still likes what he sees, especially in terms of long-term stability for the two companies. “Margins in the hardware world are tight and likely always will be, but it’s still big business. Taking EMC out of the publicly traded world and into Dell’s private world provides a relatively stable environment to consolidate and ultimately achieve some kind of long-term growth,” he said.
Glenn O’Donnell, an analyst with Forrester sees the real value for Dell in the independent pieces in the EMC federation — VMware, Pivotal and Virtustream. He also likes the impact of the deal on Dell’s cash flow. “EMC produces a whopping $5.5B in free cash flow, sweet music to a private company like Dell.”
While the consensus is that it will all work out eventually, combining two companies the size of Dell and EMC is going to take a substantial amount of time to pull off. The politics will likely be stunning and getting both companies moving as one is going to be a huge organizational challenge.
In the meantime, while they struggle with that monumental transition, their competition will be moving forward. Dell and EMC are bigger together and provide a wider breadth of enterprise offerings, but can they can continue to innovate while pulling together a deal like this — and offloading some pieces to help pay for it? It’s an awful lot to juggle and it will take time to judge if it was worth the substantial investment Dell made to get EMC in the fold.
Regardless, it’s going to be up to the two companies to figure out how to make this all work, and ready or not, the future starts now.
Note: According to Dell PR, the actual  deal value is $58.1B based on the value of the cash consideration and opening price of DVMT ($45.07).  The original value when the deal was announced  was $67 billion.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/dell-emc.png?w=738,"mergers-and-acquisitions,emc,dell-emc-deal",$67 billion Dell-EMC deal closes today
364,Ron Miller,"When Box praised its partnership with IBM at its earnings call last week, it was holding one card close the vest. The two companies had been working on a new workflow tool, and today they announced Box Relay ahead of the BoxWorks customer conference this week in San Francisco.
Workflow tools fall under the realm of Business Process Management (BPM) in the enterprise. They typically involve stringing together a series of complicated activities, often crossing a number of different systems, to keep work moving along in organized and automated way. Think an insurance claim or a hospital stay, where there are a series of generally complex steps required to complete a process.
The goal of everyone in the room with this project was to remove the complexity inherent in today’s traditional BPM tools, giving line of business users control over the process, while allowing sophisticated kinds of workflows you see from BPM in settings such as insurance, financial services or healthcare.
The problem as both Box and IBM saw it, was that BPM always required IT to create a workflow, and that includes Box Workflow, introduced two years ago at BoxWorks. That usually meant the big important processes got automated, while the kind of project-oriented workflows line-of-business users want to set up were left to more ad hoc methods like email, spreadsheets or even sticky notes and white boards. Having IT deal with those kinds of activities was simply too expensive and time-consuming for less essential processes.
That’s why the number one goal with this project was to put regular business users in control. Besides taking IT out of the equation, the team had a few other objectives in mind including making it dead simple to create and launch a workflow, being able to track the progress of the workflow in real time and using the tool as a central place for teams to collaborate in the cloud (and that could even includes folks from outside of the enterprise).
In theory, any employee can build a workflow using a wizard interface by following a series of steps that could touch any number of applications outside of Box, such as DocuSign for electronic signature, Office 365 for documents, Salesforce to update or access the customer record and so forth.
After you have a workflow in place, you can track the progress in a project dashboard, seeing which parts of the project are moving smoothly and where there are bottlenecks or hold-ups. You can even set up the system to send you notifications if there is an issue in the workflow.
This ability to build workflows easily creates real separation from the file sync and share pack, says Alan Pelz-Sharpe, an analyst with Digital Clarity Group. “This is in my opinion easily their most important release to date as it moves Box from a shared library of sorts to a quality platform that can be used to run a plethora of basic business processes in an enterprise,” he said.
This capability could touch every department, so sales could build a contract or customer on-boarding workflow, marketing could build a document approval process and engineering could coordinate code reviews and product launches, as some examples.
Box Relay was designed in tandem with its best bud, IBM with the understanding it was always going to be a Box tool, says Rand Wacker, Box VP of enterprise. Each player brought its own special strength to the table — IBM its traditional enterprise workflow chops and Box, its new-wave cloud content management — and both companies plan to sell the tool under the Box Relay brand.
Cheryl McKinnon, a Forrester analyst who has been covering content management for years, sees this product as an important test for the Box-IBM alliance. “This launch is a really important proof point for the partnership and joint R&D. This is as important to IBM as it is to Box. Box gets the chance to further entrench itself in content and now process-rich use cases and extend its enterprise street cred, and IBM extends its ability to serve its own enterprise clients  with cloud-native content and process offerings,” McKinnon explained.
Simplicity is in the eye of the beholder of course, but if it works as described, it adds another key piece of the content management puzzle to the Box product line and gives it deeper penetration inside the enterprise customers it craves.
While it’s being announced this week, it won’t be available in wide beta until Q4 with general availability some time next year. It will be billed as an add-on to the basic Box service, giving Box (and IBM) an upsell opportunity.
Look for more coverage from BoxWorks throughout the week.",2016-09-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-493397129.jpg?w=738,"workflow,content-management,ibm",Besties IBM and Box create a workflow tool for regular folks
365,Ingrid Lunden,"One of the biggest tech deals this year — and the biggest ever in the UK — has now closed. Today, Softbank announced that it has completed its acquisition of ARM Holdings, the semiconductor firm that it said in July it would acquire for £24 billion in cash (around $32 billion in today’s currency, $31 billion at the time of the deal), in order to make a big jump into IoT. As a result, ARM will be delisted from the LSE effective September 6. Softbank has said that it plans to run the company as a standalone business.
The news comes a couple of days after the deal received its final required regulatory clearance, paving the way for the close.
“Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition, SBG purchased all of ARM’s issued and to be issued shares (excluding any ARM shares already owned by SBG or an SBG subsidiary) for cash, for a total acquisition price amounting to approximately GBP 24.0 billion (approximately USD 31.0 billion or JPY 3.3 trillion),” the company noted in its announcement. “Subsequent to the completion of the Acquisition, ARM will be delisted from the London Stock Exchange as of September 6, 2016 (GMT) and will cease to be a listed company.”
Softbank will announce the financial and operational impact of the consolidation once it is verified, it said. The companies will start to consolidate their financials as of today.
As we reported at the time the deal was announced, the acquisition of ARM is a big play by Softbank to jump into Internet of Things technology, a sizeable pivot for a company that has made its name more recently around mobile and fixed internet services for consumers, and large investments in outsized- and fast-growing tech companies.
Masayoshi Son, Softbank’s CEO and founder, earlier this year surprised the industry when he announced that he would not retire as he had previously planned, and the acquisition — which he said took took only two weeks to initiate and close — is, in a sense, a mark of how he plans to run things in this next phase of the company’s life.
It’s in contrast to a different spin on the deal, where some believed that Softbank opportunistically swooped in on ARM because of the decline of the pound in the wake of the Brexit vote. That referendum, where the majority of voters in Britain said they wanted the UK to leave the European Union, caused a huge reverberation in the UK economy, and a drop in the value of the British pound.
“Brexit did not affect my decision,” Masayoshi Son said in a press conference the day the deal was announced. “Many people many are worried about Brexit and concerned about he complex situation of the country, but good or bad… I did not make the investment because of Brexit.”
He added that although the price of the pound declined by about 16% in the two weeks that Softbank and ARM negotiated, but ARM’s share price went up by about the same amount, meaning they cancelled each other out. There were other financial factors in play as well: in the weeks leading up to the deal, Softbank sold a chunk of its Alibaba stake and its stake in Supercell, and today it announced a large loan for some $9 billion (¥1 trillion). “This is not opportunistic about the currency,” he joked. “I have wanted to do this but was waiting for the cash to come in.
“I’m not investing in a distressed asset,” he continued. “I’m investing in a paradigm shift…. that’s my passion, and that’s my view.”
If Softbank was in the thick of it at the “beginning of the PC internet,” in Masayoshi’s words (he invested in via Yahoo when it only had 16 employees), and then doubled down on mobile (by way of Softbank’s investments in various mobile companies and acquisition of Sprint) then — he believes — IoT is the natural progression of that.
For ARM, the company has been been one of the UK’s biggest tech success stories. Its growth coincided with the rise of smartphones and its chip reference designs are used by the likes of Apple and many others.
That smartphone business is still there — just last month, longtime chip rival Intel, interestingly, announced it would license ARM’s technology for smartphone chips, in hopes of boosting its own smartphone chipmaking business (in this case to grow business with third-party smartphone chipmakers).
But more importantly, ARM has been shifting its own business to IoT for several years now, in anticipation of a time when growth of its bread-and-butter business might slow down.
(And indeed, that is exactly what’s happening: growth of smartphone sales is now essentially flat as penetration has reached saturation in many markets, and people are waiting longer to replace the phones they already have.)
While there are definitely a lot of products out there now that are “connected” — that is, many ordinary “dumb” objects like refrigerators, locks and lights can now be controlled wirelessly by way of internet connections — the bigger market for IoT products and services is really only just at its start. ARM — and now Softbank — hope that by getting into the game early, they can dominate much as ARM has done in smartphones.",2016-09-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/iotglobe.jpg?w=738,"iot,softbank,arm-holdings",Softbank has completed its £24B cash acquisition of ARM Holdings

Today more than ever, technology is transforming how enterprises do business. The IT profession has evolved from being reactionary to proactive, and CIOs now have a seat at the table to drive company strategy.
Greylock COO Tom Frangione catches up with Kim Stevenson, Intel COO for the Client and Internet of Things Businesses and Systems Architecture Group, to discuss how startups can sell to larger enterprises, the importance of IT innovation and what the future of machine learning means for enterprise companies.
CIOs are becoming the expert source on enterprise trends and new innovative solutions to help companies gain and maintain a competitive advantage. IT topics, like security and data analytics, have become part of the boardroom discussions and key components to a successful business strategy.
Even machine learning and artificial intelligence are entering the enterprise market and being looked at as the next opportunity for innovation. “Whether it’s customer support, identifying security issues or greater levels of automated testing, machine learning has wide-ranging use cases,” says Kim Stevenson.
Companies rely on technological innovation to keep one step ahead of the competition, and startups have proven to be a good way to do that. For startups looking to sell to larger enterprises, it’s important to understand the company’s larger roadmap and business needs. The best startups can “deploy well and scale well” while using customer feedback to pinpoint which features are needed. Startups should add exponential value to their customers, and be prepared to scale alongside the larger enterprise as they grow in size and needs.

367,Anshu Sharma,"

Multitenancy was the single-biggest technology breakthrough in SaaS. Consider this: With more than 100,000 customers, a company like Salesforce would need 100,000-plus servers and databases to serve their needs, essentially wiping out its margins.
Multitenancy not only allowed for higher gross margins, it made it viable to serve small and medium businesses with world-class software  —  at a profit. It was not just a new architecture, but also changed the way we thought of paying for enterprise software —  not by number of CPUs or servers but by users and usage. Similarly, serverless compute is both a new way of building apps and a new way of consuming and paying for it.
Serverless takes the promise of multitenancy to a whole new level. Serverless compute is a computational model where no dedicated server or VM needs to be up and running, as the platform activates and then shuts down the processing, scaling it as needed. You truly pay for only what you need.

In the first decade of SaaS, companies like Salesforce and NetSuite were hardcore proponents of multitenancy, while legacy vendors portrayed it as a compromise, often calling it “risky commingling of customer data.”
The No. 1 leader in enterprise applications software, SAP, invented its own architecture, called mega-tenancy, to compete with multitenancy, while Oracle, the leading database vendor, tried to sell virtualized private databases and other innovations as an alternative. Today, these companies have acquired the likes of Ariba, Concur and NetSuite for tens of billions of dollar and committed to the winning architecture —  multitenancy.
With serverless architecture, we are seeing a whole new range of applications emerging. When it comes to IoT, mobile apps and real-time big data, serverless architecture can be a huge advantage.
Amazon Lambda is seen as a clear leader in this space, while other products like PubNub Blocks and Azure Functions are also building on the same idea. In a few years, every cloud platform will have to support some form of serverless architecture.
Just like the move to multitenancy, you can’t take your existing code and simply make it serverless; you must rethink your applications and rewrite to use these new frameworks.
Multitenancy allowed SMBs to get enterprise-grade applications for CRM (Salesforce), accounting (NetSuite), marketing (Marketo), hiring (SmartRecruiters), etc. at prices they could afford.
With the deluge of data, especially real-time data, it is cost-prohibitive for many use cases to process it and act on it. Serverless computing makes it much more inexpensive by charging you only for the fraction of the time it takes to run your functions.
I look forward to new applications being unleashed by this new architecture and business model over the next 10 years. What Salesforce- and NetSuite-sized companies will this new architecture make possible?

368,Ingrid Lunden,"Salesforce may have missed out on buying LinkedIn, but it has had a whopper of an acquisitions spree so far this year anyway. The enterprise cloud and CRM services company put down over $4 billion to buy eight startups in areas like workplace productivity, machine learning and e-commerce solutions, according to the company’s 10-Q filed with the SEC today.
The majority of that $4 billion went into the acquisition of e-commerce business Demandware (acquired for $2.8 billion in June), and $750 million for cloud-based word processing app Quip, but the filing also revealed some other prices that were not previously reported. Chief among them, Salesforce disclosed that it paid at least $110 million to buy BeyondCore, an enterprise analytics business, last month.
Salesforce also disclosed in the 10-Q that in the first half of the year, in total it paid $58.4 million in cash, net of cash acquired, for three other companies. These could include data center analytics startup Coolan, data-entry automation company Implisit Insights and PredictionIO, three companies whose individual acquisition prices were not disclosed at the time their deals were announced this year; but it could also include Your SL, a digital consultancy based in Berlin, which was quietly acquired in February to build out Salesforce Deutschland’s own sales and enterprise integration business.
The pace of Salesforce’s acquisitions, and the total value paid, are significant for a couple of reasons.
It underscores the consolidation trend that we are seeing in the market today, where the large proliferation of startups that have emerged over the last several years is now thinning out; and some of the most promising, rather than growing on their own (either because funding is getting harder to come by, or because they can see more opportunity in combining with bigger entities), are getting snapped up by bigger fish.
The bigger fish, meanwhile, are picking up key technologies, products and talent (and in some cases, customers) to scale without having to build from the ground up, which gets harder to do in many cases as the tech world continues to mature.
A further undisclosed sum will be paid for BeyondCore in an earn-out “based on continued employment of certain recipients following closing of the acquisition.” It’s not clear how much that second tranche of money may be but it could be sizeable. For some context, Salesforce only disclosed paying $410 million for Quip in its Q-10, although we have had multiple sources confirm to us that the price including earn-outs was $340 million more than that.
BeyondCore’s tech, after the acquisition closes (expected end of October, Salesforce says), will be folded into Wave, Salesforce’s analytics product, which just today was updated with features targeting specific verticals. The company as a startup had disclosed only $9 million in funding, from Menlo Ventures, whose partner John Jarve invested in the company, coincidentally today noted that the deal with Salesforce had closed.
The list of acquisitions for the first half of this year was rounded out with MetaMind, which was acquired for $32.8 million (a figure that Salesforce disclosed in Q1) to expand Salesforce’s capabilities in natural language processing; and “quote to cash” startup SteelBrick for $360 million, to add in a tool for salespeople to offer quick quotes to customers.
Salesforce said the three deals totalling $58.4 million are still being worked through to some extent via earn outs and other processes; and Salesforce said it expects to finalise the valuations “as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition dates.”",2016-09-01,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/clouds.jpg?w=738,"demandware,quip,beyondcore","Salesforce paid $110M for BeyondCore, made $4B+ in acquisitions in 6 months"
369,Ron Miller,"When Salesforce introduced its Wave analytics product back in October, 2014, it was mostly framed as a tool for managers to get a grip on the sales pipeline in a visual way. In a series of announcements today, Salesforce made it clear that it’s taking Wave vertical with a variety of job-specific Wave applications.
Since its launch, much like Salesforce CRM itself, Wave has grown from an application made up of a set of functions into a platform on top of which Salesforce and third-parties can build custom applications. Today’s announcement includes new task-driven tools from Salesforce and independent software vendor (ISVs) partners, along with new design tools to give internal IT departments the ability to customize their own dashboards.
For starters, Salesforce announced new Wave applications for financial services and B2B marketing. The former is designed to help financial advisors identify their highest value clients and more easily see which clients’ portfolios are affected by a market shift or change in conditions. The B2B dashboard is supposed to help marketers and salespeople see which campaigns and approaches are working and which ones aren’t with the goal of finding ways for these two groups to work more cooperatively and smarter than they typically have in the past.
Meanwhile, the ISVs have also gotten into the action with 19 third-party apps, which will be available in the AppExchange starting today. Much like the other parts of today’s announcements, these apps are designed to pull together the data underpinnings for a particular job.
As an example, Salesforce partner, ThinkLP, a company focused on retail loss prevention, has developed a Wave application to bring together a variety of loss data into a single dashboard view to help loss prevention specialists find issues that would presumably be much more difficult to identify with the data spread across a number of data sources.
Finally, Salesforce is introducing a couple of tools for the IT department to build their own custom internal dashboards. While they try to make it sound easy as dragging and dropping, connecting it to external data sources takes some skill and understanding of the individual API connectors — and I suspect this is a fair bit of work.

370,Matthew Lynley,"Salesforce earnings came out today! They’re not great, either, and it looks like a weak outlook for the company’s third quarter is doing some damage to its shares, which were down as much as 8 percent.
For a company that literally defined the phrase “software as a service” — basically, running your business online — and one that’s had a decent year (shares are about flat), today’s numbers apparently don’t look very good for Wall Street. Salesforce has been aggressively spending on acquisitions, buying Demandware for $2.8 billion and Quip for $750 million earlier this year. Whether this will keep shareholders happy is predicated on that strategy being a healthy one to add to Salesforce’s growth, and while these acquisitions only recently happened, it looks like Wall Street may be having some doubts about Salesforce’s future.
Here’s the quick scorecard:
That share drop might not seem like a large number, but for a company worth tens of billions of dollars, a 5 percent slide can easily mean erasing more than $2 billion in value from the company. If it’s going to continue making aggressive acquisitions, it has to keep that share price healthy in order to make the pitch that the companies are getting their money’s worth when they make their sales. For any company that’s recently been bought by Salesforce — and there have been a lot — with shares as part of the deal, employees are watching their value drop in real time.
It looks like that last part about missing slightly on guidance was not a happy data point with investors. This is still the first time the company has brought in $2 billion in revenue in a single quarter, but it’s not enough to keep its run going after aggressively spending on new businesses and talent. Shares of Salesforce are up more than 30 percent in the past two years, but for 2017 they’ve been mostly flat.
And, there’s also this:

Salesforce’s core business is increasingly finding itself in competition with other companies that are choosing to specialize in one area of its core business (like Zendesk in its customer service tools), where those companies try to aggressively outperform Salesforce’s all-in-one tools. So it has to invent new ways to continue driving its revenue growth in order to keep investors happy, and that means inventing new businesses or — in the past year in Salesforce’s case — spending billions of dollars on potential new businesses.
Update: The share price is continuing to fall, now down more than 8 percent in extended trading.",2016-08-31,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/salesforce.jpg?w=738,"quip,demandware",Salesforce shares face plant despite beating analyst expectations
371,Lora Kolodny,"Redwood City-based Glint has raised $27 million in a Series C round of venture funding for software that helps companies figure out how their teams are experiencing problems, or why and when solid employees may leave, undesirably.
Glint replaces the traditional 360-review tools used by corporate HR teams and executives with short, anonymous surveys sent out once in a while to specific groups or company-wide to gather feedback.
Then, Glint’s software-as-a-service uses machine learning, natural language processing and predictive analytics to identify key areas for improvement.
Understanding what employees want more or less of, and how employees are feeling about management, perks or benefits, their industry and more helps businesses avoid internal problems and attrition.
Meritech Capital Partners and Bessemer Venture Partners co-led the round joined by returning investors Norwest Venture Partners, and Shasta Ventures, and bringing Glint’s total equity funding raised to $50 million.
Glint CEO and co-founder Jim Barnett explained that Glint protects confidentiality, in part, by only allowing employers to slice and dice data down to a group of 5 or more people, and only giving certain people permission to read employees’ comments.
“Only the right people see the right survey data, and employees can choose to fill those out or not. We do get get average response rates of 85% though,” he said.
Companies can customize surveys to be longer or shorter, more or less frequently issued.
Clients of Glint include Verizon-owned AOL (the parent company of TechCrunch), E-bay, Cognizant and Sky Broadcasting, among others.
Medium to large enterprises are drawn to Glint’s software and analytics platform, the CEO said, because it helps them avoid attrition and performance issues, and allows them to take all employees’ comments into consideration efficiently, unlike a traditional process that involved manual reviews and reading of suggestions or complaints.
The platform supports companies in 30 different languages, so far.
Glint also helps companies understand how employees’ satisfaction with their work and their employers may be effecting their business. For example, a health care company may find that patient outcomes are highly correlated with happy employees, or employees who feel happy with the flexibility of their schedules, he said.
Bessemer Ventures’ Kristina Shen said she believes Glint has the potential to get to an initial public offering, eventually. But the HR-tech market is one of many mergers and acquisitions, historically.
She believes that Glint’s technology is tapping into major trends reshaping the workplace, namely that millennial workers want to be heard, and that employers have woken up to the fact that losing good employees is very costly.
Shen said, “For every employee you lose, you spend a lot of money on recruiting, hiring and onboarding . It just feels better and costs you less to figure out what employees really want, then bring it to them, versus losing a good employee.”
Glint intends to use its funding for hiring, product development and to move into new market segments, after early customer traction in Silicon Valley and with tech companies.",2016-08-31,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/screen-shot-2016-08-31-at-2-44-04-pm.png?w=674,"360-review,employee-engagement,hr-tech,glint",Glint raises $27 million to stop solid employees from bailing
372,John Mannes,"Today, Facebook is releasing its Zstandard compression algorithm into the wild as open source. The lossless compression technology is aimed at replacing existing libraries like zlib that are powered by the outdated Deflate compression algorithm. In addition to Zstandard, Facebook is also dropping its MyRocks storage engine as open source. MyRocks is currently being used by Facebook to improve the storage efficiency of its MySQL databases.
Both releases occurred in coordination with Facebook’s @Scale conference in San Jose. The conference supports engineers working to solve large-scale engineering challenges by bringing them together, side-by-side, with other companies in the industry dedicated to increasing the prevalence of open-source technology. Both Zstandard and MyRocks will enable developers to build platforms that can efficiently scale to large and diverse user bases.
One of the greatest fears of engineers looking to update and replace critical infrastructure is that the new libraries could bring an entire service down. Jay Parikh, vice president of infrastructure engineering at Facebook, is proud of the fact that both Zstandard and MyRocks were tested at scale across the company before being released to the community.
“Everyone here uses all of the products,” added Parikh.
In the six months that Facebook has been testing Zstandard, the company noted impressive results. With the same compression ratio of zlib, Zstandard was five times faster. In a case where the compression time was held constant, files were 10 percent smaller.
MyRocks has also produced some serious storage efficiencies. When compared to compressed InnoDB, MyRocks was able to store the same amount of data on half the server space.
“Making it open source makes the community better,” added Parikh. “It will be adopted more quickly as open source than had if was created as the proprietary technology of a single company.”
Facebook hopes that their open source solutions can become new industry standards.",2016-08-31,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-532955831.jpg?w=738,"data-storage,data-compression,mysql",Facebook open sources Zstandard compression algorithm and MyRocks storage engine
373,Ron Miller,"Okta announced it was bringing identity management to APIs today at its Oktane customer conference in Las Vegas.
For a long time, Okta was about connecting people with cloud applications such as ServiceNow, Salesforce or Office 365. A couple of years ago, the company extended that capability to enable customers to control the devices where employees could access those cloud applications.
Today’s announcement is an acknowledgement that the programs themselves are made up of multiple services within an app, such as combining Google Maps for location with Twilio for communication and Braintree for payments. While it feels like a single program, it’s actually crossing multiple gateways to deliver the experience.
“This really lets our customers extend control to APIs,” Okta CEO Todd McKinnon told TechCrunch.
This could work in a couple of ways, he said. APIs often require administrative or programmer-level access and Okta can help companies manage this access by policy. It also gives them an audit trail of anyone who has tried to access the API gateway.
“Hackers are good at finding the weakest link, and maybe they could find the system doesn’t have the API locked down. Having a system to guarantee there is a strong access policy, in a lot of cases can tighten the weakest link,” McKinnon said.
Okta’s API system uses OAuth 2.0 access control in conjunction with Okta’s policy engine and administrative access control panel. It has also partnered with API access management vendors like Apigee and MuleSoft.
Okta is a company at a crossroads. It was just last September that it announced a healthy $75 million round on a $1.2 billion valuation, propelling it into the heady unicorn club. The company has raised a hefty $230 million since inception in 2009, and at last year’s funding announcement suggested an IPO could be coming in the next 12-18 months.
A year later, the tech IPO market has been slow, and McKinnon is being cagier about going public, saying he can’t comment on a possible date.
“I will say that if anyone gives you a date, it probably means they are not going public. In general, over the last few years, as we have gotten closer to being a public company, we have looked at what companies are doing well and are being fairly valued [in the public markets].”
He says that the biggest change he’s seen is that the market doesn’t value growth as it once did and companies burning cash are being punished. “In that context, we are going to make the best decisions about how fast we are growing, how much cash we are burning and so forth,” he said.
It’s hard to know what that all means, but they are still within that 12-18 month window McKinnon referenced last year.",2016-08-30,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-168351288.jpg?w=738,"apis,identity-management,todd-mckinnon,okta",Okta extends identity management to APIs
374,Ron Miller,"VMware announced a series of updates to its virtual desktop (VDI) line today at VMworld in Las Vegas.
The announcement attempts to set the virtual desktop in a more modern context, by offering customers a range of options in the cloud, on-prem or hybrid. What’s more, it’s trying to reduce the cost by partnering with a variety of hardware vendors from HP to Dell and even the ultra low-cost Raspberry Pi. It also announced a partnership with IBM to run the cloud version of the virtual desktops on IBM’s infrastructure service, Softlayer.
The company claims it has solved deployment speed issues with this update by providing more efficient pooling of the resources feeding the virtual desktops. This should lead to faster deployment and a more persistent desktop feel, even during peak access times, such as first thing in the morning.
VMware also has tuned the system to work well on a tablet, allowing employees to access all of their work in a virtual shell on an iPad or similar device.
Virtual desktops have always offered the promise of easier management along with tighter security, but the market has never really lived up to the early hype. The idea was that instead of giving everyone a loaded PC, you would give them a much cheaper dumb terminal and feed them the tools they need to do their job each morning.
It was tantamount to bringing back the mainframe with dumb terminals, but instead of a costly mainframe, you had a pool of resources available from an off-the-shelf PC network, which presumably would be much cheaper and easier to operate.
Unfortunately, when everyone turns on their computer at 8:30 am, it puts undue pressure on the networks and the resource pool. While the cloud offers the same type of upside as the virtual desktop including the ability to use much lighter-weight PCs, the argument goes that you have tighter control with VDIs and they’re more secure (at least in theory). That’s because the desktop gets blown away every night at the end of the shift and your employees aren’t on the open internet.
According to some figures, the virtual desktop market size has topped out at around 8 percent of enterprise PC deployments, far below the 30 percent some were predicting five years ago. That makes it a niche solution for finance, education and some other settings that want firm control over their computing environment.
VMware and Citrix were two of the earliest to market. Other vendors include Microsoft, HP, Dell, Red Hat and other traditional enterprise players. AWS also offers a native cloud version, Amazon WorkSpaces, and recently announced billing by the hour.",2016-08-30,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-10167973.jpg?w=738,"virtual-machines,virtual-desktops,vmware",VMware update strives to place virtual desktops in modern context
375,Matthew Lynley,"David Drummond, who joined Uber’s board of directors in August 2013, stepped down several weeks ago, Uber has confirmed to TechCrunch. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.
At first blush: no surprise whatsoever. Earlier this month, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said the company’s first fleet of self-driving cars would begin running in Pittsburgh soon (as soon as this month, even!). The fleet consists of about a hundred modified Volvo XC90s, co-piloted by one engineer who can take the wheel when necessary. In other words: a straightforward competitor for Alphabet’s self-driving car.
For the past year-plus, both Alphabet and Uber have been working on their own variations of self-driving cars. Alphabet’s efforts have been considerably more public, but throughout both development processes Drummond has remained on Uber’s board. Now it seems that the reality that the two companies are increasingly becoming direct competitors is setting in, and a change of plans is in order.
The Information earlier today reported that, Drummond was left out of meetings at Uber. That’s not surprising — Alphabet’s efforts to build a self-driving car could be kneecapped by Uber’s rollout of its own self-driving car fleet. In an Uber-centric future, car usage is largely an on-demand model, and a constantly cruising fleet of self-driving cars powered by Uber’s technology removes a big potential opportunity for Alphabet.
Alphabet for years has been working on this kind of technology, though it’s been focused on a much more radical, steering wheel-less cruiser. With Google specializing in software and machine learning, it seemed like the company was well on its way to becoming a standard for self-driving vehicles, but increasingly Alphabet is finding itself dealing with competition.

While there have been plenty of setbacks, Tesla has aggressively pushed for this kind of a future in its vehicles, and it seems increasingly on its way to becoming the norm. This kind of experience also isn’t even new for Alphabet. In 2009, Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt stepped down from Apple’s board as the two companies began ruthlessly fighting out over whether Google (at the time) stole ideas from the iPhone and began to increasingly eat away at the early smartphone-maker’s lead.
It seems that GV’s David Krane (who took the reigns of the firm from Bill Maris earlier this month) is still a board observer, though The Information also reports that Krane is getting the cold shoulder. Again, while GV is an independent investment arm, it’s obviously linked to Alphabet proper and it would be strategically unsound to keep that information flowing freely if the two end up direct competitors.
Uber confirmed the departure to us in a statement from Drummond:

376,Jon Lee,"

A new player has entered the enterprise productivity race. For decades, Microsoft reigned as the market leader in enterprise productivity — until Google pushed into the space with Google Apps. Now, with the acquisition of Quip, Salesforce is joining Microsoft and Google in the race.
The implications, however, extend far beyond productivity and CRM. Recent developments in enterprise software — including Oracle’s acquisition of NetSuite, Microsoft’s purchase of LinkedIn and Salesforce’s acquisition of Demandware and Quip — point to a shift in the market.
Enterprise software (not just productivity apps) can no longer be siloed applications bolted together with varying degrees of integration. Today’s tools are expected to be cross-functional, with native integration, real-time collaboration and smart communication at their very core.
Enterprise software giants across different verticals are moving in the direction of end-to-end solutions in an attempt to own more of the workflow — Salesforce’s acquisition of Quip will only intensify the competition. For enterprise software startups, it’s indicative of more mergers and acquisitions to come.
Enterprise software spending is on an upward trend, and is expected to reach $326 billion this year; meanwhile, startups and investors have taken notice. There are currently 1,425 active startups in the space — as listed by CrunchBase — and there’s been an influx of venture funding. According to PitchBook, venture funding of enterprise productivity startups has more than doubled, from $4.75 billion in 2012 to $11.46 billion last year. This year, these software startups have already raised $6.26 billion to date, and the median deal size is up 25 percent compared to 2015, reflecting current market demand and investor appetite.
With investors hot on enterprise startups, the market will become more fragmented and saturated than ever before. End users are already inundated with dozens, if not hundreds, of similar software solutions, each which focus on filling one specific business need as effectively and efficiently as possible.
In an environment where the biggest technology leaders are looking to startups for new innovation and transformation, there will likely be a coming spike in M&A activity. A historical analysis of CrunchBase data reveals an ongoing trend: enterprise software startups are seven times more likely to get acquired than they are to shut down, while only 4 percent make it to an IPO.
Productivity is a loosely defined category, but it starts with word processors, spreadsheet applications, presentation software and others (think Microsoft Office or Google Apps for Work). Aside from Quip, there are still quite a few notable startups disrupting this space.
Standalone solutions like Prezi, the interactive presentation startup that’s raised $73 million and attracted 75 million customers, and Paper, Dropbox’s answer to Google Docs, are pushing the boundaries of how productivity apps should function.
Others like Blockspring aren’t reinventing the wheel, but instead are innovating on existing products. The young startup, which raised $3.4 million in seed funding, connects spreadsheets like Excel and Google Sheets to make it easier to import data from third-party services like MailChimp, Slack and LinkedIn.
Any of these types of startups could make for a strategic acquisition by larger software companies that are either looking to strengthen existing products or expand their offering into other verticals.
Email clients and collaborative communication platforms are at the epicenter of modern workflows. For a software giant like Salesforce, whose core product (CRM) relies so heavily on email communications, startups in this segment are particularly attractive targets for an acquisition.
Front offers a collaborative email platform that reinvents (or at least improves) email by adding a social layer with the “shared inbox.” Founded in 2013, Front has raised more than $13 million from investors, one of whom is Slack’s co-founder, Stewart Butterfield.
Speaking of Slack, many messaging-based platforms are attempting to displace email as the main form of communication. Redbooth, a startup that’s raised $19 million, and seed-stage startups Azendoo and Fleep are also following in Slack’s footsteps with team messaging platforms that aim to enhance productivity and collaboration.
There are many other verticals within enterprise software — from project management and marketing automation to business analytics — but CRM is especially interesting, given two factors: (1) Salesforce’s involvement in the enterprise race and (2) CRM’s role in driving revenue and business growth, making it one of the most valuable software categories in enterprise software.
That said, CRM startups are plentiful and only a few are interesting enough to stand out. Heymarket, a startup founded this year, offers a CRM to help businesses manage text message communications, which could make for an interesting addition to an existing CRM suite’s arsenal.

Sure, there are solutions like OnlyOffice, Zoho Docs and Polaris Office, but these can hardly be considered startups. That last part is important because startups, with their fresh outlook and high risk tolerance, are the true drivers of innovation.
Whether the lack of startups in this segment is because entrepreneurs and/or investors perceive the barrier to entry to be too high, or they see limited opportunity, Quip’s acquisition is sure to spark new interest. Meanwhile, enterprise giants will continue snapping up these enterprise software upstarts to bolster and innovate higher-performance offerings in an attempt to provide customers with a seamless, uninterrupted workflow.",2016-08-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-483774045.jpg?w=738,"enterprise-software,mergers-and-acquisitions,quip",What Salesforce’s acquisition of Quip means for enterprise software startups
377,David Chao,"

Bluetooth beacons are proven technology. So why isn’t anyone using them effectively?
Sure, companies are using them. Google uses “beacons” — you’ll find a slew of examples of their use in retail and other B2C contexts. Apple kicked it off in 2013 with iBeacons in their stores. McDonald’s followed suit in 2014, pushing to customers special deals on sandwiches and McNuggets. By 2015, companies like Macy’s, Target, Walgreens and Best Buy were all using beacons to track users and boost sales.
But are we seeing a return on that investment?
Recently, the beacon buzz has been rather quiet. Even with adoption by big brand names, the promise that beacons would “revolutionize retail” seems to have been premature. How many of you have apps on your phone with beacon-powered push messages enabled? I’m guessing not many.
It turns out that as a culture, we’re tired of being marketed to. We’re sick of ads, and we’re creeped out by businesses stalking our movements. For many of us, 10 percent off toilet paper on our monthly Target run isn’t worth the hassle of downloading an app, then managing a barrage of notifications that we find mostly irrelevant. Beacons, or an evolved version of them, will likely infiltrate our retail experiences eventually. But we’re not there yet.
That doesn’t mean, however, that beacons aren’t useful. The real innovation around beacons is happening not at your local mega-mart, but in the enterprise. Retail showed us that beacon technology works. In the enterprise, we’ll see how it can add real value.
I believe that beacons will be one of the vanguards of the “smart office.” Like devices such as Nest streamlined our home environments, beacons will help us work more efficiently, productively and collaboratively. Here are some examples of what that will look like.
Just like Bluetooth lets you unlock your car without a key, beacons can streamline employee access to everything from physical spaces to electronic records. Using beacons could eliminate extras like key cards and make proprietary systems and fobs unnecessary, saving the company and its employees time and money.
What if you always knew where every piece of equipment was located without annoying codes to determine inventory? Beacons can be used to track valuable property for improved asset management.
With beacons, employees will spend less time tracking down the stuff they need to do their jobs. This application could be convenient for things like computers, but life-saving in places like hospitals. It also enables companies to learn how assets are being used in order to plan more effectively, optimizing equipment purchasing, rental, utilization and attrition.

In short, it empowers casual interactions to get work done. Non-office work environments see tremendous opportunity, as well. Tracking people’s locations on construction sites, in warehouses or in factories could bring benefits even more critical than productivity, like keeping people safe and compliant. And in an emergency, knowing where people are could literally make the difference between life and death.
Another use case specifically relevant to large corporate campuses, beacons can help people understand where they are, and where they need to go. By pushing information, including your location, a map or specific directions to a conference room (plus the Wi-Fi password once you get there), beacons can empower more time spent working, and less time spent wandering.
Beacons can help our offices become more efficient and secure, protecting and enabling our people and assets without an army of manual resources:
These examples are just the tip of the iceberg. Beacons and their ecosystems have incredible potential to transform how we do work, from the conference room to the construction site. Best of all, they’re cheap and adaptable. For 10 bucks a beacon, you can increase productivity, security, collaboration, comfort, efficiency, safety and more.
I’d call that a smart investment in the soon-to-be-smarter office.",2016-08-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-577095744.jpg?w=738,,5 ways beacons are transforming the enterprise

Information technology shifted 15 years ago from perpetually licensed, on-premise software to Software as a Service (SaaS).
The shift created significant opportunities for startups, but led to the death of companies that ignored the change. These companies were stunned to find that traction was not enough to interest investors and, at best, they sold at low valuations to legacy technology companies.
Today, information technology is shifting from the SaaS workflow applications that characterized the cloud computing era to those that help customers make decisions. Characterized as the intelligence era, the source of competitive advantage is shifting from code to unique data + self-learning code. As with the previous shift, this brings a change in the expectations of investors. We are seeing investors outright ignore SaaS companies with solid traction in favor of companies that have a strategic position in the market granted by their “intelligent” software.
This post generalizes the requirements of enterprise software investors in the intelligence era in the hope that it helps founders of enterprise software companies think about how to sequence their fundraising, product development and data strategy.
The company characteristics below are what investors generally expect at the point of raising that round. For example, Series A investors generally expect to see annual contracts with examples of where you’ve expanded revenue with specific customers before investing. Seed investors focused on intelligent enterprise software generally expect to see that you’re collecting unique data before investing.

We’re seeing that the bottom half of this table (shaded in tan) is increasingly important. Companies need to show they’re building a competitive advantage through unique data + self-learning code to raise a Series A from a world-class investor. SaaS without data is not enough. This means that companies need to pick seed investors that are savvy to the impending shift to the intelligence era, help them with this strategy and have the track record of attracting world-class Series A investors. The best seed investors play the role of a “Data Product Manager” until the full team comes together.
Let’s define the characteristics on the left and explain the rightward progression, separating table stakes from what’s truly necessary today.
The top half of this table includes the characteristics required to raise money from a world-class investor when the cloud was a new thing, and SaaS was the future. Was. Today, deploying to the cloud is a given and you need more to break away from the competition. But first, let’s talk about the basics.

Go to market: How you reach potential customers. “Bottom up” means that you don’t spend money on sales and marketing, instead relying on word-of-mouth through social channels and free PR to build an initial base of customers. Companies now tend to graduate from here by hiring customer success and inside sales reps to mine that initial base of customers for those with big budgets. Outside sales reps are hired after exhausting this bottom-up strategy.
Typical Customer: The profile of a typical purchaser. This determines their level of sophistication, revenue potential and sales cycles. Some startups may start by selling to large companies. Small to medium businesses (SMB) are less sophisticated and have lower revenue potential but are easier to reach, have shorter sales cycles and are less likely to be using a high-quality alternative. Interestingly, a startup can gather a large volume of data across SMBs such that it can build machine learning models that compete with those built by larger companies.
Contract Basis: The basis on which revenue recurs. Companies get the leverage to negotiate for longer terms as they build stickiness with customers by providing better products.
Average ACV: Average Annual Contract Value. Larger average ACV means that you’re successfully selling to larger customers, into more divisions and/or at higher prices. Some companies may keep ACV constant but significantly increase volume.
Annualized Revenue: There are many useful measures of revenue, but this is a universal number that you can calculate by annualizing last month’s revenue. This is not the same as annual recurring revenue (ARR). Churn is important here, but it’s hard to define a milestone. Seed investors will not have enough data to draw conclusions about churn. Series A investors, depending on the sales model, will dig into 12+ months of data to understand churn — and usually need to see negative churn.
Rightward progression with respect to these characteristics, as represented by the tan shading in the table, means you’re building a competitive advantage through unique data + self-learning code — crucial to raising a Series A from a world-class investor.

General Team: Those on your team who aren’t software engineers. This is probably just founders and a designer at the seed stage, adding sales/marketing (a strategic marketer, inside sales and customer success) by the Series A stage and rounding out the executive team (with BD, finance, operations and HR) by the Series B stage.
Engineering Team: The people making the software. Start with those who can efficiently get the product into your customers’ hands. Then, as you collect data, you can use data science talent to deliver insights to your customers in the form of predictive features. This is where hiring gets hard; you’ll need your investors to give you every advantage you can get. As you scale, you’ll need some infrastructure specialists and great engineering managers.
Data Strategy: A crucial part of your plan to build an intelligent software product. A clean, unique data set is a competitive advantage in itself (so don’t sell it!). From there, you can start building predictive models with your customers’ data and turning successful experiments into features that help them make decisions. Finally, you will have a product that uses incremental data to improve models; making the product better, attracting more customers, getting more data and so on — a “‘Virtuous Loop.”
This compounding competitive advantage is something that only Google and a few others have built, but is within reach of today’s startups. As you can see, one has to be purposeful about this strategy from Day One. Great investors will focus on helping you create a coordinated data and business process strategy. They will guide data set, model and feature development to build a Virtuous Loop. Investors focused on similar companies will help you assess whether you’re collecting unique data compared to your competition.
Positioning: How are you different from everyone else in the market? Where you are on a Gartner map determines how many big enterprise customers take notice of your company  —  like it or not. Seed-stage companies usually have a workflow product that is better/cheaper/nicer than existing products, collecting data in the background. The addition of predictive features helps customers make decisions, making your product key to their strategy and giving you lock-in. A full-featured product will quickly expand to all lines of business within your customers’ companies such that it’s a “must-have.”
Partnerships: Partnerships are a distraction before the seed stage. However, companies can leverage a few key marketing partnerships with complementary product companies to get enough traction to raise a Series A. Further, companies can form partnerships to get access to large data sets, bootstrapping their machine learning efforts. Hiring full-time business development talent after your Series A will help you form an ecosystem of sales, marketing and product partnerships ahead of a Series B.
InsideSales
InsideSales.com is a sales acceleration platform that automatically recommends prospects. InsideSales started as a SaaS company but is now a quintessential intelligent software company, using data to build a self-learning engine that drives up to 30 percent revenue growth for their customers after just 90 days. Here’s how they made this rightward progression.
Typical Customer: InsideSales started by signing up SMBs, gathering a large volume of data across those customers with which to build machine learning models. Roughly 100,000 sales reps at more than 3,000 companies, including ADP, GE and Salesforce, use their software today.
Engineering Team: InsideSales started with a team of generalist engineers and now have 30 machine learning engineers with PhDs working with well over 100 billion records of data, adding 5 billion per month  —  the largest sales database in the world.
Data Strategy: InsideSales started by collecting data on phone calls and emails, then built some predictive features to tell you when to call/email someone to maximize the chance of closing a deal. The software anonymizes and normalizes data from one customer, learns over that data, synthesizes the learning into a prediction and delivers that to another customer. They’ve closed the Virtuous Loop.
Positioning: The initial product was a Call Dialer that helped an inside sales rep crank through a prospect list. The addition of automatic recommendations saw InsideSales reposition as a sales acceleration platform and increase its average selling price per seat to be 2-3x that of complementary system of record vendors in the ecosystem.
Partnerships: InsideSales has a marketing partnership with the leading CRM platforms — Microsoft Dynamics and Salesforce —  and strategic investment from both parent companies. The recent launch of the Neuralytics platform allows any company to feed their data into InsideSales’ core machine learning technology, opening up opportunities for InsideSales outside of the sales use case.
Affirm
Affirm uses data to give companies the confidence to offer monthly payment terms to their customers.
Data Strategy: Affirm initially provided merchants with a way to offer financing to customers based on public data. Now, it uses a combination of public data and individual lender data to manage repayment and buyer fraud risk. Additionally, Affirm uses that data to optimize the checkout flow for merchants, increasing average basket size.
Positioning: Affirm evolved its positioning from a widget on e-commerce websites to a company re-building core parts of financial infrastructure and an independent banking brand for millennials.
Partnerships: Affirm built a strong set of partnerships as it grew. First, with Shopify to offer financing on any Shopify store. Then, with First Data to offer financing to customers in brick-and-mortar stores through the Clover Point of Sale system. These partnerships could also provide Affirm with new customer data that it can feed into its credit scores.
Euclid Analytics
Retail, quick-service restaurants and shopping malls use Euclid’s products to understand customer behavior in their physical locations to optimize marketing and operations.
Data Strategy: Euclid invented a novel way to identify and triangulate shopper behavior through Wi-Fi signals and mobile phones. It uses the combination of hundreds of millions of shopper events and external data sources to provide recommendations to its retail, restaurant and mall customers. For example, which marketing campaigns, staffing changes and menu updates increase restaurant visits?

Positioning: Euclid evolved from “Google Analytics for the real world” to “insights and personalization for the physical world.” That is, the company went from offering dashboards to offering insights by adding complementary data sources and enabling online-to-offline attribution and engagement in physical locations.
Partnerships: Euclid partners with Wi-Fi OEMs, VARs and MSPs to integrate with major hardware providers. Further, the Euclid ecosystem analyzes location data alongside a range of additional data sources, including Door Counters, POS, CRM, MAP and staffing systems.
EventBoard
EventBoard started out as those iPads you see in meeting rooms and is now the leader in optimizing the workplace and workforce. Here’s how they made this rightward progression.
Data Strategy: The company signed up 300 SMBs before raising a seed round, and has since onboarded more than 1,800 customers, including Viacom, National Instruments and GE. The product now generates more than 150 million unique data points per month, combines that with data from integrated products and offers analytics on the workplace and workforce, e.g. room utilization, causes of meeting cancellations, re-booking rates, frequently skipped meetings and the cost of meetings.
Positioning: EventBoard evolved from conference room scheduling to digital workplace and workforce optimization. The product seamlessly brings together people, places and technology to create a better and more efficient workplace, and a more effective workforce.
Partnerships: Apple recommended EventBoard to many large companies because it changed the value proposition of iPads in the enterprise. Today, EventBoard has strong strategic investors and solid partnerships with Apple, Google, Aruba/HP and GE. GE provides access to rich data sets that the company leverages to provide even deeper insights and analytics. EventBoard also started to build a channel strategy.
Over the next decade, cloud-based software will require intelligent features to effectively help customers increase revenue, lower cost or be in compliance. This will be true for both existing lines of business in the enterprise and new markets such as the industrial internet, precision agriculture, smart cities and bioinformatics.
The key question for an entrepreneur is the same as always: How will my investors add value? Today that means: How will my investors help me build a next-generation team, form a data strategy, position my company, make partnerships and keep me funded with the best syndicate for the marathon ahead?

379,Frederic Lardinois,"Rackspace, which is still best known as a hosting company even as it has expanded aggressively into offering services for businesses that use other platforms, went public in 2008. Now, however, it’s going private again after accepting a $4.3 billion offer (or $32 per share) in cash from private equity firm Apollo Global Management. The deal is still subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the last quarter of this year.
Over the last few years, it became increasingly clear that Rackspace wasn’t going to be able to compete with the likes of AWS, Google and Microsoft in the cloud space, despite getting an early start in this business. The company then turned toward offering managed hosting services with a strong focus on helping enterprises manage both their private clouds and cloud deployments on the likes of AWS and Azure. Rackspace, together with NASA, also founded the open source OpenStack project, which provides enterprises with the building blocks for setting up their own private clouds (which it will also happily manage for its customers). Rackspace itself is one of the largest OpenStack users in its public cloud, too.
This move toward becoming more of a services company has worked reasonably well and Rackspace’s quarterly results have pointed upwards for the last few years. That slow but steady growth, however, wasn’t rewarded by Wall Street, with the company’s stock recently trading as low as $16.76, down from almost $80 back in 2013 and a high of close to $55 in early 2015. That made the company an obvious candidate for going private again with the help of a private equity company like Apollo.
“We are presented with a significant opportunity today as mainstream companies move their computing out of corporate data centers and into multi-cloud models,” said Taylor Rhodes, president and CEO of Rackspace, in a canned statement today. “Apollo and its partners take a patient, value-oriented approach to their funds’ investments, and value Rackspace’s strategy and unique culture. This is an exciting transaction for Rackspace and we look forward to working closely together.”
It remains to be seen how Apollo will manage Rackspace and how patient it will be, but there may be an upside for the company here as it will be able to grow and continue its transformation at its own pace.",2016-08-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/rackspace-earnings.png?w=738,"apollo,web-hosting,private-equity,rackspace",Rackspace to go private after $4.3B acquisition by private equity firm Apollo
380,Matthew Lynley,"Dropbox is requiring users who have not changed their passwords since mid-2012 to reset their passwords this afternoon.
The action appears to be related to continued fallout over the massive hack on LinkedIn in 2012 where credentials for 117 million accounts were posted online. In recent months, treasure troves of user credentials and passwords — in addition to a large MySpace hack disclosed in May — have been discovered. Even though the data for these accounts is old, often passwords remain unchanged for long periods of time and are re-used across multiple accounts, leaving entire online identities vulnerable to hacks.
Dropbox’s intelligence team identified the existence of a file that contained hashed and salted passwords, according to a person familiar with the matter. That file pertains to passwords that were likely obtained in connection to the LinkedIn hack. While the information appears to have been taken from then and quietly held for some time, it is now surfacing, this person said. Dropbox earlier disclosed that usernames and passwords that were obtained in 2012 were used to access some accounts.

It’s not surprising that Dropbox would react this way to account credentials surfacing. While a broad password reset can carry some negative optics, requiring a password reset is generally the best practice to ensure that it can lock down its data and keep the service from getting further compromised. If user hacks start creeping out and spread across more and more of its user base, it can undermine the security — and perception thereof — of a company. For a company holding onto your files, especially if they are sensitive or important, that perception can almost be as important as the security itself.
It’s generally good practice to not leave these old passwords sitting around. Dropbox’s efforts — while proactive — underscore the necessity of strong password usage. Just because passwords are on old services that fade into history (see: MySpace) doesn’t mean that they can’t come back and have repercussions today if they are always the same.
This is also just a good general moment in time to remind people to please set up two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication may be a bit of a pain in the log-in process, but it’s one of the best ways to better secure an account. Two of the best-possible strategies to avoid security breaches across multiple accounts is to have two-factor authentication set up as well as using different passwords for different accounts to make sure there is no cross-pollination that leaves multiple account susceptible.",2016-08-25,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dropbox-biz1.jpg?w=680,security-breach,Dropbox is resetting passwords for accounts that haven’t changed them since mid-2012
381,Matthew Lynley,"David Lortscher was one of a few dozen people practicing dermatology in New Mexico when he realized a huge problem in the field: There weren’t enough dermatologists, and people were skipping out on visits because they thought it was for more affluent people or took too long.
So Lortscher decided to start Curology, which provides acne and anti-aging treatment and prescriptions through a visual diagnosis done with your phone, with his brother working remotely in Hong Kong to try to bring dermatological treatment to a more broad audience. Instead of waiting months for an initial appointment for a prescription — and then potentially months after that for a follow-up — the goal for Curology was to get the treatments into the hands of patients as quickly as possible.
Users take a photo of their skin condition, which is uploaded to Curology’s team of dermatological specialists. They then decide on a customized treatment schedule and prescribe medication — generally in the form of a topical acne and anti-aging treatment — and send it to patients for about $20 per month. To do all this, Curology has raised $15 million from Advance Vixeid Partners, along with Forerunner Ventures and Sherpa Capital in a new round of financing.
Curology’s launch highlights some of the challenges of telemedicine. To basically become a fully licensed medical practice that can distribute its treatments, Curology had to become licensed in each individual state. The difficulty of getting each license can vary, but it still is very time intensive and can hamper the launch schedule of companies hoping to get a similar business off the ground.
“At first we were pursuing making a downloadable app, and that didn’t make it into the final experience,” Lortscher said. “We started doing an HTML5 web app, we’re really happy we did because people who did want to sign up for this thing, they don’t want to go through the process of downloading an app first, they want to click right through the browser to get started. I wanted there to not feel like there’s any barriers.”

“We do use photos, those go directly to medical professionals,” Lortscher said. “The interesting thing, you cannot prescribe medication using AI, that is not a thing. It would not be good medicine. These are prescription meds we use, and running that through something without a licensed human making the ultimate decision would be irresponsible.”
The whole process of building the formula wasn’t necessarily easy either. Building the kinds of packaging and products for something like this requires a careful balancing act of ensuring that the ingredients both have a long shelf life and don’t end up deactivating each other. That includes both active and inactive ingredients, and figuring out which agents to use in the first place.
There will be a lot of competition on the horizon. The biggest one is obvious: Proactiv, which has a massive marketing presence across a wide variety of channels and a huge install base already. If Proactiv were to adopt the kind of telemedicine model that Curology is starting to deploy, it could easily start chewing into the market and grow beyond its already sizable customer segment. But Proactiv, and other startups that might expand into acne treatment, isn’t worrying Lortscher — at least not yet.
“That’s something that I’m sure some day will happen, the fact is we have 50 million people in the country with acne, 3 million of which are using Proactiv,” Lortscher said. “That’s way more than we can service in the next 2 years, and way more than Proactiv can service. It would be scary, but I think it would end up being immaterial just because there are so many people with this problem, it’s such a real need someone else taking half of the market isn’t going to materially affect what we do.”
The company is also going to have to be able to train up staff (which isn’t exclusively dermatologists, but are all trained in dermatology and can prescribe treatments) that can quickly adapt to unique cases, like allergic reactions or treatment plans that aren’t working or making things worse.
At the moment — and for the foreseeable future — Curology doesn’t expect to expand beyond its current treatments. That’s both because the market is so large and its current business is much more accessible with visual diagnosis. With those boundary conditions in place, that means that it’s a reasonable model to scale up as it can make the process of diagnosing patients more and more efficient.
Moving forward, it’s time for Curology to start getting the word out there. The company is raising financing right now because it wants to start expanding its marketing — and, of course, the rest of the team, which is five times larger than it was a year ago. Thus far the company has largely grown through word of mouth, but applying similar principles that other pharmaceutical startups have used to grow — like paid acquisition on Facebook and other channels — may help it grow into that 50 million-person market Lortscher talks about.",2016-08-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/620651-958296c75450c7d44735cedc1934bf9e9d57bbed-2.jpg?w=738,"telemedicine,sherpa-ventures,curology,avp",Customized online prescription acne treatment provider Curology raises $15M
382,Matthew Lynley,"While there’s plenty of talent in the San Francisco Bay Area — where Pinterest’s main office is over at 5th and Brannan in San Francisco — it can be very costly to find and recruit that talent. And there’s a lot outside of San Francisco as well.
One city, in particular, that Pinterest has turned its eyes to is Seattle. Last month, it opened an engineering office in the city, and today it said it has hired its first head of engineering, Ruben Ortega, who was most recently the CTO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and an engineering executive at Nordstrom and Google prior to that.

Like looking for talent in cities like New York and other places, building and staffing up these offices serves two purposes: it helps keep talent that don’t necessarily want to move to the Bay Area to be in the mothership, and it also opens an opportunity to poach talent from other companies in an area.
In this case, Microsoft and Amazon can basically serve as an engineering graduate school for many potential candidates for companies based a few states south. Right now, it looks like that’s where things are headed for the office for the time being, with it largely being centered around engineering. But as the company continues to grow and more resources are poured into hiring, looking beyond the Bay Area is one of the first big steps it has to do in order to remain competitive.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-20-at-8-04-13-am.png?w=738,pinterest,Pinterest hires a head of engineering for its new Seattle office
383,Jordan Crook,"Tinder is teaming up with Spotify to give users a new way to judge each other.
Just as Tinder allowed folks to connect their Instagram accounts to their Tinder profile, the same is now true for Spotify. Users will be able to check out each others’ most-played songs on Spotify.
But even if you don’t have Spotify, Tinder will still let you use Spotify to add your ‘Tinder Anthem’ to your profile. Think back to the MySpace days of auto-playing songs on profiles and you’ll have a pretty good idea of what this will feel like.
“Music is an important part of making new connections and getting to know existing ones,” said Tinder CEO Sean Rad. “Just like you go to the bar that plays your favorite music, you’re likely attracted to the people at that bar who enjoy the same music. We want to do the same thing with the Spotify integration.”
Alongside most-played music and Tinder Anthems, Tinder is also launching the TinderMusic account on Spotify. TinderMusic is a set of themes (“Pre-Swipe”, “Discovery”, “Match”, “Love at First Swipe”, and “Date Night”) that will help users find and tailor the right playlist in the moment.
It’s worth noting that Tinder isn’t the first dating app to integrate music tastes through Spotify. Bumble, a competing app that puts the ball in the girl’s court, launched an integration with Spotify back in June, letting users put their top artists inside their profile.
That said, Tinder is the first to let users actually play music within the app as a way to express themselves.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/tinder_spotify_phone_final.png?w=738,,Tinder taps Spotify to let you add music to your profile
384,Ingrid Lunden,"Reports may be swirling about Twitter exploring a sale of all or a part of its company, but in the meantime, the social media platform is trimming down internationally.
Twitter is shutting down its engineering operations out of Bangalore, India, and it is laying off around 20 engineers in the process, the company confirmed to TechCrunch today.
“As part of our normal business review, we have decided to stop the global engineering work at the Bangalore development center,” a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We thank the impacted individuals, less than 20 persons, for their valuable contributions and are doing as much as we can to provide them a respectful exit from our company.” Earlier in the day, Indian press reported that the number would be closer to 100, which Twitter said was incorrect.
The number is a very small percentage of overall staff. The spokesperson said that overall, Twitter employs over 3,800 people internationally, and it doesn’t break them down by markets.
Twitter will continue to operate three offices in the country, in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, with only the engineering team out of Bangalore impacted by the layoffs. “Twitter remains committed to India as a strategic market for users, partners and advertisers,” the spokesperson said. India is one of Twitter’s fastest growing markets worldwide, although Twitter does not break out country-by-country revenues. “We continue to invest in key initiatives to further expand our audience, increase user engagement and drive revenue in this important market,” she added.
She also said that this is not part of a bigger downsizing move affecting other international operations.
Twitter took a big plunge into India when it acquired a startup called ZipDial in January 2015. That startup was co-founded by Valerie Wagoner, a U.S. expat who was based in India. Notably, Wagoner has taken on a wider remit as Twitter’s senior director of growth. She also quietly relocated to the head office in San Francisco some time ago. Twitter has confirmed to us that this is where Wagoner is still working.
As we explained at the time of the acquisition, ZipDial was built to address a uniquely Indian convention: people intentionally call others and hang up before they answer so that the recipient know she/he is trying to be reached, without incurring any extra calling charges. The missed call becomes an alert of sorts, and ZipDial worked with brands and others to essentially develop this into an advertising network and system to sign up for push-based notifications.
Twitter, intent on better tapping into and growing its international audience, snapped up ZipDial as part of a strategy to capture global revenues by offering more localised services, and to pick up more talent in India, well known for its strong computer science talent. Other local moves have included building a data science team in Singapore.
Twitter says that ZipDial’s original team and tech are both appearing in other markets where Twitter is active. “Over the past 18 months, we have incorporated the technology and talent of our ZipDial acquisition across our company,” a second spokesperson at the company told me.
But in the case of India, you might argue that Twitter hasn’t built on its ZipDial buy with more uniquely Indian services.
Cases in point: a lot of the newest initiatives in the country have actually been international roll outs of services created in the U.S., rather than services developed specifically for India.
They include an e-governance partnership with the Uttar Pradesh State Police to use Twitter as a customer service channel via Tweets to their official @UPPolice account; special Twitter emojis to mark Indian cultural moments like Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, and International Day of Yoga; and ad campaigns, such as Pepsi Promoted #Stickers for Indian Twitter users to “Say it with Pepsi.”
Other companies like Facebook have tapped into to international markets to offset slower user growth in more mature markets like the U.S. This seems to be what Twitter has been aiming for, too, but achieving a less strong effect.
In its last quarterly earnings, for example, Twitter reported international (non-U.S.) monthly active users of 247 million for Q2, up 4% year-over-year and up 2 million on the 245 million of Q1. That was only marginally better than 3% growth in the U.S.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/2673098391_c184818403_b-1.jpg?w=738,"india,layoffs,zipdial","Twitter lays off around 20, shuts down engineering in Bangalore, India"
385,Sarah Perez,"Did you hear? Twitter would like you to know that its service is now easier to use, thanks to a series of rule revisions announced in May, which have just gone live. Starting today, Twitter is cutting down on what counts towards your 140 characters. As a refresher, that means media content like photos, videos, GIFs, polls and Quote Tweets no longer eat into your character count. Links still do, however.
As you may recall, Twitter first announced all these changes earlier this year, but delayed their rollout to give the developer community time to adapt.
Along with changing what counts towards the 140 characters, Twitter also announced other tweaks at the same time – like ditching the “.@” format, for example. This convention came about when people wanted to send tweets that began with an “@username” to their entire audience. Something of a user-generated hack, the period “.” circumvented Twitter’s restrictions on which tweets appear in followers’ Timelines.
Twitter likes to tout all these changes as a means of simplifying its service – something it’s doing in an effort to appeal to new users who find the intricacies of using Twitter confusing. Twitter has seen its user growth stagnate, which has been worrying Wall St. and leading to rumors that the service is looking for an acquirer.
The goal with its departure from the 140 characters – Twitter’s defining feature from day one – is to make the service easier to use.
And it’s just so much easier, right?
Right?
In case you need a cheat sheet, here’s a summary of Twitter’s newer, “simpler” rules, including all those announced alongside the character count changes back in May. (See below)
(Note that the RT and QT changes were shipped a few months ago, while the @mentions and “.@” changes are still forthcoming.)
SEE? EASY!!
I mean, really, isn’t this so much better than – oh, I don’t know – just displaying the first 140 characters, then hiding the rest behind a click?
And isn’t this feature set just hugely in demand, even more so than an “edit your tweet” button or some sort of legitimate product built in response to the widespread cyberbullying and trolling that takes place on Twitter…you know, something like what Instagram just launched?
I mean, I don’t hear anyone asking for these things…
Anyway…new ways to reduce character count. Yay.

386,Josh Constine,"The Adblock Plus crowdsourced hacker militia can’t keep up with Facebook’s disciplined army of engineers.
When Facebook first announced it would circumvent ad blocking software, Adblock Plus (ABP) built a workaround in two days, boasting that “We promised that the open source community would have a solution very soon…This time that community seems to have gotten the better of even a giant like Facebook.”
But it’s been a month since Facebook broke ABP’s last workaround, and the social network’s marketing messages are still getting through. Despite the fact that ABP’s browser extension gets the final say on what appears on your screen, it can’t build filters fast enough when Facebook has total control over the code it serves.
ABP parent company Eyeo’s communications and operations manager Ben Williams admits it needs to dig deeper and make more drastic changes to keep fighting Facebook. “They have basically removed every identifier that’s findable in the first level of ads”, he says while raising fear about Facebook’s ads one day being indistinguishable from content to its users as well.
Williams insists his company knew this would happen. “You’ve got to think that a company like Facebook has…a playbook. It’s kind of been how we expected.”
That contrasts with the confidence of Williams’ blog posts a month ago, where he wrote “What we hope users will remember is that there is a gargantuan, unstoppable community” and “Should Facebook circumvent again, I’m sure another solution will arise from that open source community.”
Now ABP says it will need more time to fire back at Facebook. “We’ll have to change the software, and we’re very, very careful. We have to do some testing.” Williams says that though Facebook has scrubbed the parent elements of its ads code, “We’re in the process of being able to block based on the one of the child elements. I’d say we’re a couple weeks away from that.”
In the meantime, ABP has launched its own ad exchange called the Acceptable Ads Platform. It essentially lets websites serve privacy-safe ads that ABP won’t block from appearing to 90 million of its browser extension’s users in exchange for a six percent cut. That money will be critical if Adblock Plus wants to keep funding a war with a tech giant that earns $2 billion in profit per quarter.

387,Sarah Perez,"Twitter today is rolling out a series of new features designed to help users better connect with businesses offering customer support through their official Twitter accounts. Now those businesses will be able to clearly display on their profile if their account offers customer service, as well as which times those accounts are active.
The business can now indicate if it offers service via a new Customer Support settings page on the Twitter Dashboard website. Once enabled, the business’s Twitter profile will read that it “Provides Support.” This option will also turn on the account’s ability to receive Direct Messages from anyone. In other words, the business will no longer need to request that customers follow them back so they can send a private message.

This “Provides support” detail will also show when people search for accounts — including when they @mention the company in a tweet, for example, or begin typing a Direct Message.
In addition, the business can also now choose to display the hours of customer service availability on its profile, which will help set expectations in terms of when a reply may be received.
When customers visit these customer service Twitter accounts, they’ll also see a new, more prominent button to start a Direct Message with the business in question.
TechCrunch had previously reported on the larger Direct Messages button’s existence when the company was testing the feature in the wild. Accounts like @AppleSupport, @Uber_Support, @BeatsSupport, @ATVIAssist (Activision Support) and others were among the early testers. T-Mobile, which is highly active on Twitter, has also adopted the new features.

As we noted at the time, the rollout of the larger Direct Messages button — which takes over the full space where the “Tweet to” and “Message” buttons used to live side-by-side — encourages users to start a private conversation with the business instead of publicly tweeting at them. This could move to the business’s private channel some of the more negative comments that frustrated customers make on Twitter.
The changes also position Twitter to better compete with Facebook, which had rolled out a feature to its Pages users in the past that showed Facebook users how responsive the business is to customer inquires. (However, the most recent Page redesign seems to have done away with this informational text for the time being.)
The new additions follow on other customer service features Twitter had previously launched, including Direct Message links and Customer Feedback cards.",2016-09-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/twitter-140-media.png?w=738,,Twitter rolls out new features for businesses running customer service accounts
388,Sarah Perez,"Following the controversial firing of the editorial team who managed the Trending Topics that appear next to Facebook’s News Feed, the company is now actively working on technology that will help prevent fake news stories from showing up in the Trending section. Similar systems have been rolled out to News Feed in recent months, and now that same technology is making its way to Trending, said Facebook’s News Feed head, Adam Mosseri, at TechCrunch Disrupt SF this morning.
The social network came under attack earlier this year for allegedly suppressing conservative news from appearing in the Trending Topics section. While it was later discovered that this was largely due to individual judgement, not institutional bias, the company took the heavy-handed measure of letting the entire team of Trending Topics news curators go.
Explained Mosseri, Facebook made this decision because “we wanted to be clear – in the wake of a lot of feedback – about our role and the role of people in the Trending product.”
That being said, the remaining product, which is now entirely driven by algorithms, has become much worse, many say. It has even allowed fake news stories to show up as trending topics – something a human-powered editorial team would likely catch.
But Mosseri said it’s not the lack of human editors to blame for the mistakes that led to things like a fake, sensational story about Fox News’ Megyn Kelly to show up in Trending. Instead, he said that’s the sort of problem that could have happened before the change.
“That doesn’t mean it’s okay,” he admitted.
With no more human editors helping to curate what appears in the Trending section, Facebook also believes it will be easier to scale the product to its international users.
One issue with the earlier version of Trending was that the captions that explained the stories were only in English, Mosseri noted.
“A system where we talk about the topic and the number of people speaking about the topic actually scales better internationally,” said Mosseri, “and we care a lot about scaling.”
“We tried to make sure we have one experience that adapts based on people’s usage across the world, and not to have different types of products in different countries – that becomes much more difficult to maintain and execute on,” he added.
Of course, Trending still needs a lot of work. But one of Facebook’s core values is the belief in iteration. While Trending has failed in some fairly significant ways in recent days – including also promoting a false, 9/11 “truther” story – the company plans to upgrade the product by rolling out technology similar to what it uses in News Feed today.
For News Feed, Facebook has developed systems to suppress fake stories, hoaxes and clickbait, and now it plans to roll out the same thing to Trending.
“We’ve actually spent a lot of time on News Feed to reduce [fake stories and hoaxes’] prevalence in the ecosystem,” said Mosseri. “We’re doing now some more similar work in Trending to improve the experience in a similar way.”
That said, the work is far from being complete
“There’s a lot of room for improvement, not only with Trending but also with News Feed,” he said.",2016-09-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/disrupt_sf16_adam_mosseri-4017.jpg?w=738,,Facebook to roll out tech for combating fake stories in its Trending topics

At TechCrunch Disrupt SF, writer Josh Constine sat down with Adam Mosseri, a VP at Facebook and head of News Feed, to hear more about how policies control what you see.
The talk started with Constine asking Mosseri much content people consume daily on their News Feed. Mosseri shared a new statistic, which is that the average Facebook users reads a little over 200 stories a day on their feed, which is about 10 percent of the 2,000 possible stories Facebook has to show them each day.
The average user consumes this News Feed content over 45 minutes a day. This number is still growing, which Mosseri says the company interprets as a signal that they are making News Feed better every day.
The conversation then moved to what kind of content is shared on Facebook most, original sharing (like photos of your friends) or a publisher sharing a story (like CNN). Mosseri noted that both types of sharing were still growing, but publisher sharing is growing at a much faster rate – which could explain why the average users may feel like their News Feed is dominated by content from big new publications.
But Mosseri also said that the company definitely understands that friends and family come first and seeing content from loved ones is why many people come to Facebook in the first place. So they are going to ensure there is a good mix, and content from your friends remains on your feed.
Constine then asked about internet addiction amongst users and if it is something Facebook is concerned about. Mosseri replied that while they don’t track addiction they track a user’s sentiment, and try to understand if people think their News Feed experience is time well spent. Essentially they aren’t worried about someone using Facebook too much (and getting addicted) as long as the person is having a meaningful experience.
When asked about Facebook firing its team of description-writing curators, and the impact on its Trending Topics product, Mosseri said “I think it’s better”. But he conceded that the product needs to improve its ability to block fake news, and says tech that Facebook built to squash hoaxes in the News Feed is being rolled out to Trending Topics now.
The talk ended by the two discussing the Philando Castile shooting video which Facebook had at first temporarily removed from the site, then replaced it saying a “technical glitch” was to blame for its short removal. Mosseri clarified that this glitch was Facebook’s algorithms miscategorizing the content and accidentally flagging it as something else, not a technical glitch like a server going down. ”
This brings up the question what place does Facebook have to censor content? While the company insists it’s not a media company, it effectively fills the shoes of an editor saying “yes or no” to each specific piece of content. If Facebook thinks something is important enough to see, even if it violates standard News Feed guidelines, they will still allow it – placing them in a position that is pretty damn close to being a media company.",2016-09-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/disrupt_sf16_adam_mosseri-4011.jpg?w=738,"social-networking,photo-sharing,adam-mosseri",Facebook denies it’s a media company despite censorship decisions
390,Matthew Lynley,"Twitter needs to figure out a way to continue to grow — and it certainly seems open to looking into a lot of new places outside your phone to figure out how to do that.
Today, the company said it is launching an app on the Apple TV, Xbox One and Amazon Fire TV, which will allow users to view Twitter content through the apps on their televisions. That includes live streams of 10 NFL Thursday Night Football games, as well as other live streaming footage available on Twitter. On the Apple TV, users will be able to view live streaming and top tweets side-by-side on their televisions, as well as top Vines and Periscopes.
So this is an interesting one for a couple of reasons: First, it opens up a whole world of live streaming content to Apple TV and such owners. That’s going to be a boon for cord cutters that are always on the hunt for new content, and as Twitter continues to sign new partnerships with organizations like the NFL for additional live streams, it’s going to open a lot of doors to new content for people who aren’t interested in investing in cable subscriptions.

Secondly, and also eyebrow-raising, the company said that people don’t need a Twitter account, nor cable or satellite subscriptions, to access HD Streams. It’s worth paying attention to its so-called logged-out users, which are harder to track and target due to a lack of an interest graph. But those users can still consume Twitter content — and a lot of that content is likely consumed through distribution in front of logged-out users.

For example, just a few days ago Twitter launched an Alexa app. With that app, users can listen to the latest tweets and contents through an Echo speaker. Again, we’re talking about a new form factor — and it again shows that Twitter is clearly interested in looking beyond just the traditional second screen experience it’s been known for. (It also speaks to the increasing importance of the Alexa ecosystem, but that’s a bit of a different story.)
As usual, the more eyeballs it attracts, the more advertising it can attract and partnerships it can continue to sign if it shows that it’s able to create a highly engaged audience around live events. An app tied to live streaming on the Apple TV, of course, makes a lot of sense because live events have always been Twitter’s sweet spot, whether that’s the Super Bowl or the Olympics, or the election.
Twitter’s core app growth is clearly stalling a bit — and it’s punishing the company, with its stock down almost 35% in the past year, and plenty of quarterly misses to go along with it. It’s going to have to get creative in order to re-ignite growth and show the world, and Wall Street, that it can be a strong independent company that can deliver positive results. And that willingness to step out of a comfort zone may be a good sign that, at the very least, they’re going to look for the next generation of the Twitter experience beyond just 140 characters.",2016-09-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/tvos-video-timeline.jpg?w=738,"tvos,fire-tv","Twitter launches on Apple TV, Fire TV and Xbox One"
391,Brian Heater,"Two-time NBA MVP Stephen Curry closed out the second day of Disrupt San Francisco by discussing his recent forays into technology investments and charitable organizations, kicking things off by talking Slyce, the social media startup he co-founded with former Davidson teammate Bryant Barr.
“We met back in 2005,” the Splash Brother explained. “He left to go back to Nike and obviously I came out here to play basketball. We started brainstorming the idea two years ago to leverage off of my social media presence and the ways athletes interact with fans and sponsors off the court.”

Curry and Barr launched the platform back in March. The platform is designed to serve as a conduit between big names like professional athletes and their fanbases, removing some of the trappings of traditional social media in the process.
Curry added that social media was a “life and death situation,” with a smile, singling out Instagram as his favorite app, toward the end of the conversation, before adding, “and Slyce,” naturally.
Curry was also on-hand to discuss Nothing But Nets, a UN Foundation organization the player is involved with that was launched to raise awareness about – and fight – malaria.

“I was introduced to the cause in college, as well,” Curry explained. There was an event that Barr ran, a three-on-three to raise money to fight malaria. So, when Nothing But Nets approached me, it made perfect sense. Knowing the stats around malaria, how many children are affected by the disease. I have two daughters myself, and I know the feeling of wanting to protect them.”
As part of his involvement, Curry donates three malaria nets for everything three-pointer he scores during the season – a tall order for the all-time leader. “402 [three-pointers last year],” he said with a chuckle. “That’s a lot of nets.”

Curry also praised The Warriors’ aggressive push into training technologies like motion trackers. Asked what technology he’d be most interested in incorporating into his regiment, he joked, “One would be to just help me dunk more. I can’t do that. Something you can put in your calf.” As for whether he’d be okay with robots replaces refs, he added, “I would love that. But I would have to throw my mouthpiece at those new inventions.”
In a quick lightning round, Curry chose Uber over Lyft (“Those rides with drivers are amazing. They’re the biggest fans.”), Space Jam over Air Bud, Clinton over Trump, Giants over A’s (as a Red Sox fan) and Magic over Bird. As for Star Wars or Star Trek, “Neither,” he admitted. “I’m not into it.” He did, however, manage to drop a little My Little Pony knowledge, name-checking Fluttershy Rainbow Dash — “I’ve got two daughters,” he laughed. “I told you.”",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/disrupt_sf16_stephen_curry-3907.jpg?w=738,"techcrunch-disrupt,slyce,stephen-curry","Stephen Curry on social media, charity and robotic referees"
392,Josh Constine,"Facebook Messenger has built an unlaunched feature called Rooms that lets groups publicly chat about different subjects and events. Buried in Messenger’s iOS app’s source code are multiple references to the feature, with some explanation of how it works.
The code shows: “Introducing rooms”, “Rooms are for public conversations about topics and interests. Each room has a link that can be shared so anyone on Messenger can join the conversation”. You can apparently start your own Rooms as well. The blue circle image above is listed as a Rooms logo in the code (the darker background and illustration of a home is ours).
TechCrunch received a tip off about the code from developer evangelist Chris Messina. When we asked Facebook if it was building a Messenger Rooms feature, the company told me “We don’t have any comment on this speculation.” However, here are screenshots of the excavated Messenger code about Rooms:
 
 
 
 
 
 
[Update 11:15am PT: After being shown the screenshots of the code, Facebook provided a different statement, saying “We often run small tests – nothing else to share beyond that.”]
[Update 12:10pm PT: TechCrunch has now attained screenshots of the Messenger Rooms feature from our reader Hoan Do.
The screenshots show how users can join public rooms, chat with friends as well as strangers using the standard Messenger interface and features, how to manage a Room, and the ability to share the Room to get other people to join. You can try joining a Room with this link.
The Messenger Rooms feature is reminiscent of the standalone Rooms app that Facebook launched in 2014 but shut down in 2015. It let people be pseudonymous and join interest-based discussion groups. It didn’t receive much widespread traction, though, and was removed from the app store.
Rooms might not be available to any users or could be in very limited testing. It might never roll out more widely depending on user reactions. But the feature could help Facebook fill in the middle-ground between broad News Feed sharing to your whole social graph, and private messaging to your closest friends. Rooms could become the Messenger counterpart to Facebook’s popular Groups feature that’s grown to see over 1 billion monthly active users.
Rooms could unlock more engagement on Facebook about niche topics that most of your friends might not care about, but someone out there does. While Groups is great for threaded posts about a topic, those don’t quite feel alive. Rooms could capture the fast-moving, fun conversations that once lived in the chat rooms of web 1.0.",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/facebook-messenger-rooms.png?w=738,facebook-messenger,Facebook Messenger’s source code reveals hidden Rooms feature
393,Jordan Crook,"Foursquare has today unveiled Foursquare 10, a redesigned version of the app that puts search front and center.
J Crowley, head of product at Foursquare, told TechCrunch that most people get on Foursquare with a clear intent, making the original featured content on the homepage mostly irrelevant.
“Previous versions of the products were based on the theory that people wanted a laid back user experience, so we showed them top picks and places they should try,” said Crowley. “We learned through research and feedback that our users have clear intent when they open Foursquare, and our new homepage better serves that intent.”
The new homepage offers a much faster search, with five chiclets that represent the six most popular searches: breakfast, lunch, dinner, nightlife, coffee/tea, and things to do.
The company is also working to build on the trust it already has from users. Now, when a user posts a review on Foursquare, the app will show how many times that user has actually been to that location. That way, folks reading the reviews will be able to tell which ones come from ‘verified’ users and which aren’t.
Foursquare is also working to better understand where you are, not only with the results it serves up, but right within the homepage. For example, users who just flew to London will be welcomed to foggy London town with a big banner. The app will also understand when it’s Ice Cream Day or Burger Day and offer a banner to click relevant places.
The last addition to Foursquare 10 comes with the launch of iOS 10, as Foursquare is adding rich text notifications for folks who are sharing Foursquare places. Instead of a simple link, users will be able to share place previews, complete with photos, without having to unlock their phones.

394,Sarah Perez,"Confirming earlier reports that YouTube was planning to introduce more social networking features to its service, the company announced this morning the launch of YouTube Community, which allows video creators to better engage viewers using text, GIFs, images and more. The goal with the new features is to help keep creators from departing to competing platforms by offering more tools for connecting with their audience, beyond the videos themselves.
YouTube has been testing the new service over the past several months with a handful of creators in order to gain feedback. Today, it’s launching the service into public beta with this group of early testers, and will make it available to a wider group of creators in the “months ahead,” it says.

Access to this expanded feature set is made available to the creators and their viewers by way of a new “Community” tab on their channels.
From here, creators can share things like text posts, images, GIFs and other content, which the audience can thumbs up and down, like the videos themselves, as well as comment on.
Viewers will see these posts in their “Subscriptions” feed in the YouTube mobile application, and can also choose to receive push notifications on these posts from their favorite creators, YouTube says.
Early adopters of YouTube Community include John & Hank Green, AsapSCIENCE, The Game Theorists, Karmin, The Key of Awesome, The Kloons, Lilly Singh, Peter Hollens, Rosianna Halse Rojas, Sam Tsui, Threadbanger, and Vsauce3.
For example, on the vlogbrothers’ channel (John & Hank Green), the video creators say they’ll use the Community page to inform their fans about updates to their channels, events, and other fun links and photos they’ve been collecting.
Effectively, this Community page allows the creators to run a mini-social network of sorts on their channel’s page. This is an important move for Google, which has historically struggled to get social right, as seen with the failure of its Facebook competitor Google+. The company once tried to bake Google+ into YouTube itself, with disastrous results. (It finally rolled back that integration last year.)
In terms of making YouTube more of a social community than it already is, the Community tab makes more sense than a destination social network like Google+, as it effectively gives the creators the ability to talk directly to their fan base, and drive sort of social engagement the company desires.
YouTube says its Community feature will remain in testing for the time being, as it listens to feedback and rolls out new features and functionality. A broader rollout is planned for the months ahead, but no exact ETA was given.",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/youtube-logo.jpg?w=738,social,YouTube gets its own social network with the launch of YouTube Community
395,Jordan Crook,"Confide, the confidential messaging app that launched back in 2013, has today announced an integration with iMessage in iOS 10.
As part of iOS 10’s new iMessage features, which incorporates apps right within the iMessage application, Confide users will be able to send self-destructing messages direct from their texts.
Confide for iMessage will support text and pictures, using Confide’s familiar wand functionality, where users can only see the text over which they drag their finger.
Confide for iMessage requires that both users already have the app.
The company has grown quite a bit in the past few years, raising a total of $3.6 million in funding from investors like Google Ventures, CrunchFund, and First Round Capital.
The native Confide app goes beyond iMessage functionality to support docs and voice chat, and the team is currently working on video support.
Along with Confide for iMessage, the company is also launching Siri support, letting users ask to send a Confide to a friend with only their voice.

396,Katie Roof,"Just 2 percent of applicants got accepted to appear in the Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt SF; Pundit was one of the teams to make the cut. The company debuted their audio social media platform on stage, presenting it to a panel of judges.
Co-founders Billy Shaw Susanto and Chris Aston told TechCrunch that they believe their forum for “bite-sized talkshows” will be used by young millennials who are looking to make voice chat more fun. “Unleash your inner Oprah,” Susanto said on stage.
They hope that filters such as monster and robot voices set this apart from traditional voice messaging apps. Pundit encourages users to send short sound bites to their followers or via private message.
“Anchor and many of those voice apps out there really focus on making broadcasting as utilitarian as possible, but the thing that’s missing is the lack of fun and the lack of conversation,” said Aston.
“Music, photos and videos have all been reinvented,” so it’s time to “create a social platform for voice experiences,” said Susanto. 
The team recently graduated from NYU and has already secured a $120,000 investment from the Disney TechStars accelerator. Disney has had some of their top stars do AMAs on Pundit. They hope to eventually introduce voice filters so that people can sound like their favorite characters.
“Voice and audio is the last frontier for innovation in social media right now,” said Aston, and he believes Pundit has what it takes to change things.
The winner of San Francisco’s Startup Battlefield 2016 will be announced on Wednesday.

397,Matthew Lynley,"Silicon Valley has a huge diversity problem, but a blunt instrument hiring quotas for diverse candidates still isn’t the answer, according to Slack head of engineering Leslie Miley. Instead, Silicon Valley — and Slack — have to get inventive, and look in some non-obvious places, to figure out how to bring in candidates that are outside the traditional Silicon Valley entrepreneur.
But that quotas are even in the conversation is just another example that diversity in Silicon Valley is a huge problem, and Slack is doing a lot to level the playing field, as Miley says. The company has blind coding test examinations for potential candidates, they look outside of Silicon Valley (Miley noted they just brought in someone from Tennessee) and is now opening an office in Toronto, another highly diverse city, Miley said.

Slack has been very vocal about its efforts to promote a diverse culture at the company — and Miley is probably one of the best-suited people in the discussion. The company has made a lot of effort to branch out into regions outside of Silicon Valley in order to attract talent in regions that are outside the traditional Silicon Valley mold. And it’s looking outside the traditional places that Silicon Valley giants, startups and venture capitalists may be pattern-matching into the best candidates.
That includes looking in unexpected areas in the United States, too, including cities like Detroit, Richmond or even Nashville, Miley said. Those cities are plenty diverse and also have a large pool of highly diverse and talented candidates, and Slack is doing what it can to expand into those areas. And larger tech companies should be doing the same thing, he said.
“[Large tech companies] don’t need to set up shop at the same scale,” Miley said. “Could you put 200 people, definitely, it’s a drop in the hat for Google or Facebook, it’s actually cost competitive to areas in India and China. I’ve had teams, managed over 100 people in India, I know what the cost structure looks like… [Then] people who want advancement know they have to come to HQ, you have people coming to Cupertino, Mountain View. What happens when you hire diverse people — they talk to their friends, their network looks like them. They’re gonna hire friends, associates, you start to make inroads in this company.”
A big part of the issue is that networks within companies tend to self-select within their own networks, keeping diverse candidates from coming into the company. That leads to a reinforcing cycle where diverse candidates from different regions and backgrounds, which might bring in their own friends to the companies, might not feel welcome in those companies. For Slack, this is something the company has been trying to do from day one, which makes it easier to attract that kind of talent when getting the ball rolling while the company is small, Miley said.
There are, of course, a lot of efforts being made by larger technology companies. For example, Pinterest and Facebook institute the “Rooney Rule” or something similar, in which companies ensure they consider at least one minority candidate for open positions. But in some cases there’s more work to be done, Miley said.
“There’s an organization called fwd.us, a group set up by a diverse group of entrepreneurs, and they are looking to raise H-1B visa cap — I support that, I think it’s great,” Miley said. “They got together to raise H-1B, the lobbying firms for these companies, spending millions per quarter, up to $12 million a year on raising H-1B, why don’t we have something like that for increasing diversity and inclusion? I think that’s a place you can start. You get people doing something like that and apply it to the U.S., to less diverse areas. Big Silicon Valley firms are, of course, trying. But sometimes those attempts can be a little ham-handed.”

398,Sarah Perez,"Twitter is increasing its focus on live streaming today with the launch of a new Notification button on its app that lets you subscribe to be alerted when someone you follow starts live-streaming. When you receive the alert, you can immediately join the broadcast with just a tap. The feature works both for alerting users to new streams from Periscope, as well as for content from Twitter’s live streaming partners, such as the NFL.
This feature was spotted earlier this month during testing. However, when BuzzFeed reported on the new addition’s existence, Twitter disabled the button and then told reporters that it was simply “experimenting with different ways to discover live video on Twitter.”
Twitter did not comment on the earlier report when asked about the launch today. However, we’ve confirmed with sources familiar with the new feature that it has now officially gone live for all users worldwide.
The company has also tweeted out on its official account how to go about enabling the new Notification option for yourself.
The company explains that the new button will appear at the top-right of the screen, next to the Follow button on a user’s Profile. You can tap this button to subscribe to alerts from the Twitter user in question. When doing so, a dialog box that appears that lets you choose to receive notifications on “All Tweets,” or choose “Only tweets with live video.” You can also switch off notifications entirely by selecting “None.”
If the account you’re tracking then goes live, you’ll get an alert in the app if you have it open, or sent to your phone via a push notification, otherwise. When you tap the notification, you’re directed to the tweet including the live Periscope video.
Live video is large part of Twitter’s shifting strategy these days. The company has forged deals this year with Wimbledon, the NFL to stream Thursday Night Football, Pac-12 Networks for college sports, CBSN for convention coverage, and Bloomberg for financial news. And today, Twitter and news startup Cheddar announced a similar partnership on a live streaming deal which will see the network’s financial news show “Closing Bell” exclusively stream on Twitter from 3 to 4 P.M. ET, beginning in October.
Twitter’s own live streaming service Periscope, meanwhile, has faced increased competition from Facebook Live Video in recent days, as Twitter continues to struggle with growing its stagnant user base and revenue. Twitter-owned Periscope beat Facebook to market with live video, but in the days since, Facebook has invested heavily in its live streaming feature, with the launch of new creative expression features, an API to help broadcasters use professional equipment, support for two-person broadcasts, waiting rooms and more.

399,Steve O'Hear,"French food delivery startup FoodChéri, which operates an online only restaurant along the lines of EatFirst in the UK or Munchery’s original model in the US, has raised €6 million in Series A funding led by 360 Capital Partners, and Breega Capital.

Also noteworthy is that Samaipata Ventures is already an investor in Jinn, the Europe same-hour delivery startup, which counts food delivery as one of its most popular categories.
Currently serving 1,000 meals per day to “busy professionals” in Paris and various suburbs, including Neuilly-sur-Seine, Levallois, Boulogne-Billancourt, and Issy-les-Moulineaux, FoodChéri lets you order fresh chef-prepared meals that are chilled and ready to reheat and consume upon delivery.
It’s a model that avoids some of the pitfalls faced by restaurant delivery services, such as UberEATs and Deliveroo, in that orders can be pooled for delivery as food doesn’t need to be delivered hot. FoodChéri also enables orders to be placed “on-demand” or days in advance.
“[We help] city dwellers eat fresher, healthier home-style meals with the convenience of fast food delivered to your doorstep,” explains FoodChéri co-founder and CEO Patrick Asdaghi, who was previously CMO of La Fourchette.
“We solve it with a ‘full-stack’ food operation, from creating the recipe and preparing the ingredients to last-mile delivery, and everything in between”.
Asdaghi tells me the initial focus for FoodChéri was serving dinner for busy professionals, but in April 2016 added lunches. The startup also targets smaller companies that don’t have their own cafeterias or are looking to provide an alternative and healthier lunch option for staff.

“Many of our customers work full-time and don’t always have the time or energy to make their own meals, or want a change from the local cafeteria or snack shop, but still want to eat well without exploding their budget. In France our main competitor is Frichti even though they have a slightly different positioning in terms of the food offering”, he adds.
Meanwhile, FoodChéri says the funds will primarily be used to extend delivery areas within the Greater Paris region before potential international expansion. In addition, the startup plans to spend on recruitment to add a further dozen or so staff to its current 40 person headcount, and for further product development.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/team-couleur.jpg?w=738,,French online restaurant FoodChéri raises €6M Series A
400,Romain Dillet,"French startup StarOfService just raised another $10 million for its European Thumbtack alternative. Andrea Piccioni and Silvio Pagliani, ENERN Investments and Point Nine Capital participated in today’s round, as well as various business angels.
When I first covered StarOfService, the company didn’t even try to hide from me that it was a Thumbtack copycat. The main difference is that Thumbtack is still only available in the U.S. StarOfService has used this opportunity to get customers in untapped markets.
Here’s a quick recap in case you aren’t familiar with the Thumbtack model. If you need to hire a plumber, a guitar teacher, a photographer and more, you can tell the platform what you’re looking for. Over the next 24 hours, professionals can bid on your request. The client can finally pick a service provider based on reviews and quotes.
While this system might not be efficient enough if there’s a giant leak in your bathroom or you’re in the middle of a power outage, many projects require you to find the right person — for home improvement, event-based and teaching jobs, waiting a day or two before connecting with the right professional seems fair.
And it seems to be working as the startup has generated around $900 million (€800 million) in business volume — StarOfService takes a cut from this number. The startup has developed specific websites for Italy, Spain, Germany, the U.K., Poland, Australia, Canada, Turkey, Brazil, India and France.
Even though StarOfService started as a copycat, it looks like the startup has bigger ambitions now. It seemed unrealistic a couple of years ago, but maybe the startup now has a shot at becoming the global leader in this market — minus the U.S.
While Thumbtack has a ton of funding, if the company doesn’t expand internationally quickly enough, there might not be enough room to compete properly with StarOfService outside of the U.S.
With today’s funding round, StarOfService plans to expand internationally more aggressively. This kind of companies require a lot of capital for search engine optimization, online ads and recruiting professionals. And if this expansion is working, it’s just step one as there should be more expansion pushes in the future.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/starofservice.jpg?w=738,"france-newsletter,starofservice",StarOfService raises $10 million for its service marketplace
401,Natasha Lomas,"Airbnb is facing a further squeeze on its activities in Barcelona, the Catalonian capital that’s hugely popular with tourists — ramping up tension with local communities dealing with inflating rents and rowdy behavior by visitors facilitated by the rapid rise of sharing-economy platforms.
The city has been trying to crack down on illegal tourist rentals for some time, with the incoming mayor Ada Colau putting a temporary cap on the number of new registrations for rentals last year — a moratorium that was extended this summer. It is not currently possible to legally get a license for a new holiday rental in Barcelona.
But the council is now stepping up enforcement activity, sending letters to residents asking them to report a property if they suspect it is being illegally rented to tourists.
The municipal mailshot, which has begun with residents of barrios Eixample, Gracia and Sants-Montjuïc but will extend to the whole city by next month, follows an announcement last month by the council that it would be stepping up its crackdown on illegal home rentals in the city.
Earlier in the summer the city government also elected to raise ten-fold the maximum possible fine for apartments rented to tourists that are not on the Catalan Tourism Register (RTC), from €60,000 to €600,000. It’s using a regional tourism law to try to control home-sharing activity in the city.
At the end of last year the council fined Airbnb and another home-sharing platform, Expedia-owned HomeAway, €60,000 each for advertising homes not registered with the RTC, and for not responding to requests to provide details on homes advertised without RTC numbers.
Earlier this month a study commissioned by the council suggested that almost 40 percent of the supply of tourist apartments in Barcelona is illegal. It also noted sharp rental rises (of 33 percent) in the city in the last three years — the largest rent inflation in Spain — which it blamed on vacation tourists restricting the supply of accommodations.
“Barcelona City Council works to ensure that tourism activities are compatible with a sustainable urban model,” the council writes in the letter it is sending to residents, adding that it wants to be a city “open to tourism, but with clear rules of behavior.”
It goes on to say it will be stepping up its activities to combat illegal tourist rentals, and asks residents to help it identify illegal rentals by reporting any suspect properties — either by phoning a freedom telephone number or using a web form (available in Catalan, Spanish, English, French and German).
The website also allows residents to check whether an address is legally rented for tourism purposes or not.
It’s a similar move to Berlin’s city council, which encourages residents to file (anonymous) reports online if they suspect neighbors of operating illegal rents — although Berlin has taken an even tougher stance against the likes of Airbnb. A 2014 housing law change in the city, which came into force this May, bans operating short-term tourist rentals of entire apartments without a permit — allowing Berlin’s government to shut off all new activity on the home-sharing platform. (Although the renting of private rooms in apartments is still allowed without a license).
A quick search for a weekend rental for this month on Airbnb yields more than 300 results for Barcelona (and for Paris), but far fewer for Berlin, with Airbnb noting that “only 11 per cent of listing remain for those dates” for Berlin. So while the latter’s crackdown appears to be having a major impact on Airbnb’s inventory, Barcelona’s efforts to reduce illegal tourist rentals that have flourished on platforms such as Airbnb appears to have been fairly ineffective thus far.

Paris’ city council has also released a map of legal tourist rentals in the city in an effort to combat illegal activity.
Last month, Barcelona’s town hall ordered 256 apartments to be removed from home-sharing platforms such as Airbnb, according to Reuters, and said it was investigating more than 400 other potential offenders.
It remains to be seen whether a mailshot to all residents asking them to inform on neighbors illegally using the platform will cause a substantial number of hosts to think twice. (Or else get more creative about how they use the platform — such as by offering 30-day contracts and cancelling after a few days once a tourist leaves).
In its recent study, the city council estimated that Barcelona has 15,881 tourist apartments, 9,606 of which are licensed — meaning 6,275 are illegal.
In a press release today, the council provided an update on its activities, saying it issued removal orders against 615 illegal flats during July and August — meaning a total of 1,290 cases have been opened following the announcement that it would be stepping up inspections this summer.
It added that a total of 960 complaints about illegal rentals have been received since it opened up the web complaint form two months ago, although it said the total number of complaints and suggestions is higher still, at 1,123.
According to municipal data, the number of people using Airbnb in Barcelona has tripled to 900,000 in the three years prior to 2015.
Responding to the city council’s latest action, Airbnb in a statement accused the council of having a contradictory policy toward tourism, and called for “clear rules” to define “bad actors.”
It said:
For its part, Airbnb claims it has around 21,000 active listings in Barcelona, with the typical host in the city earning €5,100 per year, and the majority (73 percent of hosts) listing just one property — although that leaves close to one-third of Airbnb hosts in the city renting multiple properties, suggesting plenty of residents are using the platform to act as professional landlords, rather than sharing their actual home.
In its press release today, Barcelona city council warned that platforms that continue to advertise tourist rentals without RTC will be asked to collaborate with the administration and withdraw the ads. If they do not, they face being slapped with the new higher fine of up to €600,000.
In addition, tourist rentals that do not respond promptly to resident complaints relating to activities at their property also face disciplinary procedures under the crackdown, including fines of up to €1,000. The council has set up a dedicated call center to field such complaints.
The city council confirmed to TechCrunch it is not currently regulating tourist rentals where a person rents a room or rooms in the address where they also live. Its actions are being targeted against entire apartment rentals. However a spokesman noted that it is currently drafting new tourism regulations which will include room rentals, and allow for each municipality to regulate this type of rental in future.

402,Romain Dillet,"In case you missed it, Aircall announced last week that it had raised another $8 million dollars in funding for its call center software-as-a-service. Balderton Capital is leading this Series A round, with New York-based VC firm FJLabs and existing investors also investing.
I’m a bit late to the news because last week was TechCrunch Disrupt SF. It’s worth mentioning that because Aircall also participated in the Startup Battlefield at Disrupt SF a year ago. But Aircall has grown quite a lot since then.
The company started in 2014 and was a simple software-as-a-service for support teams. You could create virtual phone numbers in many different countries and manage calls with different people answering — a sort of modern call center for small support teams. The company raised $800,000 from eFounders and business angels at the time.
Aircall has then drastically improved call quality, added features to make it easier for bigger teams, added integrations with popular services, such as Salesforce or Zendesk and launched mobile apps. The company also raised $2.75 million from Balderton Capital, FundersClub and business angels in January 2016.
There are now many different features when it comes to setting up your call center. You can decide opening hours, add a custom waiting music, distribute calls, record calls, queue customers, transfer calls and more. And with today’s new funding round coming just a few months after the previous one, it confirms what I’ve heard about the company’s incredible growth rate.
Following this round, the French company plans to expand in the U.S. with a new office in New York. Co-founder and CEO Olivier Pailhes plans to move there. The team of 30 will double over the next twelve months. Aircall now has 2,000 customers.

403,Mike Butcher,"In the ‘old days’ there were plenty of messaging apps and aggregators, but they survived in an open source world. Today, business models dictate that platforms like Slack must keep their messages to themselves.
It would be nice if open-source alternatives could bring back the days of flexibility, combined with today’s world of excellent user experience. What if Slack were simply an excellent tool running on an underlying open-source platform? Could it create the same value?
Riot (formerly known as Vector while it was running in Beta) is a new UK-borne app hoping to have a crack at that.
It’s aiming to bring conversations and productivity tools together, across different apps, and providing the ability to tweak and host your own version by being open source, while also being secure. Riot is built on Matrix, an open standard for decentralized persistent communication.
Riot lets teams share data and collaborate on projects across different communication apps and third party tools. It uses Matrix to bridge to external networks such as Slack, IRC, Twitter and Gitter.
It also offers hosted integrations to third party apps like GitHub, Jira and Jenkins, and relies on Matrix for bots and other integrations development.
Because it’s run on Matrix, Riot has end-to-end encryption using Matrix’s Megolm, an advanced cryptographic ratchet. Teams can therefore choose to run their own server for added company security compliancy.
Users can jump into any public room listed in the directory, or private ones via a link, and start collaborating. New room participants can be invited by email and any guest user can then decide to upgrade and sign up for a Riot account. It’s not unlike how Redhat commercialised Linux.
Competitors in this space might be Slack, Whatsapp, Telegram and other messaging and collaboration apps. But if they are not service your needs and you’d prefer to tap into an open-source method of doing things, Riot is an option.
A word of caution however: It’s currently better suited to developer teams and tech startups than it is to, say, corporate environments that will prefer the slickness of Slack.
Riot is currently free, and the basic service will probably remain so, but it has plans to offer paid additional hosted services like optional integrations and bigger storage options.
Right now Riot is a product of Vector Creations Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the publicly-floated Amdocs, but assuming it takes off the founders Gary Miles, Amandine Le Pape and Matthew Hodgson could well take it in a different direction. It’s no coincidence that Riot runs on Matrix as Hodgson, the Riot CTO, is the technical lead on Matrix.org.
For now, it is what it is and an alternative to other platforms out there.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/riot-android.jpg?w=738,,"Riot wants to be like Slack, but with the flexibility of an underlying open source platform"
404,Steve O'Hear,"DueCourse, a cloud-based invoice financing service for SMEs, has raised £6.25 million in new funding. Backers include GFC (the venture arm of Rocket Internet), Alex Chesterman (founder and CEO of Zoopla), and Simon Franks (co-founder of Lovefilm, acquired by Amazon). Also noteworthy is that the new capital is a split between £1.25 million of equity and £5 million of debt.
The latter is a reflection of the Manchester, UK company’s business model: it lets small- to medium-sized businesses access cash tied up in their yet-to-be-paid invoices. But, rather than operating a peer-to-peer lending marketplace, DueCourse is doing the lending, hence its own debt-financing.
“We allow small businesses using cloud accounting the ability to access the money tied-up in their unpaid invoices whenever they like, in just a few clicks,” explains DueCourse co-founder and CEO Paul Haydock. “The product is free to install, setup takes minutes, and any money requested is then in their bank account within an hour”.
The ability for SMEs to access invoice financing at such a speedy rate is born out of DueCourse’s use of data and its own risk models. This includes pulling in data from the cloud accounting services it plugs into, which include Xero, SageOne, and FreeAgent.
“The rise of cloud accounting within the SME market over the past few years has enabled us to access real-time accounting information, which we combine with other external sources of data to generate a proprietary risk score for lending to small businesses,” says Haydock.
This then enables the startup to generate a risk score that combined with DueCourse’s “data-driven decision engine” tells businesses (a) whether they are eligible to take advances against invoices and (b) the cost to access the money tied up in unpaid invoices.
He also says that DueCourse differs from the traditional invoice finance model that requires an SME to handover all invoices, sign a lengthy contract, “and involves the finance company informing all customers that the SME is in a finance arrangement”. In contrast, DueCourse is confidential (end customers are never aware a business is using the service).
“Businesses can choose how often they use it, and when they use it, whether that’s hiring new people, funding new resources or purchasing equipment,” adds Haydock.
Meanwhile, I’m told that the company plans to raise a Series A round of £10-15 million in the next 10 months to expand its service globally.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-18-at-13-50-41.png?w=738,duecourse,"DueCourse, a cloud-based invoice financing service for SMEs, raises £6.25M"
405,Mike Butcher,"According to one estimate, there are roughly 900 tech companies working in the AI field, covering everything from business intelligence to finance and security. The AI gold rush started in 2014 with a flurry of deals into AI companies. Last year there were some 300 deals into AI companies according to CB Insights and in the UK alone, companies like Ravelin, Signal and Gluru raised seed rounds. So AI isn’t going anywhere and Europe’s traditional strong suit in pure maths and research should help the AI revolution there.

407,Natasha Lomas,"The European Commission’s proposals to reform the region’s copyright rules, published in draft form today, have been criticized by tech companies and digital rights groups as regressive and a missed opportunity to modernize hopelessly outdated rules.
The Open Rights Group accused the EC of ignoring EU citizens responses to an earlier consultation on the reform, and trying to bring in regressive rules that will force private companies to police the Internet.
“The Commission’s proposals would fail to harmonise copyright law and create a fair system for Internet users, creators and rights holders. Instead we could see new regressive rights that compel private companies to police the Internet on behalf of rights holders,” said its executive director Jim Killock in a statement.
A big point of concern for many critics is the EC seeking to shift the responsibility for identifying copyrighted content by requiring Internet companies that host user uploaded video, such as YouTube and Facebook, to proactively check for copyrighted material, rather than waiting to receive a take down request from a rights holder, as is the case now.
In a blog post responding to the draft directive, Google’s Caroline Atkinson, VP of global policy, warned this shift would place big burdens on Internet companies. Although the company does also find “things to like” in the proposal (not least the EC taking note of its content-management tech, YouTube Content ID).
“Today’s proposal suggests that works including text, video, images and more must be filtered by online services. This would effectively turn the internet into a place where everything uploaded to the web must be cleared by lawyers before it can find an audience,” warned Atkinson.
The draft directive also includes a proposal for a new right for news publishers covering digital use of their content for 20 years. Unsurprisingly, Google is not a fan of this.
“We’re also disappointed to see a proposal for a new right for press publishers, despite tens of thousands of voices — including ours — calling for a different approach,” wrote Atkinson.
This extended right is similar to ancillary copyright laws already enacted by governments in Germany and Spain which target search engines displaying snippets of news stories.
The law as enacted in Spain included a mandatory fee for displaying publisher snippers and led to Google to pull its Google News service in the country. While many Germany publishers waived their rights in favor of retaining the traffic Google sends their way.
Pirate party MEP Julia Reda dubbed the proposed new news publishers right an “attack on the link”, warning it would not work.
Also criticizing this part of the proposal, Mozilla’s Denelle Dixon-Thayer suggested it could negatively impact startups by limiting the free flow of information online.
“This establishment of a new exclusive right would limit the free flow of knowledge, cripple competition, and hinder start-ups and small- and medium-sized businesses,” she wrote.
“It could, for example, require bloggers linking out to other sites to pay new and unnecessary fees for the right to direct additional traffic to existing sites, even though having the snippet would benefit both sides.”
The Open Rights Group also hit out at the EC’s failure to introduce an EU-wide freedom of panorama exception to harmonize the region’s rules and allow members of the public to share pictures they’ve taken of public buildings and art.
“While this right exists in the UK, many European countries do not have this exception, which means that innocuous holiday snaps can infringe copyright,” noted Killock.
Despite failing to create regional harmony by ignoring calls to create a panorama exception, the Commission is proposing a new copyright exception for educational establishments to use materials to illustrate teaching “through digital tools and in online courses across borders”.
Another new mandatory EU exception would also allow cultural heritage institutions to preserve works digitally. And there’s a new right for text and data-mining of copyrighted material — but only for research purposes (not for commercial use cases).
The copyright reform proposals — which the EC details at greater length here — will be submitted to the European Parliament for debate, where they are likely to face stiff opposition from the likes of Reda.
Any directive would also need to be adopted by the Council before becoming law so there’s a long road ahead for the copyright reform process — so expect the lobbying and campaigning to step up on all sides. The EC did recently U-turn on an aspect of a separate data roaming proposal, after those plans received some bad press, so there’s a chance the copyright reforms could similarly shift, depending on the reception.
“Our proposal will ensure that more content will be available, transforming Europe’s copyright rules in light of a new digital reality,” said the EC’s VP for the Digital Single Market, Andrus Ansip, in a statement today announcing the draft plans.
“We are proposing a copyright environment that is stimulating, fair and rewards investment,” added Günther Oettinger, Commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society.
Last week Europe’s top court issued a ruling on another copyright matter, related to hyperlinking. That judgement suggests European courts could interpret the sharing of a hyperlink as a copyright breach in itself — if the person is sharing a link to illegally hosted copyrighted content for a for-profit purpose or if they know the content they are linking to is copyrighted.",2016-09-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/4592786358_947e161e05_b.jpg?w=738,"ec,europe,copyright",EU digital copyright reform proposals slammed as regressive
408,"Steve O'Hear,Ingrid Lunden","We suspected it was happening and now Amazon has confirmed it. The Amazon Echo and smaller Echo Dot are coming to the U.K. and Germany, Amazon’s first releases outside of the U.S. for its voice-controlled speaker and smart home hub.
In in the case of Germany, this is Amazon’s first release in a non-English language for its Alexa voice-controlled assistant.
“Millions of customers in the US have already fallen in love with Alexa and we are thrilled that it now speaks German,” said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, in a statement. “We are pleased to bring Echo and Alexa to Germany.”
Amazon Echo is available for pre-order in the UK starting today for £149.99. It will start shipping in the coming weeks, says Amazon. For a couple of days, Prime members in the UK can pick up an Echo for £50 less. The Echo Dot will be available starting next month priced at £49.99. Or for the very enthusiastic, Amazon also will offer a 6-pack, where you buy 5 Echo Dots and get 1 free, or a 12-pack, which gets you 2 free.
In Germany, the Echo will retail for €179.99, and €60 for the Dot.
The e-commerce giant’s latest hardware play has been a surprise hit for the company since first launching at the end of 2014 in the U.S., with people in these markets asking for it right after it launched. Its popularity is part of a larger wave of devices and services launched by large tech companies over the last several years, which include other players like Apple’s Siri on OS devices; Google’s Home and Now efforts; and Microsoft’s Cortana.
Powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning, these aim to help us interact with and use other services much in the way that human assistants could do. While Amazon’s has a clear connection to its own larger e-commerce operation — you can order Amazon products through them, of course — it’s a much larger play by the company to be a platform for helping you run your whole life.
And now Amazon is ramping up scale and investment in expanding the operation. It bullishly projects it will sell 3 million units of the device in 2016, with that ramping up to 10 million in 2017, according to a report in The Information.
“Millions of customers love Alexa, and we’re thrilled to introduce her to the UK and Germany,” said Dave Limp, Senior Vice President, Amazon Devices and Services, in a statement. “We’re also excited to expand the Alexa Skills Kit and the Alexa Voice Service, so developers and hardware makers around the world can create Alexa experiences for UK and German customers.”
The UK and German versions will give you the same range of integration options — you can use it to integrate with thousands of other services by way of “skills” that you teach Alexa, Amazon’s voice-powered assistant.
There are now 3,000 of these in the U.S., Amazon announced yesterday, including entertainment/media services like Spotify and CNN (where you speak to the devices to play music or hear news); connected home services like your smart lights; as well as more basic things like using the device like a time keeper and alarm.
The big differences in the newest launches will be localisation. The U.K. version of Alexa has a British accent and will integrate additionally with some products that are available specifically in the U.K. market like the Hive thermostat, Netatmo, and the food delivery service Just-Eat. Meanwhile, the German version will include integrations that will let you order rides through MyTaxi or make calls and deal with your bills (fun!) with Deutsche Telekom. Perhaps because of the localisation issue, for now, Amazon is touting only “hundreds” of Alexa apps in Europe.
Echo and Echo Dot are being sold online but also have retail partnerships. In the U.K. these will include sales at Argos, Currys, John Lewis, PC World, and Tesco, strong partners also for Amazon’s older hardware sales in areas like its tablets and the Kindle readers.",2016-09-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/alexa-family-shot.jpg?w=738,"amazon-echo-dot,amazon-echo",Amazon’s Alexa-powered Echo and Echo Dot arrive in the UK and Germany
409,Steve O'Hear,"Just Eat, the online take-out ordering behemoth, has announced a brand refresh today with a new fancy logo and strap-line: “Find your flavour”. The latter is in reference to the publicly-listed company’s new mission to create the “world’s greatest food community”. Their words, not mine.
However, PR puffery aside, Just Eat is also announcing a number of tech updates. These include a new Apple Watch app for Apple’s WatchOS 3, a Facebook Messenger bot, and a new mobile app for delivery drivers to help partner restaurants keep customers updated on the status and whereabouts of their order.

The move will undoubtedly be seen — and I mean seen! — as the latest move in the battle for restaurant food delivery mindshare currently playing out in the UK capital city. This is seeing the likes of Uber’s Uber Eats, Amazon, Deliveroo, and Just Eat vie for visibility.
Interestingly, however, TechCrunch has learned that Just Eat has turned to London startup ScootFleet to power its new bikes. The six-month-old company, founded by Sam Merullo and Isobel Hume, offers a patented delivery scooter that boasts an illuminated “backbox” showcasing partner brands.

It then either hires these out to self-employed drivers working in the on-demand delivery sector or to delivery companies themselves who want to take advantage of this additional day and nighttime branding opportunity.
According to ScootFleet’s website, it will also supply vetted delivery drivers, including the required insurance. That feels a little like what Delivery Hero’s Valk Fleet tried to do, and we all know how that ended.
I’ve also learned that ScootFleet has partnered with a major city car park provider to store its brand-ready illuminated scooters in central parts of London, making it easier for them to be hired out on an ad hoc basis. It’s also a way for said unnamed car park company to monetize some of its spare capacity.

410,Romain Dillet,"French startup Sqreen protects your web apps and services with little effort from your side. If you don’t want to deal with security yourself, Sqreen is a software-as-a-service product that automatically watches for attacks and protects your server in real time. The company is participating in the Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt SF.
If you already have a web app up and running, chances are you’re going to face SQL injections, XSS attacks, brute-force attacks on the admin login page and more sophisticated stuff. If you don’t have the resources to hire a security person or feel like you’re not competent enough, Sqreen can help you deal with these security holes.
Integrating Sqreen on your site only takes a few minutes. You just need to execute a few commands on your server to install the Sqreen package and add a couple of lines to require the Sqreen module in your application. Sqreen doesn’t redirect your traffic or modify your code, so it should be pretty transparent for your user and code base.
After that, Sqreen monitors attacks in real time. It doesn’t act as a firewall, it watches what’s happening in your application directly. It only requires an overhead of around 4 percent when it comes to server resources. The service costs between $49 and $99 per production host per month.
Common attacks are then blocked and Sqreen suggests modifications to your code base to prevent further attacks. Sqreen works with Ruby on Rails applications. Starting today, it also works with NodeJS and Python applications.
And because of the software-as-a-service approach, Sqreen is getting smarter over time by implementing rules that benefit all of Sqreen’s customers. In order to do that, the company is gathering as much data as possible from its customers. For instance, Sqreen uses memory dumps to find out about new attacks and improve its product. Eventually, the company hopes that it’s going to make Sqreen’s shield much smarter and will make it stand out from the competition.
In addition to adding new rules, the dashboard has been completely redesigned recently and Sqreen has been adding new security features. For instance, if a user tries to attack a service and Sqreen finds out about it, this user will get flagged for other services that also use Sqreen. It’s a good example of Sqreen’s killer feature — the bigger it gets, the more powerful it becomes as it can build a community of Sqreen-protected clients that share the same shield with the same security rules.
Before Sqreen, the two co-founders worked together at Apple on the security team. They would attack Apple’s own services and then report successful attacks to the development teams. According to them, this approach was quite frustrating — it would take quite a bit of time to find a security hole, report it and fix it.
Sqreen’s shielding approach makes this process much faster, as Sqreen protects a customer before the customer has even fixed its code base. Big tech companies probably still need an in-house security team, but it makes security more accessible.
Question: What kind of performance hit do you get?
Answer: It’s about 5 percent. It’s less than performance monitoring tools [New Relic]
Q: How do you know it works?
A: We don’t protect against attacks that are way too specific to your application.
Q: How do you find new attacks?
A: Each time an attack is reported, we send it to the back end. We have a feedback loop between the events and the protection.
Q: Did your customers switch from another service?
A: There are security scanners, people who are trying to mitigate the stress, but you have nothing in between. They want to be aware of what’s happening and they want prediction.
Q: How do you plan to sell it?
A: It’s a SaaS solution. Developers can install it very quickly. We don’t need a sophisticated sales pitch, that’s one advantage of our solution.
Q: Given your background with 10 years at Apple, why did you decide to do Sqreen now?
A: We could feel this need. When you report security issues, we saw a really big gap between developers and security.
Q: How big is your team?
A: 15 people and we’re based in Paris.",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/sqreen7.jpg?w=738,"startup-battlefield,france-newsletter,battlefield,sqreen",Sqreen’s security shield automagically blocks attacks on your web app
411,Haje Jan Kamps,"It’s pretty difficult to make digital marketing sexy, but crystal (yes, with a lower-case c, which is going to drive journalists and copy-editors bananas for the foreseeable future) is going at it with both barrels.
Launched in public beta today at TechCrunch Disrupt’s Startup Alley, the product features beautiful dashboards, smart AI and Siri-like voice control. Its self-learning algorithms can learn when a company’s audiences are most likely to respond to marketing messaging and much more.
“We like to call it an advisor rather than a virtual assistant,” says Marco Cartasegna, one of the company’s founders. “We developed our own artificial intelligence engine that learns from the way your audience reacts and interacts with your content. It gives you advice and can help build efficient campaigns.”
I tested out the crystal’s voice solution and was bowled over by how smart it was. A quick “Show me what time to post to Instagram for maximum user engagement” resulted in instant recommendations and insights. Best of all, the company’s AI is not just learning from your own interactions; if it finds learnings that apply to a broader selection of its users, the insights gained from other companies on the platform make your recommendations smarter, too.

Based in Milan, Italy, the company is the brainchild of the iGenius digital agency, developing the solution to scratch its own itch.
“We have used quite a few social and web analytics tools for our own and our clients’ marketing,” says Sharka. He told me the company found many of the tools out there were too embarrassing for words, so iGenius decided to deploy 25 of its staff members to build crystal.
There’s no shortage of digital marketing SaaS services. It is undeniably a bold move to launch crystal into an intensely contested market with a number of well-entrenched players. Nonetheless, the company has huge ambitions for its future, aiming to be a comprehensive business intelligence platform, implementing data analytics, social publishing and even smart paid-for promotion of social media posts using the various platforms’ advertising APIs.

412,Steve O'Hear,"Ontame.io, a relatively new startup from the former CTO and CEO of Graduateland (which recently acquired Tyba), is building a product to bring better analytics to recruitment.
The idea is to be able to track not just where applicant and referral traffic comes from, but how this correlates to the quality of an applicant and whether or not it leads to an eventual hire.
“We created Ontame.io, with the goal of being Google Analytics for recruiters – allowing recruiters to measure all their traffic channels from first interaction to ultimate hire of a candidate,” explains Jens Reimer Olesen, co-founder and CEO of Ontame.io.
This, I’m told, enables recruiters to evaluate traffic channels based on meaningful recruitment metrics, instead of vanity metrics such as number of clicks or applications (which, says Olesen, are the only metrics traffic channels can provide).
“We do this by merging web data from the employer’s own website with funnel data from their ATS [Applicant Tracking System] and serving this in a SaaS analytics platform,” he says, adding that Ontame.io now tracks more than 100 million events on a monthly basis.
In other words, the integration with an ATS to see the outcome actually produced by online applicant traffic is something that beats the likes of Google Analytics when measuring the ROI for a recruitment campaign.
“Google Analytics allows you to measure top of funnel traffic i.e. from visit to application. But since you cannot merge it with your ATS data, you are not able to see what happens to the candidate after the application has been filed (are they hired, rejected, put on hold etc.), so basically you have no clue where the 10 new people you just hired came from”.
Meanwhile, the 2015-founded Danish startup, which has been flying relatively under the radar but already counts BMW, PwC, and Nordea (one of the biggest banks in Scandinavia) as customers, is disclosing that it’s raised $1 million in seed funding.
Backers include SEED Capital Denmark, Lars Ingerslev (former MD of LinkedIn Nordics) and Magnus Kjøller (a prominent Danish business angel).",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/ontame.jpg?w=738,,Ontame.io wants to be ‘Google Analytics’ for recruiters
413,Jon Russell,"JD.com, Alibaba’s closest rival in China, is targeting profitability after reported its Q2 2016 earnings which, while on target with expectations, saw its revenue growth continue to flatten.
JD.com, a Fortune 500 company since June, is posting rising revenues, but the rate of growth is slowing in line with reports that Chinese consumers, while growing in number as more people come online, are spending less as the economy slows. That’s impacting companies across the board and placing emphasis on overseas growth, with JD.com courting international brands with the promise of reaching China via its platform.
The company announced net revenue of RMB 65.2 billion (US$9.8 billion) for the three-month period, up for 42 percent year-on-year.
That’s down from 47.3 percent annual growth in the previous quarter, and JD.com is forecasting that the next quarter will continue to see slowing growth. Its revenue estimate of RMB 59 billion to RMB 61 billion would be between 34-38 percent year-on-year growth.

JD Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts
JD.com, which claims over 100,000 merchants and a 79 percent order rate from mobile, said it is making a push to become profitable. It posted a net loss of RMB132.1 million (US$19.9 million) for Q2 2016, a major improvement on the RMB 510.4 million loss one year previous and the RMB909.8 million loss in the previous quarter.
Also in its favor, it compared Q2 2016’s non-GAAP net income of RMB361.5 million (US$54.4 million) to the non-GAAP RMB246.7 million loss from one year previous. Its free cash flow hit a record of RMB 8.1 billion for the quarter and RMB 11.0 billion for the previous year of operations, and its JD.com Mall marketplace increased its operating margins nearly three-fold.
But the apparent slowdown also impacted other areas of business.
GMV — the total amount of sales on its platform; an important metric for e-commerce — grew 47 percent to reach RMB160.4 billion (US$24.1 billion) in Q2 2016. That’s up from RMB129.3 billion in the previous quarter, but again the growth is slowing. GMV in Q1 2016 was up 55 percent annually.
The total number of customers reached 188 million, up 65 percent annually. JD.com clocked 169.1 million customers, up 73 percent, in March for Q1 2016.
“We are pleased to record another strong quarter of healthy growth, with improving operating performance driving customer satisfaction,” said Richard Liu, JD.com CEO, in a statement.
Nasdaq-listed JD.com struck a deal to buy Walmart’s Chinese e-commerce business — Yihaodian — in June, a move that may have paved the way for the U.S. retail giant to purchase Jet.com to focus on home soil. That deal boosts JD.com’s grocery and delivery business, and that one was development highlighted in the earnings report.
“With our reputation for high-quality online shopping and same-day delivery already cemented with Chinese consumers, we are taking steps to further extend that advantage through efforts like our new strategic alliance with Walmart and Chinese online supermarket Yihaodian,” Liu added.",2016-08-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_9753.jpg?w=738,"china,e-commerce,jd-com","JD.com, Alibaba’s fierce rival, targets profitability as revenue growth flattens"
414,Jon Russell,"There was once a time when Uber’s big advantage over the competition was being integrated into Google Maps. That’s long passed now. Earlier this year, Google added a slew of non-Uber options to Maps — and that now includes Grab and Go-Jek in Southeast Asia.
Customers across Grab’s six countries in Southeast Asia can now book a licensed taxi, motorbike taxi or private car straight from the Maps app. The same applies for Go-Jek’s motorbike taxi service in Indonesia.
As with the Uber integration, the options kick in when a user has asked for directions to a place inside apps. Thereafter, the app will show the distance, location of the nearest vehicle and a price estimate. Clicking the ride option will then redirect to the Grab or Go-Jek app.

“Google Maps has been helping people navigate the world for over a decade, and we’re excited to be able to make Southeast Asia more accessible through Grab’s affordable, on-demand local transport options,” Grab said in a blog post.
These new integrations come at an interesting time for Southeast Asia’s ride-sharing space.
Uber has upped its focus on Southeast Asia lately, and it looks set to put more resources into the region following the sale of its Uber China business unit.
Grab is raising a new round of funding at a valuation of $2.3 billion, sources told TechCrunch. Bloomberg reported that China’s Didi Chuxing and SoftBank will lead an investment of around $600 million into the company.
While Go-Jek, which is lesser known globally but leading the motorbike on-demand space in Indonesia, last week closed $550 million in new funding at a post-money valuation that TechCrunch understands to be $1.3 billion. The company also hinted that it may expand in Southeast Asia for the first time — this Google Maps integration may help that effort.
The Google Maps app still prioritizes Uber over the other options, but the end of the monopoly has much in common with Google’s relationship with Uber, which is complicated to say the least.
The search giant invested in Uber back in 2013 via Google Ventures — which was its largest deal — but these days its alliance is a finely balanced one. Google practically pioneered self-driving cars, but Uber is developing its own. Uber has been dependent on Google Maps to date, but the company is reportedly spending $500 million to develop its own solution. It previously bought a small U.S.-based map tech startup and a slice of Microsoft Bing’s maps business.
It isn’t just that Uber is stepping on Google’s toes. There have been many reports that Google is working on an Uber rival of its own, and Waze — the automative map service it acquired in 2013 — does actually offer a carpooling service.",2016-08-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/grab_logo.jpg?w=738,"southeast-asia,go-jek,grab",Google Maps adds rides with Uber rivals Grab and Go-Jek in Southeast Asia
415,Jon Russell,"Look! Another notable funding round for a fintech startup in Southeast Asia, after Singapore-based Funding Societies raised a $7.5 million Series A round for its take on marketplace lending.
Sequoia India — the VC firm’s fund that invests in Southeast Asian companies — led the investment, which included angel investors.
Launched in June 2015, Funding Societies is similar to established U.S. companies like Lending Club, which allow anyone to provide money for a loan with the potential to get it back alongside interest. The Singaporean company differentiates itself slightly by calling itself a “peer-to-business” platform. That essentially means that it currently only provides loans for SMEs, rather than consumers, although that could change in the future when it has higher volumes.
Fund Societies is active in Singapore and (as ‘Modalku’) Indonesia — Southeast Asia’s most developed economy and its largest economy, respectively — where it is rivaled by the likes of Capital Match and MoolahSense.
The company said it has paid out $8.7 million to date across 96 loans. It claims a 94 percent repayment rate which CEO Kelvin Teo touted as its most notable data point since it shows reliability over volume.
“We’re not the biggest in Singapore, but we have done the most term loans because we take the approach that over-lending to a person will come and bite you in terms of defaults,” he explained.
As for fine details: Funding Societies is primarily focused on working capital loans. In Singapore, the average loan size is SG$90,000 ($67,000) while that falls to SG$25,000 ($18,500) in Indonesia.
It charges a loan origination feed to the borrower (3-4 percent in Singapore, 5-6 percent in Indonesia) and a 1 percent monthly fee to the lender. It claims an approval rate of between 15-25 percent for loan applicants.
Teo told TechCrunch that the company is working to expand its service to Malaysia, where it has a handful of employees and an application to operate locally is pending regulator feedback.
Those two areas — expansion to Malaysia and regulation generally — are among the key focuses for the money it just raised. Teo explained that the industry is still so young in the region, and it has bulked up on finances in anticipation of the demands of new regulations that is incoming.
He highlighted the importance of compliance by stressing that that even just raising money from investors required “an unbelievable” number of law firms.
“Industry regulation has been announced in Singapore, but it will still take some investment to reach that level of compliance,” he said.
Likewise, in Indonesia, he said the company is working with regulators to introduce a framework to regulate peer-based lending.
Teo foresaw plenty of competition coming to market — that is why he and co-founder Reynold Wijaya launched the company in 100 days last year while they were in the U.S. completing their studies at Harvard University.
“If we had waited until we graduated [this year,] we’d have been too late to the market,” he said.
Not only was being early important to grasp the early opportunity, Teo argued, but timing was critical since he believes that the financial implication of regulations will put many competitors without funding out of business.
“If they haven’t fundraised in this period, platforms in this region will face difficulties to be compliant in their operations,” he said. “We expect the market to overheat in the next six months and then [there to be] consolidation.”
Outside of compliance and expansion — which includes expanding beyond capital city Jakarta in Indonesia — Funding Societies is planning to invest in its product. Right now, it has an iOS app for lenders and an Android app for businesses seeking loans — it is hard to ignore that Apple’s devices generally capture the more affluent portion of society in Asia, hence this decision — but Teo said there are plans to streamline its services for borrowers and lenders, add more services “make investment options that are tailored to investor needs.”
That sounds like a lot, and the company has already grown to some 70 employees, but the Funding Societies CEO insists that the company is matching startup-style growth with the responsibility that comes with providing financial products.
“We and our investors take the view in building slow and steady, instead of pushing hyper-growth, [which is] when default rates come and hit you.
“To be profitable, you need to achieve scale and that takes time,” he added, explaining that the company has a “two-to-three-year” target to reach breakeven.",2016-08-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/screenshot-2016-08-08-18-58-54.png?w=738,"singapore,funding-societies",Funding Societies raises $7.5M for its loan marketplace in Southeast Asia
416,Jon Russell,"AngelList, the online platform for venture capital, is making a huge impact in the early-stage funding scene in the U.S. — it helped raise over $160 million for startups last year, for one thing — and now it is looking to expand its horizons to India.
The U.S. firm is working to launch its syndicates product — which lets investors team up and pool funds for investments. It’s continuing to run its hiring service in the South Asian country. And now AngelList it has brought on Utsav Somani (an angel investor himself) to lead the India effort. [Correction: The hiring service is not new. It was already running in India.]
India’s investor community is scaling back on later-stage deals after watching some capital-intensive projects run into problems, but the seed end of the market remains healthy. In total, startups in the country raised $2.1 billion in the first six months of this year, according to data from YourStory.
Somani told us he will be based in New Delhi but regularly traveling across India. He explained that beyond helping connect India’s startup community more tightly, the idea is to enable AngelList’s community of investors in the U.S. and elsewhere to tap into India for hiring or investment purposes.
We understand that the rough timeline for these launches is within the next twelve months. The biggest challenge standing in the way appears to be regulations. AngelList is working to gain the approval of India’s Security and Exchange Board (SEBI), Somani explained in a blog post.
“My role will consist of opening dialogue with government officials and regulators with suggestions that’ll benefit startups and investors in India. I’ll map out the Indian regulatory framework so AngelList can come in with [its] pop-up VC structure that enables venture investing online at scale,” he wrote.
Somani believes that AngelList’s objectives fit squarely with the ‘Startup India’ initiative established by Indian Prime Minister Modi earlier this year, which is designed to increase innovation and jobs inside the country. Not to mention, he told TechCrunch, that “almost everyone in India knows about AngelList, hires through it, or at least has a presence there.” (The service currently counts 656 accredited investors based in India, and a further 5,951 who are “interested in India.”)
Syndicates have been launched in Europe, initially via the U.K., and Australia so a foray into India would deepen its global network and give investors and startups alike increased funding opportunities.
That’s not all that AngelList is doing overseas, however. Outside of the U.S., AngelList is powering a $400 million seed fund from China called CSC Upshot — which also apparently earned the distinction as the world’s largest seed fund — while there are numerous smaller investment funds in the U.S. using the platform, such as Maiden Lane.
All told, AngelList counts 170 active syndicates on its platform. On the recruiter/talent hiring side, it claims to have 16,000 companies seeking hires with 40,000 new candidates added each month. So far, AngelList said it has enabled more than 10,000 hires.",2016-08-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/india-flag.jpg?w=738,"crowdinvesting,india,angellist",AngelList is launching ‘Syndicates’ in India
417,Jon Russell,"The wait is over for many Pokémon Go fans in Asia, after the smash hit game went live in 15 new countries in the continent.
The full list of new countries are: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau.
A major expansion in Asia has been expected for some time, but three obvious countries not on the list are India, Korea and China.
In the case of India, where smartphone sales are growing in double-digital percent among its 1.2 billion population, it isn’t clear what is holding the launch up and when the game will go live.
For China, a huge gaming market for mobile, regulations and the game’s reliance on Google Maps are the challenges obstructing a launch, as Niantic CEO John Hanke told Forbes. Hanke also said that security issues with Google Maps in Korea — another lucrative spot for mobile games — have held up the launch, although it is unofficially available in some parts of the country.
Pokémon Go was initially launched in the U.S. on July 6, before subsequently rolling out to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Europe later. Japan, the home of Pokémon, became its first launch country on July 21 — having been delayed after word of the launch leaked out — and the game made it to Hong Kong four days later. It has also launched in Brazil, where the Olympics are currently being held, and there are more plans for Latin America.
The game recently passed 100 million downloads and, in the U.S., its rise is being credited with doubling sales of portable smartphone battery backups. It hasn’t all been plain sailing: the game lags for many users during peak times, it looks like its lucrative revenue growth has slowed, and Niantic upset many gamers recently when it blocked third-party tracking apps.",2016-08-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/gettyimages-546978934.jpg?w=738,"nintendo,pokemon-company,niantic,pok%c3%a9mon-go","Pokémon Go is now live in 15 more countries in Asia, but not India or China"
418,Jon Russell,"Indonesia-based Go-Jek, the motorbike taxis on-demand company that competes with Uber and Grab, has confirmed that it has raised upwards of $550 million in new funding. It also hinted that it may expand to other parts of Southeast Asia for the first time.
The company’s valuation was not disclosed, but we reported earlier than it values Go-Jek at $1.3 billion post-money.
The money was provided by new investors KKR, Warburg Pincus, Farallon Capital and Capital Group Private Markets. Existing investors Sequoia India, Northstar Group, DST Global, NSI Ventures, Rakuten Ventures and Formation Group also took part.
The money will be used to scale operations and, in particular, grow its services, which include a payment system, food delivery, courier services as well as regular passenger rides. Go-Jek claims to have 200,000 drivers in its fleet and 20 million app downloads to date. For its services business, it said it has 35,000 food delivery partners and 3,000 “service” providers.
The Jakarta-based firm said it may “potentially” use the new capital to expand its service across Southeast Asia, moving its rivalry with Grab and Uber into new countries.
“We are extremely humbled and excited to work with such world-class partners. KKR, Warburg Pincus, Farallon, Capital Group and other participants in this fundraise not only bring global experience in the TMT sector, but they are also experienced local partners,” Nadiem Makarim, CEO and co-founder of GO-JEK, said in a statement.

“It has been fantastic for NSI Ventures to support Go-Jek’s talented management team since 2014. Having this new group of global investors on board will further accelerate Go-Jek’s innovation and allow Go-Jek to solidify its position as an Indonesian tech leader,” said Shane Chesson, partner of NSI Ventures, one of Go-Jek’s earliest backers.",2016-08-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/go-jek-2.jpg?w=738,"southeast-asia,indonesia,go-jek",Uber rival Go-Jek confirms $550M raise and hints at Southeast Asia expansion
419,Jon Russell,"Grab, the company that rivals Uber in Southeast Asia, is in negotiations to close a new round of funding that could value it as high as $2.3 billion, multiple sources close to talks told TechCrunch. Grab was valued around $1.5 billion-$1.6 billion last August when it raised $350 million.
The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg this week reported that existing investors Didi Chuxing and SoftBank may lead a $600 million round of new financing. The sum could reach $1 billion after a second close.
Grab has been in discussions with potential investors to raise money for a number of months, but the round is not yet closed, sources told TechCrunch. That target valuation of $2.3 billion, however, is subject to some secondary share sales from existing backers, we understand, which, once blended, could lower the figure.
In the world of ridehailing apps and fast-funding, Singapore-based Grab — which offers licensed taxis, private cars and motorbike taxis in six countries — hasn’t raised at the frequency of others. Its last financing came in August 2015 when it closed a $350 million Series E round. That included money from Didi and sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation (CIC), among others.
Unlike Uber, which has seen numerous investors decks and financial presentations leaked over the years, precious little is known about the internals of Grab’s business.
According to documents from Grab investors dated last year — circulated for potential secondary share sales — which were viewed by TechCrunch, the company was forecasted to burn $111 million in Q3 2015 — that’s more than $35 million per month. The same data revealed that Grab had $606 million in cash on its books after it closed its Series E round.
A Grab spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company has not yet touched its Series E money.
The projections we viewed estimated that Grab would make $31 million in annual net revenue for 2015 — that’s the total amount of money it keeps from the transactions on its platform. That figure was forecast to grow to $193 million in 2016 and $526 million in 2017.
Grab has never revealed the number of trips it completes each day across Southeast Asia. The same documents forecast that the company would reach 400,000 daily trips by December, with a target of 3.5 million rides per day by the end of 2017.
Grab declined to comment on the content of the documents.
It’s notable that news is now leaking out that both Didi and SoftBank are reportedly investing in this round, considering the wider state of play in Asia at the moment with both companies.
SoftBank has pulled back on its overseas deals since Masayoshi Son decide to remain head of the company longer than planned, a move that saw his once heir apparent Nikesh Arora depart. In addition to cutting back on investments in India-based startups, SoftBank sold off a portion of its stake in Alibaba and its holdings in games firms GungHo and SuperCell. A big move to buy ARM was viewed by analysts as a shift in strategy to invest in proven companies.
For Didi, a further investment in Grab comes as doubts have been cast over its alliance with Grab, Lyft and Ola — the so-called Anti-Uber Alliance — following a deal to buy Uber China announced this week.
As part of that acquisition, Didi is investing a reported $1 billion into Uber’s global business, while Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and Didi Chairman Cheng Wei will join each other’s boards. That deal appears to conflict with the alliance, since their opposition to Uber is the common factor that underpins their union.
Lyft — which took a $100 million investment from Didi last year — told The Wall Street Journal this week it will “evaluate” its partnership with Didi “over the next few weeks.”
Grab took news of the Didi-Uber deal more positively, with CEO Anthony Tan telling staff it is proof that a local rival can beat the U.S. ridehailing giant.
“They’ve lost once, and we will make them lose again,” he wrote in a company-wide memo obtained by TechCrunch.
Tan and Grab’s competition is about to get stiffer, though. We reported last week that Uber is pushing new services aggressively in Southeast Asia, a region that has been a distant priority to its businesses in China and India, and Tan himself told staff that he expects Uber to increase its focus on Grab’s home turf.
Uber is just one of the problems when it comes to Indonesia, the country Grab recently said is its largest based on rides. Motorbike taxi on-demand startup Go-Jek, which claims a fleet of 200,000 drivers, today closed $550 million in fresh investment at $1.2 billion valuation. Internal documents show the company completed 256,000 rides per day, as of April 2016.
Grab faces its own challenges, too. Tan has spoken about the difficulty of hiring talent in Southeast Asia, and retaining hires is likewise a test. Numerous former Grab staff told TechCrunch that the company is struggling to motivate and retain its workforce, particularly those in technical positions.
Specifically, the introduction of a bell curve assessment system — a model in which companies discard their least effective staff — has had a detrimental impact on morale, we were told. While popular in Silicon Valley, that style of management hasn’t been embraced by many startups in Southeast Asia.
Other sources called Grab’s management ineffective and their policies haphazard, and claimed that the office it opened in Seattle in January is symptomatic of its struggle to attract and retain talent in Southeast Asia.
Another challenge for the company is that it started out offering rides with licensed taxis, which are significantly less lucrative than Uber’s rides, for example. For its GrabTaxi licensed taxi ride service, Grab charges only a booking fee of $1-2, with the driver keeping the fare in full. Uber takes a variable cut of each ride it facilities, typically as much as 30 percent.
Grab addressed this gap when it started a private car business — Grab Car — three years ago, which uses Uber-style pricing; however, it is somewhat cannibalized by the GrabTaxi service. According to data shared by Grab investors, the GrabTaxi service accounted for 70 percent of all Grab trips taken in July 2015. The figures will have changed since then, although the lower-profit taxi business is likely still dominant.
Grab said last month that its GrabCar and GrabBike services account for “the vast majority” of trips it processes in Indonesia. The company did not provide a raw figure to support that statement, and it said that it does not break down out its ride per day or revenue figures across the region.",2016-08-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/grab.png?w=738,"taxi,singapore,southeast-asia,grab","Uber rival Grab is raising at $2.3B valuation, reportedly burning $35M a month"
420,Jon Russell,"Xiaomi is broadening its already expansive range of products by venturing into virtual reality for the first time.
The company today announced the Mi VR Play, an “entry-level” virtual reality headset that it hopes can open this new exciting medium to new audiences because not everyone has thousands of dollars needed to set up an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Democratizing technology is the thesis behind most of Xiaomi’s competitively priced products, including the $550/$750 notebook announced last week that will rival Apple’s Macbook in China.
This new device recalls Google’s super-cheap and super-simple Cardboard VR headset. It is fairly basic in nature; you pop a smartphone into the lycra-built body then open Xiaomi’s Mi VR app, which contains VR content from selected partners that include Conde Nast Traveler and YouKu, “China’s YouTube.” Xiaomi pledged to invest $1 billion in video content, including VR, last year, so that library is sure to get bigger over time.
Here’s how Xiaomi describes the headset:
Sounds good so far?
Here’s the catch — you can’t go and buy one, even if you’re in China.
Xiaomi is making it available to a limited number of beta test users, who signed up on August 1 when Xiaomi put out a call for volunteers. One million users signed up in just eight hours, the company said, but Xiaomi has selected just a fraction of those — likely “tens of thousands,” a representative told TechCrunch.
For those lucky ones accepted into the test program, the Mi VR Play will cost just RMB 1 ($0.15).
Xiaomi told us that it has plans to make the headset more widely available in the future, but there’s no schedule for that right now. Along those lines, it isn’t clear how much the headset will cost once it is on sale to all. We suspect it won’t be RMB 1, sadly.",2016-08-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/mi-vr-play_01.png?w=738,"china,virtual-reality",Xiaomi announces its first VR headset — but you can’t buy it yet
421,Jon Russell,"Go-Jek, the on-demand motorbike taxi service that rivals Uber and Grab in Indonesia, has closed $550 million in new funding, a source close to the company told TechCrunch. The deal values Go-Jek at $1.3 billion (post-money) and could be announced as soon as this week, we understand.
Go-Jek did not respond to a request for comment or confirmation.
Update: The round has been confirmed.
The company plans to spend the money growing its services businesses, and continuing to compete with its fierce rivals in Indonesia. It doesn’t appear that this round will fund an expansion outside of Indonesia, according to our source.
The Wall Street Journal last month reported that Go-Jek was in talks to raise $400 million, with KKR and Warburg Pincus among the potential new backers. The startup’s existing investors include Sequoia Capital, DST Global and Singapore-based NSI Ventures.
The deal makes Go-Jek one of the few unicorns in Southeast Asia. Others tech companies valued in excess of $1 billion include games firm Garena ($3.75 billion), Go-Jek rival Grab (estimated $1.5 billion-$1.6 billion) and Amazon-like shopping site Lazada ($1.5 billion valuation).
Go-Jek was founded in 2010, but it didn’t begin to take off in a major way until 2014, as this profile explains. It then grew faster after it introduced a mobile booking app in early 2015.
Go-Jek claims 200,000 motorbike drivers — known as “ojeks” in Indonesia — in its fleet across Indonesia, which is the world’s fourth largest country with a population of more than 250 million people.
The company is best known for hailing motorbike taxis on demand, a type of transportation popular in parts of Southeast Asia where heavy urban traffic makes two wheels faster than four. Demand is particularly high in Jakarta, which is home to some 30 million people and is one of the planet’s most congested cities. In addition to regular rides, Go-Jek offers on-demand services like food, shopping and package deliveries.
The company said recently that it processed 20 million booking requests in June 2016, or around 667,000 per day. Internal documents seen by TechCrunch show it fulfilled 256,000 rides per day, as of April 2016.
Grab introduced a similar service, GrabBike, to Indonesia last year, and Uber’s UberMoto competitor showed up in the country this year — but Go-Jek is widely acknowledged to be leading the pack in Indonesia.
This new fund raising comes at an interesting time for Southeast Asia’s on-demand services. Uber’s decision to sell its China operations to Didi Chuxing is likely to mean that the U.S. company — valued at $66 billion — will divert more resources into Southeast Asia and India, potentially increasing the competition with Grab in its six markets and Go-Jek in Indonesia. Uber has already started launching new services across Southeast Asia and reached operational profitability in two countries.
Grab meanwhile welcomes Didi’s deal with Uber as evidence that the U.S. ridehailing giant can be defeated by local rivals. The Didi-Uber deal seemed to throw Grab’s alliance with Didi, which invested in the Singapore-based company last year, into jeopardy, but Didi is reportedly leading a new round of investment in Grab, according to both Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal. That round could reportedly rise to $1 billion, while Grab has said that it is still yet to touch the $350 million Series E round that it raised one year ago.
Internal documents viewed by TechCrunch show that Go-Jek had $104 million in cash on its books as of March and that it spent $73 million over the previous six-month period. Given the increased competition it is likely to face, this new raise is hugely important if it is to continue to compete with its cash-rich rivals on subsidies and marketing.

422,Ingrid Lunden,"As interest and investment continue to pour into the online education market, startups building platforms with a lot of traction are reaping the rewards. In the latest development, a company out of China called VIPKID — which has built a popular platform connecting children aged between five and 12 years with native English speakers for one-to-one online language lessons — has raised $100 million in funding.
You may not have heard much about VIPKID in the West. That may be because, for now, its target market is China, where VIPKID is filling a hole: upwardly mobile parents want their kids to learn English with native speakers, and there just aren’t enough English teachers of that kind to go around in the country.
“The rapid spread of broadband in China has made it possible to bring one-to-one English and broader curriculum learning directly to families throughout the country at an affordable price level,” said Cindy Mi, founder and CEO of VIPKID, in a statement.
VIPKID says that it has been growing at 10x year-over-year, and it now has half a million registered students in China and some 3,000 instructors on its platform. Instructors are based mainly in the U.S., but also Canada, Mexico, UK, Germany, Italy, Spain, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and East and Southeast Asia.
VIPKID says its instructors are typically teachers and other professionals who are putting in hours at VIPKID as a way of earning a little extra money (which makes VIPKID an interesting twist on the collaborative consumption model where people earn extra money by signing on as cleaners or drivers for other kinds of on-demand startups).
The Series C round comes from a list of notable investors that includes Yunfeng Capital (the firm co-founded by Alibaba CEO and founder Jack Ma), previous investor Sequoia, and, it seems, at least one other Silicon Valley VC close to the education space that is not yet being disclosed.
This latest round brings the total raised by VIPKID since 2013 to $125 million, with previous investors also including Innovation Works, Matrix Partners, and Northern Light Venture Capital. (VIPKID is not disclosing its valuation in this round, but we are trying to find out. As one point of comparison, Age of Learning, an e-learning startup app-based out of California, raised $150 million at a $1 billion valuation earlier this year.)
VIPKID said it will be using the funding to grow its business, acquiring more users in the 5-12 year-old age group in China wanting to learn English, and finding more people abroad who would like to teach them. VIPKID says it’s currently adding 1,000 new instructors each month.
VIPKID appears to be growing fast despite the fact that there is a lot of competition.
Today, there are dozens of startups that use technology to help people learn languages outside of traditional, physical classrooms. In addition to legacy software from companies like Rosetta Stone, there is a new generation of mobile apps like includes the likes of Monkimun; software that taps machine learning and AI to provide an interactive, customized learning experience; and even early attempts at chat bots to pick up languages.
VIPKID — as with its most direct local competitors, ABC360 and VIPABC (which, in a bit of a twist, counts Alibaba as an investor) — is tapping into tech, too, but it also keeps actual humans at the core of the experience.
The company eschews services like Skype and instead has built its own videoconferencing platform that it uses for one-to-one sessions (no group learning) between students and teachers. And it has crafted its own language learning curriculum, based on U.S. Common Core State Standards and a “flipped-classroom approach,” (that is, homework includes lectures that you watch, and class time is used for more interactive activities). It also integrates other innovations such as gamification.
And while VIPKID is now starting to introduce mobile apps, it has built its business primarily around desktop browsers and broadband.
Although a number of e-learning services attract users with a freemium or low-cost model, VIPKID takes a different approach here, too. It offers a single free trial lesson, but for anything more, it charges by 30-minute sessions, at a fee of 288 yuan ($43) a pop. Teachers — who must pass a set of relatively stringent requirements to qualify — in turn are paid between $7 and $11 per half-hour session, depending on experience, attendance and finishing classes.
Over time, it sounds like the plan is to enhance the learning platform and expand to more subjects and geographies, but for now, there is still growth to be found in VIPKID’s current target audience.",2016-08-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/screen-shot-2016-08-03-at-13-52-56.png?w=738,"china,language-learning,e-learning,online-learning",VIPKID nabs $100M to link Chinese kids with native speakers to learn English
423,Christiaan Kaptein,"

From the offices of Venture Capital firms to the financial services districts, you may not be able to escape the promising whispers of fintech startups. Take a structural shift to mobile, an ever decreasing cost of computing power, the availability of lots of (big!) data, mix in one part artificial intelligence, one part distributed ledgers and we have the perfect recipe for how technology will change the face of banking and insurance forever.
Jokes aside, in certain areas, the unbundling of financial services is truly underway. Regulatory change, a deep customer mistrust, and a seriously out of tune with reality technology stack and physical infrastructure all contribute to the opportunity to build exciting new companies in Financial Services.
As a result, venture capital funding for fintech has rapidly expanded. According to KPMG and CB Insights, a total of $5.7 billion was invested in fintech in the first quarter of 2016 alone. While companies in China and the U.S. receive most of this funding, Southeast Asia fintech investment has increased significantly as well.
Singapore, with its Smart Nation initiative, rightly believes investment in technology is a necessary condition to thrive. It has announced a Smart Financial Centre, which includes the $225 million Financial Sector Technology and Innovation (“FSTI”) scheme and a regulatory sandbox environment to enable market entry for startups. Malaysia in 2015 was the first ASEAN country to issue a regulatory framework for equity crowdfunding, followed by marketplace lending, and Indonesia is issuing new credit bureau licences to improve centralized credit data collection and availability.
Indeed it looks like fintech in Southeast Asia is thriving. In the last 18 months, Southeast Asian fintech startups took a combined $345 million of funding.
So, all is good, end of story? Let’s take a look at the data and examine the state of VC-backed fintech investment in Singapore and Southeast Asia.
Part I: Fintech funding as a percentage of total Venture Capital funding in the region
In 2015 and the first half of 2016, a total of $3 billion was invested in startups in Southeast Asia. As recent as 2011, total VC funding for all of Southeast Asia was less than $200 million. For analysis purposes, we take out all companies that raised in excess of $100 million, who account for $1.41 billion, almost half of all VC funding in Southeast Asia. But that is a different story, back to fintech.
Taking out these large investments in companies such as Grab, there was $1.5 billion of VC funding left. Of this, $345 million went to fintech. This is an incredible 21.6 percent of all funding excluding the outliers.
Wait, what? Did fintech really take almost a quarter of all VC funding in Southeast Asia?

A closer look at fintech funding by sub sector
We analyse all fintech VC investments in Southeast Asia in excess of $1 million in 2015 and H1 2016. Altogether, we count 59 funding rounds over $1 million for a total of $345 million. Believe it or not, that’s what we call Series A here.
Next, we allocate each round of funding to one of six categories; credit, asset & wealth, insurance, payments, lead generation, and blockchain. As shown in Figure 2, payments and lead generation account for 78 percent of all fintech VC funding in 2015 and H1 2016. The remaining $75 million was invested in credit, asset management, wealth management, insurance and blockchain companies.
What might explain this large skewness toward payments and lead generation?
Barriers to entry differ per sector. We view fintech opportunities through the lens of three core arbitrages: regulatory, information, and trust. For example, in order to take customer deposits, a fintech company needs to be regulated, private banking customers only entrust their wealth and information to those they trust, and loan underwriting requires access to information that enables underwriters to assess borrowers’ capacity and propensity to repay. This both explains the high barriers to entry in these areas, and the resulting lower funding levels.
Likewise, payment and lead generation have their own sets of barriers and require a different set of skills. As payments supports the growth of e-commerce and lead generation is an e-commerce-like service offered to financial institutions, investment in these areas tends to be dominated by venture firms with expertise in areas such as e-commerce and ad-tech. There are many more such funds, and they are typically larger in size than fintech funds, explaining the higher levels of funding.
Payments and lead generation investment activity also started a few years earlier, as far back as the early 2000’s in Southeast Asia. Larger Series B and C rounds in this space further skew the results. We expect the less invested sectors to catch up in the next 12-36 months.
Payments and lead generation: CompareAsiaGroup (lead generation) raised $40 million, which is more than was raised in credit, blockchain, and insurance combined. Ruma raised a significant round of funding build out its O2O network for payments and other over the counter services in Indonesia, and there are various companies building B2B cross-border payment solutions such as Instarem, which recently raised a $5 million Series A. Jirnexu raised $3 million to build out XpressApply, a SaaS fulfilment as a service platform for banks and insurers to manage the entire flow from lead to on-boarding. Cashshield offers a fraud protection solution for merchants.

Credit: Marketplace and other online direct lending is nascent across Singapore and Southeast Asia. All structural drivers are in place (we look at availability of alternative data, scalability and cost efficiency of underwriting process, ability to offer a better user experience, a conducive regulatory environment, and liquidity from the lender perspective). Despite this, less than 0.1 percent of all loans are originated through fintech startups. This contrasts with over 10 percent in China, and two to three percent in the U.S. and U.K..
The addressable market in Southeast Asia is over $1 trillion in loans, and there are interesting companies getting built; some choose to go into credit scoring as a service (Lenddo, TrustingSocial). Some choose to build plain vanilla marketplaces in the largest consumer markets (FundingSocieties, through Modalku), and others focus on more niche opportunities, such as Capital Match, the leading domestic factoring marketplace in Singapore (a $36 billion annual market) and Provider, which offers a solution for cross-border migrant financing. Some of the challenges in this space include a patchwork of regulations across markets, a lack of centralized or bureau credit data, a challenging collection process, and, depending on where you are, various degrees of legal recourse. These challenges mirror those in China, and we expect the market to develop along similar lines.
Asset and wealth: In most markets in Southeast Asia, innovation in asset and wealth is mainly focused on retail brokerage. Singapore is an exception, and there are a wide range of interesting companies solving big, mostly B2B, problems. FX is an obvious investment area, as Singapore is one of the largest FX hubs in the world and yet almost all FX trades still are cleared on trading venues in London and Tokyo. We are building a company to provide a solution here called Spark Systems.
There are a number of interesting marketplaces, such as SmartKarma, which changes the way market participants create, distribute, and consume investment insights. WeConvene offers a marketplace that connects buy-side, sell-side, and corporates for all things corporate access. Mesitis, through its account aggregation and visualization tool Canopy, helps private bank customers get a complete view of their wealth. 4xLabs builds software for moneychangers, as hundreds of billions of dollars a year of physical FX transactions go through moneychangers every year virtually without any technology.
Insurance: By far the sector that has attracted the least investment to date. MyDoc brings together doctors, patients, employers, and insurers through its healthcare communications platform. CXA has built an interesting wellness and flexible benefits solution on top of a traditional brokerage platform. Medipay in Indonesia provides APIs that connect medical service providers with insurers. The company facilitate insurance claims, authorization and payments. Claimdi facilitates communication between policyholders and their insurance providers.
Other areas of interest are micro-insurance and other direct to consumer insurance platforms. On the claims and underwriting side, there is little entrepreneurial activity to date that we know of.
Blockchain: In Southeast Asia, we are seeing an increasing number of startups both on the currency as well as smart contract side of blockchain. Coins.PH vertically integrates a cryptocurrency exchange with consumer banking solutions in the Philippines. Otonomos lets you form, fund and govern your company on the ethereum blockchain, offering a digital dashboard to manage your cap table, governance, and soon accounting, payments and analytics.
Clearly Southeast Asia fintech is an early stage market. Ticket sizes are typically $0.5 – $3 million, valuations tend to be reasonable and as funding really wasn’t there until recently, most entrepreneurs have grown up with a sense that cash flows and profitability are necessary conditions for survival. As one famous Chinese fintech entrepreneur told us recently over breakfast: “You can have the nicest mobile app in the world with the best UX and UI, but if you are not solving a real problem, well, you will go out of business sooner or later.” In short, without the ‘fin’, there is no ‘tech’.
For the rest of 2016 we expect increasing investment activity across all of fintech, and are especially excited about opportunities in asset & wealth, credit, insurance, and blockchain, where we continue to see more investable opportunities then there are venture funds willing to back them.
In November, there is the inaugural Singapore FinTech Festival, a five-day event that “brings together the global financial community in a week-long celebration of fintech”, hosted by the MAS. Perhaps that is a good time to take stock again of the state of fintech in Southeast Asia, to take a look at who are the backers of fintech companies in this region, and also examine why so many Chinese entrepreneurs and investors are passing through Singapore recently.

424,Jon Russell,"Many in the media and tech industry see Uber’s decision to sell its Chinese business unit to rival Didi Chuxing as a failure for the U.S. ride-hailing giant. It’s easy to believe that the sale of Uber China’s operations to its closest rival is a face-saving exercise, an inevitable outcome for a U.S. company that tried to beat the odds and succeed in China.
But the more you chew over the finer points of the deal, the more it looks like an astute piece of business for both parties.
Don’t believe that this deal was created in haste. The rumor of a merger had been circulating for a month — with both sides denying it — and one source close to negotiations told TechCrunch that the two parties had tried to engineer a deal two previous times without success. So it was third time lucky but, more importantly, ongoing discussions suggest that this is more than Uber saving face — this is an alliance.
Likewise, don’t believe that Didi acted out of kindness. Didi showed it can raise capital easily when it closed a colossal $7.3 billion funding round that even included money from Apple. It could have let Uber continue to spend billions in China and wither, but it wanted to remove its threat from China and perhaps elsewhere. This was two-way; not merely a tactical Uber exit.
So, how does the deal play out?
Firstly, and most obviously, Uber swaps its capital-intensive business unit in China that its own CEO said was costing it $1 billion per year, for a (potentially) near-20 percent stake in the country’s dominant ride-sharing company, valued at $35 billion. That’s a near-11 fold increase on Didi’s valuation when it was formed by a merger in 2015.
But there’s certain to be a lot more growth.
Earlier this summer, Li Zijian, senior director for international strategy at Didi, estimated that his company is taking just 1.1 percent of China’s taxi market. China’s new regulations, which will legalize Uber and Didi from November, combined with this merger are sure to mean that Didi’s business grows multiples more — all with Uber as its largest single shareholder.
That stake not only allows Uber to move towards a much-anticipated IPO by removing the China cash burn from its balance sheet, but it is likely to be a very lucrative holding in a business with vast potential to grow. Even if Didi has so far denied reports of IPO plans of its own.
There are some who argue that Uber could have saved time and money and simply invested in Didi earlier if it wanted this kind of financial return potential. For one thing, it would have needed to choose between Didi Kuaidi and Didi Dache, which eventually merged. But, more than that, it is foolish to believe that Didi Chuxing would have grown into the company that it is today without rivalry from Uber.
Uber, for example, pioneered peer-to-peer in China when it introduced People’s Uber in late 2014. It hadn’t been done before at scale. Didi was unprepared and late to the party, introducing its take on the service some six months later. The company started out working exclusively with licensed taxis, and this example shows that competition with Uber clearly sharpened its business and helped shape its growth.

The real negative here looks to be for Didi’s allies: Lyft in the U.S., Ola in India and Grab in Southeast Asia.
The four companies formed a coalition, dubbed the ‘Anti-Uber Alliance’, last year for business synergies such as enabling users to roam between services when they travel, and sharing know-how. Alongside that, Didi made investments in its three allies: putting $100 million in Lyft, and contributing undisclosed minority amounts to Ola’s $500 million round last year, and Grab’s most recent $350 million raise one year ago.
While it often seemed like a PR play, the coalition does give Didi’s cohorts solidarity and support, and likely increased confidence to investors, all of which is important when you are battling a global giant like Uber, which is seemingly capable of raising billions in fresh funding on a whim.
Well, that alliance looks uncertain at best, or messy at worst, following Uber’s deal with Didi.

Not only that, but Uber CEO Travis Kalanick will sit on the Didi board, no less, while Didi Chairman Cheng Wei will join the Uber board.
Many, including yours truly, saw the alliance and those Didi investments as a possible first step to acquisitions to expand Didi overseas as and when it saw fit. But this deal with Uber throws all of that into contention. Who is to say that, in Southeast Asia, for example, Didi will back Grab with any vigor now that it is also aligned with Uber. It could let the market play out and then befriend the company that wins.
That’s a hypothetical scenario, of course, but it was unthinkable prior to yesterday.
Grab was bullish on the news, with CEO Anthony Tan coming out positively before the deal was even confirmed. Tan said in a company-wide memo that we obtained that Uber’s exit was proof a regional rival could defeat Uber.
“They’ve lost once, and we will make them lose again,” he told his staff.
Fighting words indeed, but the conditions that forced Uber’s exit from China simply don’t exist in Southeast Asia which weakens the comparison. The subsidies war is almost certainly multiples more modest than China, and Uber is only just getting round to putting the pedal to the floor in the region.

While Tan publicly rallied his troops, you’d imagine that he was privately disappointed at the way this incident has played out.
Lyft, for one, was more measured with its comment on the Uber-Didi deal.
“Over the next few weeks, we will evaluate our partnership with Didi,” a spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal. “We always believed Didi had a big advantage in China because of the regulatory environment.”
Ola of India declined multiple requests to comment publicly on the deal.
It’ll take some time before the smoke clears and we understand more about how this deal impacts the global ride-sharing economy, but right now it looks like Uber is sitting a lot prettier than many people believe.",2016-08-01,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/kalanick2.jpg?w=738,"grab,ola",Uber’s deal with Didi is a win-win for everyone — except the ‘Anti-Uber Alliance’
425,Jon Russell,"Carousell, a four-year-old startup from Singapore behind a listings app that enables peer-to-peer selling in Southeast Asia, has closed a $35 million Series B round to grow its reach into new countries and increase product development.
The company is seen as one of the darlings of Singapore’s nascent startup ecosystem, given that founding trio Lucas Ngoo, Marcus Tan and Siu Rui Quek all graduated NUS (National University of Singapore) while in their early twenties having spent some time in ‘regular’ jobs. Added to that, this is certainly one of the more notable (largest) Series B rounds for a startup out of Singapore.
The financing was led by existing investor Rakuten Ventures, with participation from returning backers Sequoia (via its India fund which is used for Southeast Asia deals), Golden Gate Ventures and 500 Startups. The startup previously raised a $6 million Series A round in 2014, and an $800,000 seed round in 2013, so a new round was seemingly on the cards before too long.
Indeed, TechCrunch last December reported that Carousell was trying to raise as much as $50 million from investors for this round. The company declined to comment then and, this time around, all Quek (CEO) would say of that report is that Carousell is “super grateful and happy that we have the support of our existing investors.”
The app started out in Singapore as “a passion project to solve our own problems,” Quek said in an interview with TechCrunch. The simplest way to describe Carousell is a Craiglists for mobile via its iOS and Android apps. It uses a chat-style interface with photo uploading options to connect consumers who are interesting in buying-selling items together. The onus is on the individuals to arrange the sale and payment, since, right now, Carousell does not make money from its service.

The company claims to have 35 million listings on its service with 70 new listings added per minute and active users spending 17 minutes inside its app on average. (Not bad, Facebook recently revealed its users spend an average of 50 minutes a day across its core app, Instagram and Messenger, and that’s three apps.)
Today, Carousell spans five countries — Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia — with plans to increase that footprint further. That may also include a foray outside of its existing focus on Southeast Asia, Quek said.
“The problem we are solving is a truly global one,” he explained. “So we’re not bound by any region per se. Other markets [that we expand to] will be outside of Southeast Asia, but we’re doing work to finalize those.”
The company nabbed JJ Chai, who was running Airbnb’s business in Southeast Asia, earlier this year to manage its international expansion plans.
There’s plenty of competition for e-commerce dollars in Southeast Asia, a market where online is estimated to account for less than three percent of all commerce. Aside from Lazada, which took a $1 billion investment from Alibaba this year, there are country-specific players like SoftBank-backed Tokopedia and Matahari Mall, run by retail conglomerate Lippo, in Indonesia, while informal commerce on social networks has grown to the point that even Facebook has dived in. The U.S. giant is testing a social payment system that, alongside a new Facebook Shop feature, encourages users in Southeast Asia to buy and sell items without leaving Facebook’s walls.
Also, somewhat bizarrely, Rakuten, the parent of Rakuten Ventures, has its own Carousell-like social commerce app in Southeast Asia called Rakuma.
“We did not know about the launch of Rakuma,” Quek previously told me. “Rakuten is an investor through their venture capital arm. Rakuten Ventures’ investment in Carousell is non-strategic in nature. We operate independently and are not aware of their strategic plans.”
Tough competition indeed, so perhaps it isn’t surprising that Carousell isn’t thinking about money too much right now. Quek said that the company (and its investors) are focused on scaling its app and that, while open to monetization potential in the future, there’s no immediate plan to do at this point.
He did however emphasize that he is bullish that, once the time comes, Carousell won’t have problems bringing in cash.
“The Carousell business model is essentially the classifieds model, which traditionally has [around] 50 percent margins,” he said. “We’re not reinventing the business model just reimagining the experience. We will eventually bring in monetization.”
“Our immediate focus is on channeling all our energy to expanding internationally and making sure we have a strong product and engineering team,” he added.
On that last note, Carousell currently has over 90 staff of whom around 24 are engineers. Quek said he hopes to double that engineering headcount by the end of this year. The big focuses for that team, he said, included improved search and buyer-selling matching, and a reduction in spam listings.
As for an eventual exit strategy, such as Southeast Asia’s first notable startup IPO? You guessed it, no comment on that for now.
“We haven’t really discussed exit options, the focus is always on making the largest impact,” Quek told TechCrunch. “We’re just getting started, international expansion will be one of our top most focuses.”",2016-08-01,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/carousell-hero-image_10june.png?w=738,"golden-gate-ventures,rakuten-ventures,carousell",Southeast Asia-based Carousell raises $35M for its social commerce app
426,"Jon Russell,Ingrid Lunden","China’s Didi Chuxing and Uber have now both confirmed that Didi has agreed to buy Uber’s separate business in China — Uber China — as a path to trying to get the two unprofitable on-demand transportation businesses into the black. The deal had been heavily speculated earlier today.
The two companies will retain distinct brands, app and business operations, and it sounds like the backends will be merged. Didi said it will “integrate the managerial and technological experience and expertise of the two teams.”
Didi’s explanation of the financials notes that Uber will be given a 5.89 percent stake in the newly merged entity, with preferential equity that is equal to a 17.7 percent economic interest in Didi Chuxing. Existing Uber China investors, which include China’s dominant search firm Baidu, will get 2.3 percent of the new business.
Meanwhile, Uber’s CEO Travis Kalanick may have come as close as he ever has to admitting Uber may not be able to win on its own in every market where it chooses to operate:
“Uber and Didi Chuxing are investing billions of dollars in China, and both companies have yet to turn a profit there,” he notes in a blog post that we have obtained and which is going up soon. “Getting to profitability is the only way to build a sustainable business that can best serve Chinese riders, drivers and cities over the long term.” (We have included the full blog post below.)
The official announcement from Didi does not specify how much actual money is changing hands in this deal. Didi, which claims 15 million drivers and 300 million users in China, simply said it will “obtain a minority equity interest in Uber.”
However, when Bloomberg first broke news of the deal, it reported that it will include Didi making a $1 billion investment in Uber’s global business. As a point of reference, Uber China was lagging Didi in all the metrics that are considered key to ‘winning’ in this sector: Didi had raised more money, it was valued higher, and it alleged that it had a bigger footprint.
On that latter point, both liked to argue this point, and they seem to have reached a PR detente on the back of today’s news: Kalanick in a separate Facebook post doesn’t provide a number to compare his service to Didi’s directly, noting 40 million trips per week, as well as 150 million trips monthly in the Uber blog.
Most recently, Uber China was valued at around $7 billion, while Didi was valued at $28 billion.
This deal was at least one month in the making, possibly longer: we’d heard murmurs of it going down in early July, but were unable to confirm them at the time.
There’s also some people moving around, too. Cheng Wei, founder and chairman of Didi Chuxing, is joining Uber’s board, and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is joining Didi’s board in return.
Cheng, after a period of ruthless and expensive competition with Uber, now is settling into being a magnanimous winner:
Didi President Jean Liu also noted that this does not take away from Didi’s wider global ambitions:
The announcement throws up a lot of questions about the direct consequences of this deal, and also what it might imply for the future of Uber.
For starters, you have to wonder how this will impact the wider competitive landscape in other markets outside of China, if Uber’s CEO is now on the board of Didi and Didi’s CEO is now on Uber’s board. Didi is an investor in all of Uber’s key regional competitors: Lyft (U.S.), Ola (India) and Grab (Southeast Asia). All that we know for now is that the Chinese company said it will “continue to work with global partners” following this deal with Uber.
There is also the issue of who may now a part investor in Uber as a result of this deal: Didi’s investors include Alibaba, Apple, DST, Softbank and Tencent.
There is also a question here about the business model of building these kinds of businesses. Uber, which has raised tens of billions of dollars to build out its operations across global markets, had been developing Uber China as a separate entity, with its own funding structure, but it seems that even with billions, it was not enough to compete against Didi.
For its part, the homegrown rival has most recently said that it was profitable in some 200 of its markets, but not all 360. This implies that even with scale, it’s a waiting game to see how the economics ultimately balance out in favor of profit. Interestingly, by eating up your chief rivals, you can then afford to invest less in competing, with all the discounts and marketing that comes with that.
And, while time may be the best judge of this, this also raises the question of what this could mean for how Uber positions itself in any market where it is struggling and deciding that it may be investing too much to try to win.
The company has been going all-in on new categories like food delivery, and the company has more generally been exercising its ambitions to be a one-stop shop for all kinds of transporting, whether the parcel is an object or a person.
But while Uber has proven to be a formidable rival, might Uber be changing strategy, and choosing now to merge in other markets where it has decided it’s not worth the investment to try to crush the competition? The very concept throws something of a lifeline to competitors who may have thought it might be impossible to fight a war of escalating investment in the past. One transportation rival, Grab, has already come out with a statement that rivalling Uber might not be a losing battle after all.
Blog post from Uber CEO Travis Kalanick that is going up later:

427,Jon Russell,"Didi Chuxing’s proposed acquisition of Uber’s Chinese business hasn’t even been confirmed, but the significance of the deal has already prompted responses from others in the global ride-hailing industry.
Anthony Tan who is the CEO of Grab, the company that rivals Uber in Southeast Asia and took investment from Didi last year, told his staff today that reports of a merger to create a $35 billion ride-sharing giant in China are proof that local competitors can beat Uber.
“After more than a year of intense competition, our investor and global partner Didi has effectively won the battle for market share dominance in China,” Tan wrote in a company-wide email obtained by TechCrunch.
“Didi’s success reinforces what we have believed all along,” he added. “That we live in a very diverse world and there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Localized solutions best solve local problems. Like Didi did in China, we make sure that the unique pain points of users in Singapore or Jakarta or Manila will get addressed because they are prioritised over the competing needs of users in New York or London or Istanbul.”
We reported last week that Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia are already profitable in two markets — Singapore and the Philippines — and that the U.S. firm is making a major move to launch new products across the region. That strategy makes more sense now given today’s reports of a China exit.
Along those lines, Tan cautioned that Uber’s withdrawal from China will likely mean that the company significantly ups its game in Southeast Asia.
“With the deal in China, we expect Uber to turn more attention and divert resources to our region,” he told Grab staff.
“But we have seen that when the local champion stays true to their beliefs and strengths, they can prevail. We see this happening in China, and it will be the same here. They’ve lost once, and we will make them lose again.”
Uber is widely believed to be leaving China after finding the country to be unsustainable due, in a major part, to Didi’s significant war chest which has funded a subsidy war that has reportedly cost Uber $2 billion to date. It looks like CEO Travis Kalanick has called time on that battle, perhaps to focus on an IPO next year.
The stakes are not so high in Southeast Asia, where online commerce and digital spending is far lower, but a cumulative population of more than 600 million makes it a region that could be hugely significant as its digital economy matures. So, while it isn’t surprising that Tan is rallying his troops with this message, it isn’t clear just how much intel from Didi’s ‘win’ can be applied to Grab’s own battle with Uber.
Grab has raised over $650 million to date, including its most recent Series E round of $350 million one year ago at a valuation of around $1.6 billion. It covers 30 cities across Southeast Asia’s six largest countries where it claims 19 million app downloads and 350,000 drivers. Uber is in 16 cities but it doesn’t release figures. Southeast Asia has generally been a lower priority to its efforts in China and India.
Tan’s full memo is below:",2016-07-31,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/grab.png?w=738,"southeast-asia,didi-chuxing,grab",Grab CEO: Didi victory shows we can beat Uber in Southeast Asia
428,Sarah Perez,"A startup called Heek wants to make building websites as simple as chatting over text and answering a few questions. Using a conversational interface, the bot asks you questions about yourself, your business and your site, then lets you click to see different designs you can customize to meet your needs. The bot will even prompt you to save your work, as you get further into the site creation process.
Many of today’s chatbots have fallen short when it comes being a more efficient way of interacting with a web service, and often lead to frustrating experiences due to their restrictive nature.
But in Heek’s case, the idea of turning website creation into something that can be handled conversationally could appeal to the small business owner who doesn’t have the funds for a professional designer, nor the technical chops to manage website creation – even via the more basic website builders that are on the market today.
Heek’s service is surprisingly easy to use. With a click to get started from the Heek website, the bot begins by asking for your name, your company’s name, the type of business you have, then presents you with a variety of site templates to choose from, ranging from e-commerce storefronts to sites for public figures, charities, businesses without products to sell, or those in the “media/entertainment” space, like news, food, music, sports, education, animals, and more.
You can then click through the available templates in your category by clicking the “Next design” and “Previous design” buttons the bot offers.
Instead of figuring out what sort of things need to be on your website, Heek will suggest items you may want to add. For example, it might recommend that you add your business’s address or a contact form, or a navigation menu for moving between pages. To accept a suggestion, you just click “OK.” To skip it, you’ll click “No thanks” and Heek will move onto the next element to be designed.
Depending on the site you’re working with, you can also customize the pages further, whether that’s uploading your own photos or adding product information and pricing, among other things.
However, not all of the site design is done via this text-based chat. Some things, like swapping out photos and editing the text still require you to interact with the web builder directly. (The right side of the screen shows you your site in progress).
Heek doesn’t exactly explain this to you, but it’s fairly obvious because when you move your cursor overtop images, a pop-up that reads “change image” appears, for instance. You can also click into the text areas and start typing, as well as adjust the text’s font, size, look (bold, italics) and more.

The templates themselves are not entirely rigid, either. Like most WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) website builders, you can drag and drop various elements around the screen to customize the design.
But with Heek, you don’t really have to – out of the box, the site offers placeholder text and stock images to make site creation less of a hassle.
The service costs $30 per month, or $25 per month if you opt to pay annually. This fee includes the site creation, your custom domain name, search engine optimization, and customer support.
However, what’s great about using Heek is that you don’t have to commit to a plan or even create an account to try the service for yourself. By clicking the button on the website to get started, you jump head-first into site creation. If you’re still unsure after your site is finished, you can keep using the service for 14 days before entering your credit card information to keep the site live.
Heek was founded late last year by Nicolas Fayon, previously the co-founder of a Facebook Page customization tool called PageYourself.

“We quickly realized that [small and medium businesses] almost all had the same problem with their online presence: the lack of time, and the lack of knowledge,” explains Fayon as to why he built Heek. “We worked on how to solve that problem and realized that the solution was to give them the same level of service as an agency would, at a very affordable price.”
Fayon notes also that the chatbot will get smarter over time, as more people use the product.
The startup is now one of several focused on making website creation even simpler than via more traditional drag-and-drop editors like those from Wix, Weebly, GoDaddy, Squarespace, and others. Instead, it competes with newer tools like PageCloud, which aims to make editing sites as easy as using Powerpoint, for example. The Disrupt NY 2016 hackathon winner AlexaSite also came up with an idea around editing sites just by using your voice – but it was a hackathon project, not a business you can use today.
Heek’s service was previously only available in private beta, but since the launch of version one last week, it has seen around 2,500 users test it out, Fayon says.
The startup is a team of 10 based in Paris, and is backed by €700K from French fund OK Invest.",2016-10-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-03-at-11-32-21-am.png?w=738,"website-creation,chatbot",Heek is a chatbot that can build you a website
429,Sam O'Keefe,"When you take your next shower, the water flowing from the faucet may just be recycled. That’s the vision fueling Hamwells, a Netherlands-based startup that launched in the Startup Battlefield at Disrupt London 2015.
In the Battlefield, the company presented their e-shower with a re-circulation mode that recycles each drop of water 7 times, significantly reducing the waste that’s inherent in the showering process. About 150 people from around the world pre-ordered the device after Disrupt, and the company will begin shipping to these backers this week.
Hamwells’ Director of Marketing Wouter Chömpff tells TechCrunch that the company has also raised €1.2 million from a group of suppliers and angel investors.
Today, Hamwells is ready to launch its e-shower more broadly. The company is now accepting orders internationally, with orders to customers in the Netherlands delivering within 2 weeks. International orders, however, won’t ship until the second half of 2017.
For customers looking to add a single unit to their home, the e-shower will cost €2,890. Businesses ordering in bulk, defined by the company as over 100 units, will pay just €1,500 each.
Hamwells admits it can’t quite manage large volumes of products across the world from its base in Europe. The company is actively looking to solve that problem for at least one region — the Americas — with plans to launch a subsidiary in the United States as soon as 2017.
Focusing on the U.S. could help locations like California, which in 2016 faced another year of record-setting drought across the state. Solutions like the Hamwells e-shower, which can significantly reduce the amount of water people use when they take their daily showers (by up to 90 percent, the company claims), can help locations like California reduce how much water they need and help stave off future droughts.
In addition to mass-producing the e-shower so the company can get it in the hands of the most people, Hamwells has plans to further enhance the product. Specifically, Chömpff tells TechCrunch that the next iterations of the e-shower will have options to add things like speakers, aromas and steam functionality.
And, like with any connected or “smart” device, the e-shower will have apps. Chömpff says the company plans to build an application platform for the e-shower’s screen, beginning with a weather app that will be available this week. With the app, users will be able to check the weather while taking a shower so they are able to mentally pick out their wardrobe for the day while soaping up.

We’re excited for a former Startup Battlefield contestant making a splash in their industry, and we can’t wait to see what the next batch of startups have in store for us at Disrupt London 2016.

430,Mick Bain,"

While most founders want to make a boatload of money, achieving a stunning exit is hardly the only driver for most entrepreneurs. More often, they’re fueled by the challenge of solving a problem or producing something meaningful, whether it’s an app or an ice cream.
Some want to make a corporate commitment to social responsibility by organizing their business as a B Corporation, with a mission to do good written into the governing documents. So far, 31 states have passed laws allowing companies to incorporate as B Corps.
Customers and job candidates might even prefer mission-driven products and employers over competitors. But do investors?
The B Corp route has been a boon for some. Ben & Jerry’s, Method, Etsy and Warby Parker are among the best known of more than 1,800 businesses in 50 countries that are certified B Corps, meaning they’ve completed a rigorous and sometimes costly process that confirms their claims of being environmentally friendly, socially conscious and worker-friendly. Certification earns them the right to use the increasingly familiar B Corp logo on their cartons, hang tags and websites.
In some cases, B Corp certification can help founders raise capital from like-minded investors and be a differentiator in a crowded marketplace. But B Corp status might sometimes scare off investors who don’t understand it. People tend to be cautious about putting capital into models they don’t comprehend — and rightly so. Some investors incorrectly assume B Corps operate like nonprofits, which is hardly a compelling model for attracting funds for growth-oriented businesses.
Even investors who respect the principles that guide a B Corp startup may hesitate to open their wallets. They may fear that a commitment to social causes might undermine the VCs’ all-consuming quest for profits. It’s not that investors are cold or heartless; rather, they have a fiduciary responsibility to their own investors to achieve the best returns possible on investments. And they themselves operate in a competitive marketplace that is largely driven by financial returns.
Perhaps the best thing you can do as founders of a B Corp — or a startup pondering B Corp status — is to communicate your priorities clearly to one another, to your team and to prospective investors. There’s nothing inherently evil about wanting to be profitable, and there’s no virtue in embracing a lofty vision while your business tanks.
Several VCs have invested in B Corps, so the two are not inconsistent. If you go the B Corp route, be prepared for questions from investors who want to understand how you’ll balance your social mission with the imperative to maximize profits and returns to your shareholders.
If it’s any consolation, even experienced, successful B Corps wrestle with this challenge. A recent Wall Street Journal article detailed the conflict that Patagonia has faced in producing quality clothing while staying true to its values of causing “no unnecessary harm.” Company executives opted to stop buying wool from a chain of South American farms that were under fire by PETA for their treatment of sheep. The decision leveled a financial blow to the 43-year-old company, which had just introduced a popular line of wool clothing.
Every company faces ethical quandaries, of course. But unlike C Corps, whose responsibility is generally squarely to its shareholders, B Corps are specifically permitted to have more nuanced loyalties.
Let’s say your company is fielding two acquisition offers. The $500 million offer moves all jobs overseas to factories that underpay their workers and produce emissions that pollute the environment. The $450 million offer keeps your loyal team in place in their LEED-certified offices. You can see the complexities in squaring your decision with your values as a B Corp business owner, your obligation to your investors and your ethical mission.
Remember that opting not to incorporate as a B Corp doesn’t mean your business must by default espouse greed, selfishness and wanton destruction of natural resources. You can adopt as many earth-friendly and employee-friendly practices as you and your team wish if they are reasonably justified as being in the best interests of your shareholders.
Use only compostable products in your kitchen and restrooms. Give your staff paid time off to tutor in public schools or build houses with Habitat for Humanity. Hold a canned food drive, host blood drives and commit a percentage of your profits to humanitarian causes.
All of these actions can be justified on the grounds that they help you attract and retain the best talent, which in turn makes your company more valuable. The benefits that your startup provides to the community may not be written into your certificate of incorporation, but there’s no reason they can’t be a critical component of your mission.",2016-10-02,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/moneypaths-e1457106389177.jpg?w=738,corporate-social-responsibility,Should your startup take the B Corp route?
431,Lora Kolodny,"The consumer products startup founded by Jessica Alba, The Honest Co., on Friday told The Wall Street Journal that it plans to reformulate its dish soap, laundry detergent and other cleaners after an earlier controversy over their ingredients.
The Honest Co. markets its products as gentler, healthier and more environmentally sustainable than those of mainstream brands in the U.S.
However, reporters with The Wall Street Journal and a third-party testing laboratory earlier found that some products made by The Honest Co. contained ingredients that the company previously said it excluded, namely, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS).
While SLS is used in plenty of soaps and cleaners already, and is generally seen as safe, The Honest Co. claimed it wasn’t the healthiest option for consumers and was harsh.
The Honest Co. claimed, counter to the WSJ’s findings, that its own lab tests never detected SLS in its products. The five-year-old startup also said then that it used sodium coco sulfate not SLS. But SCS happens to be made with SLS commonly, so The Honest Co. remained under scrutiny and is even facing lawsuits over its labeling.
Recently, a deal in the works that could have seen Unilever acquire The Honest Co. for a price in the ballpark of $1 billion derailed at the last minute over pricing considerations, sources tell TechCrunch.
Instead Unilever agreed to acquire The Honest Co. predecessors, Seventh Generation Inc., for an estimated $600 million to $700 million in cash. (Seventh Generation and Unilever have not disclosed the financial terms of their deal.)
Sources involved in M&A dealmaking in the consumer goods industry are also telling TechCrunch it would be highly unlikely if Unilever were to acquire Honest Co. at this point.
But other titans in the field, such as Procter & Gamble, Clorox Co. and Johnson & Johnson, could potentially come courting. They are all rumored to have sniffed around the Santa Monica, Calif. startup already.
Honest Co. has raised $222 million in venture funding to date, and generates about $300 million in revenue annually. It sells its products direct to consumers online, as well as via its own pop-up shops and major retailers like Target, Costco and Whole Foods.

432,Romain Dillet,"Meet Atomic, a prototyping service for your next mobile app or website. It works in your browser, but it’s a lot more powerful than you’d expect. Atomic handles animations and lets you make interactive designs. And you can collaborate on your designs with your team in real time.
The startup launched the version 2 this week adding a bunch of new features that make your design more interactive and easier to create. Atomic launched in September 2015 and costs between $15 and $35 per month. But first, let’s take a step back and look at Atomic’s features.
While there are many native apps for quick prototyping, such as Sketch, they don’t provide a good multiplayer experience. If you’re working with a team of designers, you’ll want to use a service that sits in your browser. In fact, Atomic has released a Sketch plugin so that you can export your designs.
There are many cloud services for interface design, such as Marvel, Proto.io and InVision. Eventually, it depends on the way you like to work, but I can see many designers choosing Atomic over say InVision — the service feels polished and flexible.
When you’re working on a design, it starts with interface drawing. If you’re not using Sketch, you can add buttons, text and images from your browser. Compared to Photoshop, it is tailored to interface design. I’m not sure Atomic is as powerful as Sketch on this front, but you can keep using Sketch for the initial steps as Atomic doesn’t stop there.
You can then add animations and interactions. You get to decide which type of click, tap or swipe you need to do to trigger something. And a sort of mini-video editor lets you configure interface changes based on these interactions. Some parts of your interface can be scripted — “if this happens then do that after 3 seconds.”
With the second version, you can also add text fields in case you’re designing an app that relies a lot on text fields. You can also re-use components of your design in multiple screens.
The ability to re-use parts of your design and work in teams should be a big time saver for teams of designers. And finally, you can preview your designs in your desktop or phone’s browser. Other people can comment and add notes for a specific area of your design. Atomic could be a good way to test different designs before working with developers on the actual implementation.",2016-09-30,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/atomic-3.png?w=738,"interface-design,ux,ui,atomic",Atomic is like Google Docs for interface prototyping
433,Sarah Perez,"We’re taking more digital photos than ever, but we’re not very good about printing them out to enjoy them in our homes. Meanwhile, the digital picture frame market has filled with cheap products that haven’t kept up with technology developments, like ubiquitous Wi-Fi, better photo quality, and higher resolutions, in order to instead chase ever-lower price points. Aura aims to pick up where the industry left off, by offering a digital picture frame that’s beautiful enough to be hung on the wall, but also takes advantage of modern technology, like retina displays, mobile apps, facial recognition, gesture control, and sensors.
The end result is a digital picture frame that’s actually not terrible…in fact, it may even be something to lust after.
Aura was founded by Abdur Chowdhury, the Summize founder who became Twitter’s Chief Scientist, and CTO Eric Jensen. It’s the latest product from their company Pushd, which previously had tried its hand at mobile applications.

The co-founders had both had horrible experiences with the digital picture frames they had bought themselves, which prompted the idea for Aura. They realized there was opportunity to innovate in the digital picture frame market, which had not evolved with the times.
“When we looked at the digital picture frame market, we were shocked at what we found,” explains Chowdhury. “It was and is the anti-technology story. 2006 they take off, but in the next decade, the resolution has not changed. Many no longer exist, and those with Wi-Fi are all but gone. It was a market, in my opinion, ahead of its time, in that the technology did not meet the consumer’s expectations,” he says.
With Aura, the team has built an attractive, 8×12 picture frame that comes in two colors, ivory with rose gold trim or black with charcoal trim. The frame is acrylic, is edged in anodized aluminum, and the kit comes with a stand or accessories for wall hanging. Unfortunately, there’s still a power cord, but it’s wrapped in a cloth material to make it less garish.
 
Meanwhile, the screen is basically the same retina display in your iPad (2,048 x 1,536 resolution), which makes pictures look really crisp and clear.
But what makes Aura interesting, also, is its use of technology in terms of interacting with the device and feeding it content. You use the accompanying mobile app to sync an album you create to the device, or you can take advantage of Aura’s facial recognition software to automate the process.
The app will identify the faces in your photos, then you can toggle on a “Smart Select” feature to automate updating the frame with images. The software not only identifies which photos to send, and continues to update as you take more pictures, it also filters out blurry and bad photos – like those with your eyes closed, duplicates, and those that won’t crop well. There’s a nudity filter, too, for privacy’s sake.
Plus, you can invite family members to collaborate on albums, for a more social experience.

In addition, the frame includes sensors that determine if you’re in the room, and then only changes the photos after you’ve left. That way, when you return, you’re always greeted with a new and different experience. And it can sense when you’ve shut off the lights, so it will turn off, too.
Another clever feature is gesture control. That is, you can use “Minority Report”-like swipe gestures at the sensor to move back and forth between your photos. (I was able to test this myself, and it worked fairly well, though there’s a slight lag. It’s something I could see kids having a lot of fun with, however.)

Though the team was not planning on raising funding, when they talked with Spark Capital GP Kevin Thau, he was interested in this idea of a device that’s ambiently aware of you, and trying to display what you love the most. Spark Capital ended up funding a $6 million Series A for Aura, the company announced this week.
“It’s crazy…we spend so much time in our homes and never surround ourselves with all of the wonderful memories we have captured,” writes Thau, in a blog post.
In the future, you’ll be able to daisy-chain together multiple frames to display photos selected through the software, and the company will eventually expand to include more frame sizes and colors.
The current frame costs $399, which makes it less of a competitor to those low-cost rivals bought for the grandparents, and more like something you buy for yourself, for your own home.
“We think about this product less as a gadget – historically, that’s what this category was. We wanted to make a truly beautiful picture frame, that also happens to be very smart,” explains Jonathan Wirt, Aura’s head of marketing, of the price point and target consumer.
Aura is not yet shipping, but the website is now taking sign-ups. Subscribers will be notified when they launch. At that time, orders will be accepted online, and frames will ship in about a week.",2016-09-30,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/aura-lifestyle-1.jpg?w=738,"digital-photos,digital-frame,aura,pushd","Aura rethinks the digital picture frame with smarter software, sensors & gesture control"
434,John Biggs,"It’s good news and bad news for the publishing industry. The good news is that print revenue was up 3.4 percent in April, primarily in trade paperbacks, with some solid grown in young adult print and religious titles. The bad news is that revenue is down 4.3 percent year-to-date with a 7 percent loss in April compared to 2015. Further, ebook sales were down 22.7% compared to last year. In short, the publishers’ push towards paper is working but for all the wrong reasons.
Revenue is down in ebooks because Amazon, using their mercantile might, has been aggressively selling paperbacks and hardbacks after publishers took away their power to control ebook pricing. Now ebook prices are way up and print prices are way down, a situation that eats into the publishers’ physical distribution models and guts their ebook sales.
Book pundits all over the web are blaming Amazon for its habit of aggressively pricing hardbacks and paperbacks after losing control of ebook pricing.
“Over the past few years the US e-book market has decreased by over 24% and print sales are on the rise. The primary reason for this is due to Amazon not being able to set the digital price anymore, the publishers are doing that,” wrote industry observer Michael Kozlowski. “This has led to an average increase of $5.00 per title and many people find that paying $15.00 for a Kindle book, is too expensive.”
Amazon, for its part, began attacking hardback pricing last August when it priced anticipated titles a few dollars above ebooks prices. One book came out last year with a “$12.70 Kindle edition paired with a $13.37 hardcover” on release day, a move that made little sense in the old way of doing business. In fact, publishers usually drove up release-day pricing to stratospheric levels thereby grabbing a nice boost as hot titles flew off the shelves. But because Amazon buys books wholesale it can price things however it wants without regard to the publishers wishes and because Amazon sells so many books nothing they can do or say can sway the ecommerce behemoth. In short, Amazon is causing revenue to fall month-to-month because it sells so many books.
Publishers got what they wanted: they wrested control over their ebooks from Amazon. But Amazon is faster, smarter, and more reckless than the Big 5 and is quite happy to ruin their business model to sell a few more copies – and force their hand. In the end, publishing is doing itself no favors by trying to beat their biggest distributor and the numbers are backing that up. These print blips, however small, are just that – blips – and when ebook pricing returns to sanity expect to see a lot more revenue from digital channels.",2016-09-30,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/5234548420_e5f6608f7c_o.jpg?w=738,"business,e-book,new-media,publishing",Print and ebook revenue down as Amazon slashes prices
435,Ingrid Lunden,"As we inch closer to a time when we may rely on truly autonomous devices to move us or do things on our behalf, the need for software that’s able to think on its feet (or mid-air) will be essential.
Now, an artificial intelligence startup working on this emerging area of machine learning has raised a seed round of funding to try to do just that. Cambridge, UK-based Prowler.io, which is building a platform that can be used by makers of autonomous systems to help those machines think and learn to make better decisions, has raised £1.5 million ($2 million).
The company is still largely in stealth with little information available online. But CEO Vishal Chatrath tells me that the funding — which comes from Passion Capital, Amadeus Capital and Singapore’s Infocomm Investments — will be used to continue research and development of its platform, as well as hiring more talent to build it.
That new talent will be joining a small but noteworthy team: two of the co-founders, Chatrath and Dr. Dongho Kim (CTO), are both early and core employees of VocalIQ, an AI startup acquired by Apple just 13 months after launch (its tech is being used to build the next generation of Siri). The third co-founder, Aleksi Tukiainen, is coming straight out of graduate school at Cambridge, where he worked on machine learning methods and control systems, with a special focus on collaboration platforms, solar vehicle design and self-learning robots.
Prowler — the name refers to a voracious mind, thinking through all angles of a situation all the time; not a sneaky bot — is working in an area that currently has only a handful of peer companies, but is in demand across a number of industries.
As Chatrath describes it, you can divide the challenges of developing AI into two general branches: perception and decision making.
A lot of what has been created up to now has been on the perception side of the equation: computer vision, image recognition and other systems to help decipher the world around the machine.
These problems, Chatrath said, are as good as fixed, even if they continue to be improved all the time. “From a researchers perspective, perception is a solved problem,” he said. “We know a dog is a dog.” We used to think that no machine could identify a face as well as a human could, and yet now they do.
That leaves the other branch used in building autonomous systems, decision making, which is the area where Prowler has been working.
Up to now, there have not been many companies that have tried to tackle this area at an advanced level. Prowler uses a process called “reinforcement learning,” which is also what Google-owned DeepMind and VocalIQ are using, Chatrath said.
(The alternatives, used in many cases today, are autonomous systems based around premade, hand-crafted rules and Markov design processes, long strings of if/then types of commands, for example. These, however, have their limitations and the more complex a scenario becomes, the less likely that an autonomous system using these rules will be able to cope.)
Chatrath said that the aim of Prowler is to make a platform that will be accessible by way of APIs and a set of pre-made scripts to use its thinking algorithms in a number of places. This could apply in industries like transportation, manufacturing, medicine and hospitality, but for now the first area that Prowler will tackle is the gaming world.
The reason, Chatrath said, is because in games, creators are developing increasingly realistic and graphic interfaces, but a lot of the responsiveness of the characters in those games still feels robotic and repetitive. While gaming might not feel like an “essential” problem like self-driving cars (which could kill people if they don’t work correctly), it’s an existing and very ripe market for perfecting the same technologies. 
And the gaming industry faces the same problem as other industries when it comes to sourcing the technology or the talent to make it: the talent pool capable of building better “personalities” for these characters is pretty small, with companies like Google’s DeepMind snapping everyone up. 
“One reason reinforcement learning is not used more is that DeepMind, for one, has cornered all the people who were experts in reinforcement learning to do general AI,” he said.
That leaves a vacuum for a startup to inspire a few engineers to build a platform that the rest of the world can use.
“We invested in Prowler.io because we see near limitless use cases for next-generation machine and reinforcement learning to revolutionise industries,” said Eileen Burbidge, partner at Passion Capital. “From smart city infrastructure to agriculture to drones, in the very near future powerful artificial intelligence is going to change the world we live in for the better. The huge potential of the technology combined with the calibre of the Prowler.io team make this a very exciting proposition.”
If Prowler is the real deal — and it looks like a couple of NDAs with some strong companies, plus the funding from seasoned AI investors point to it being so — Chatrath says that the intention is not to build a company that simply will be snapped up by a bigger fish.
“We believe this has the potential to exist as an independent,” he said. “I think of this as analogous to Adobe tools for graphic design. In the early days of the mobile industry we didn’t have any job description for user interface designers. You had to be a coder. But Adobe created higher level design tools so that graphic people who didn’t know how to code could make beautiful designs. We want to do the same, building a toolset to help anyone create specific behaviour.”

436,Josh Constine,"SoundCloud as a company is a disaster, but it’s the only streaming service with the DJ sets and remixes kids love. So it makes perfect sense that Spotify is in advanced talks to acquire SoundCloud, the Financial Times reports.
Spotify already declined to buy it twice over the past year and a half; talks broke down over pricing. But since then, SoundCloud has hammered out deals with the major record labels to stop mass take-downs of its content, and its SoundCloud Go $9.99 subscription service flopped. That could make the acquisition less risky and cheaper, sweetening the deal for Spotify.
The negotiations could still fall apart, but if Spotify acquired SoundCloud, it could finally have the weapon it needs to differentiate itself from Apple Music with something Tim Cook can’t just buy.
SoundCloud is the “YouTube of Music.” Creators can upload music and other audio recordings to it directly instead of having to go through a record label or distribution service. That’s helped SoundCloud amass the biggest catalog in streaming: 125 million tracks, compared to around 30 million on Apple Music and Spotify.
But while most music belongs to major record labels with which anyone can strike a streaming deal, what’s on SoundCloud is much more unique. Bedroom demo recordings, multi-hour DJ sets of other people’s dance tracks, unofficial remixes the original artists didn’t authorize.
Some of it is the property of the uploader. Some of it is legally gray or straight-up copyright infringement. Some of it is only allowed because SoundCloud worked with rights management service Dubset to pay the original content creators, a bit like YouTube’s content ID. But users come to SoundCloud because it has what they can’t find anywhere else.

Spotify would surely incur immense legal headaches figuring out how to integrate these tracks if it bought SoundCloud. But liberating this incredible content from SoundCloud’s clunky and sputtering interface and rolling it into Spotify’s polished apps alongside the official music people expect could be a winning combination. Plus, if Spotify wants to diversify its offerings, the podcast and other spoken word content hosted by SoundCloud could broaden its options down the line.
Beyond the content, Spotify might consider firing as much of the SoundCloud team as possible to cut the constant losses endured by the Berlin startup.
No matter what Apple did to pay big performers for early access and exclusives, it wouldn’t have as comprehensive of a catalog as SpotiCloud. If Spotify can make the deal happen without breaking the bank, it might have a better chance of fending off Apple with all its money and platform power.
Luckily, Spotify raised $1 billion in debt financing earlier this year. The investment came with dirty terms that penalize Spotify if it doesn’t IPO successfully, but give it the firepower to make this kind of acquisition. And because Spotify already has its own good-enough radio feature and doesn’t need to buy Pandora, SoundCloud seems like the best use of its war chest.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/spoticloud.png?w=738,"dubset,soundcloud",Spotify could out-dance Apple if it does acquire SoundCloud
437,Tom Goodwin,"

I live a pretty cosmopolitan futuristic life atop a glass skyscraper in New York City, but I’ve yet to get a pizza delivered by drone, order a taxi from Alexa or open a hotel door with my smartwatch. I’ve also not booked a hotel from a bot (because trying that drove me crazy) nor consumed news from one, because that’s a terrible way to do it.
In a world where what’s possible is advancing at breakneck speed, it’s odd that British Airways has developed an emotionally aware smart blanket, but doesn’t “do” email. It’s strange that IKEA has VR to help you experience your kitchen, but struggles with the basics of e-commerce. My car rental company has invested millions in onsite video-calling kiosks, but their app loses 50 percent of the bookings I make.
We’ve got the questions wrong. It shouldn’t be how are you innovating or which project is doing new things, but why are you doing it and on what level. From pizza by emoji or bot or smartwatch, to emoji-inspired aubergine-flavored condoms, we’re experiencing a very superficial type of innovation. It’s something new, physically notable and at the edge of the relevant business. It’s typically the product of a small innovation unit, primarily with the goal of a funky press release, a great photo call or something to talk about on the next earnings call.
And, generally speaking, it’s the wrong types of companies that are doing it. It’s CPG companies with beloved products but perhaps little to talk about. Maybe having a brand worth billions and steady sales is a bit boring. So we have special editions, apps and direct e-commerce with dubious unit economics. We have mattress brands becoming publishers. Why? Because Conde Nast, The New York Times or Hearst make it look easy? Or wildly profitable? Every new SKU is disruptive or, better still, reimagined.
Yet many companies must innovate, desperately. The TV industry is making better shows than they ever have, but is suffering because they have little understanding of modern consumer behavior and choice architecture. We’ve got airlines that use incredible technology to keep their fleets in the sky and on time, but who routinely fail in even the most basic communication functions.
From car rental desks that look shocked when it’s busy to hotels that can’t tell you when your room will be ready and ask for credit card details three times, physical retailers need to adapt to a world in which online shopping has made people impatient, expecting to find things immediately — and to be served even faster.
For all companies, innovation needs to be deeper. Not token gestures on the edge, but fundamental rewiring of business from the core. Imagine a business as an onion of concentric layers. On the outermost surface would be communications — how companies express themselves. Inside this would be marketing — the services, promotions, pricing and products made by the business. At the core, upon which everything else is built, are the business values, culture, processes and systems.
Only the most superficial changes happen at the edge. It’s easiest there, requires the least organizational effort and gets the most visibility. Launching an innovation lab or an incubation fund and a venture unit requires a few bodies in a trendy offsite office, even if they do nothing after the post-launch media hype wears off.
Innovation at the marketing layer is interesting. It’s Honest and Dollar Shave Club, both pretty sizable changes to products or how they are sold, supplied and paid for. But while examples like this have huge valuations and momentum, it’s not clear how groundbreaking they are.
The real examples of innovation come from companies built for the modern age. They’ve taken new behaviors, new technology, new workflows and, above all else, new consumer expectations. Here we see the obvious examples like Uber or Airbnb, but also companies like Facebook, which has become a media owner of vast scale that does not actually make any content.
Here you can compare the revenue and costs of Buzzfeed and compare it to an old-world company like Conde Nast. Let’s consider Netflix relative to Blockbuster, but also Spotify compared to record shops, or Kodak and Instagram. The most rapidly grown companies in the modern age, like Tesla worth $30 billion, or Dropbox, Nest or WhatsApp, have smashed all known expectations of what’s possible because they innovated at the core.
Technology will create vast and profound shifts. The mobile-first world has yet to really arrive. Mobile payments, digital wallets and the Internet of Things will create the best-ever canvas for business.
Technologies like 5G, ultra-fast Wi-Fi, smart cities and other forms of ICT will form the architecture of the world in which businesses will operate. At the same time, people will change. Tolerance of waiting is already near-zero, same-day delivery is expected, as are free returns and UIs must be near-invisible and frictionless.
Maybe you do need an innovation lab. Maybe working with startups is key. Maybe your organization needs impetus and expertise — but for goodness sake, no more iBeacon-driven vending machines, no more 3D-printed trinkets.
Let’s stop thinking of technology as a trendy tattoo — a surface-level commitment best kept on a conspicuous but not often used part of the body.
Let’s think of it as oxygen — essential to the beating heart of your business.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-475158101.jpg?w=738,tech-innovations,Innovation is in all the wrong places
438,Anthony Ha,"MightyTV, an app that helps you figure out what to watch next, is now available on Android.
The startup is led by AdMeld co-founder Brian Adams, and it presents users with a stack of movie and TV recommendations which you swipe through, Tinder-style. If you’ve seen something already, you can say whether or not you liked it, which will influence the recommendations you see next. If you haven’t seen something and it seems appealing, you can save it to your watch list.
The app is also connected to streaming services like Netflix and HBO Go, and it can even recommend things that fit in the overlap between your taste and another user’s.
The Android app should look familiar to users of the MightyTV iPhone app, but Adams said it comes with “a few extra bells and whistles,” most notably a word cloud that the company calls your “MQ”, showing users their favorite genres and actors, based on their swiping data.
Adams also told me that the company has rebuilt the machine learning technology that it uses to try to understand the taste of individual users — he described it as a “hybrid” approach that combines genre-based strategies for recommending movies (e.g., if you liked that war movie, you might like this one, too) with “collaborative filtering” based on user ratings.


MightyTV isn’t releasing the total number of users who have downloaded the app since it launched in April, but it sounds like those users are doing a healthy amount of swiping — Adams said 350 is the average number of swipes in the first week. (And keep in mind that recommendations are the point of the app, while swiping is just the way to get there.)

440,Lora Kolodny,"A startup called Dozr Inc. has raised CAN $2.5 million (or $1.9 million USD) in seed funding to help contractors rent heavy industrial equipment from other construction professionals who have it, but aren’t using it.
Based in Kitchener, Ontario Dozr’s marketplace lets builders rent equipment, like excavators, skidsteers or one day drones and industrial robotics, either alone, or with a licensed operator who can run it for the duration of a given job.
Dozr launched in 2015 and has already amassed more than 2,000 customers and listed more than $50 million worth of equipment on their marketplace.
Dozr’s seed investment was led solely by Fair Ventures, an investment and innovation unit within Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd.
Among its businesses, Fairfax owns large insurance and reinsurance providers, including Federated Insurance, which actually sells insurance to heavy equipment owners via Dozr’s platform.
While focused on the Canadian market to-date, Dozr’s investors expect it will eventually expand into the U.S.
For the near-term, the company plans to use its seed funding to add new features to its platform, and hire employees across sales, marketing, product and engineering.
The company’s founders are family members with experience working in the construction business, together– brothers Kevin and Tim Forestell, and Erin Stephenson who is married to Kevin Forestell.
One feature Dozr plans to add to its site this year will allow users to upload a video when they list equipment for rent.
“With video Dozr will be able to show the condition of equipment as it leaves and as it comes back to a renter, or even how it is used when it’s on the job site,” Kevin Forestell said.
Video appeals to contractors who can hear from different pings, creaks and squeaks how well-maintained a particular machine may be. Video also appeals to insurance providers, because it can help avoid confusion over who may be at fault in cases of damages or accidents involving rented equipment.
The company currently offers users a browser and mobile-optimized version of its marketplace, but will also develop native mobile apps, given their seed funding.
Fair Ventures’ Gerry McGuire said his company backed Dozr because it believes the sharing economy concept can work well for the construction market and heavy, industrial equipment.
Users of industrial equipment face a choice between purchasing expensive equipment or coming up short when they have a job to complete, the investor explained.
“Those who become purchasers in many cases.. face issues of idle equipment and excess capacity. Being able to match the demand of users who may be unable or unwilling to purchase the high-cost equipment with the excess capacity of those who have already purchased equipment makes sense,” he said.
In the U.S. Dozr faces competition from other VC-backed marketplaces for industrial equipment including Yard Club, Getable and EquipmentShare.
Dozr sees itself as differentiated from these marketplaces because it provides insurance directly to equipment owners with every rental, allows renters to book talent not just equipment, and because it has deep experience in markets with inclement weather.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dozr_bulldozer.jpg?w=738,,Dozr raises $1.9 million to become an Airbnb for bulldozers and excavators
441,Josh Constine,"Joining celebrity investors like Snoop Dogg, Ashton Kutcher, and Justin Bieber, Queen Bey is bringing her supreme business skills to the tech world. Beyoncé and the management company she started called Parkwood Entertainment have invested $150,000 into Sidestep, an app for buying concert merchandise and skipping the line to pick it up at the show.
Sidestep originally started selling t-shirts and posters for Beyoncé on her Formation World Tour. But after two weeks of seeing its success, Beyoncé and Parkwood invested in Sidestep’s seed round of funding.
Sidestep CEO Eric Jones tells me they “wanted Beyoncé’s tour to be very focused on tech”, and liked the idea of “a tiny scrappy startup doing the biggest tour in the world.”

Beyoncé previously invested in WTRMLN WTR, a watermelon beverage company. She’s believed to have ties to juicing machine maker Juicero, though that company refuses to talk about their relationship. [Update: Beyonce helped start vegan food company 22 Day Nutrition as well.] She’s also a stakeholder in streaming service Tidal thanks to her agreement to give it early access to her music. With her investment in Sidestep, though, she could directly help artists earn more money.
Musicians hoping to get rich off skimpy streaming royalties are kidding themselves. The real money is in using streaming to get famous and then selling concert tickets and merchandise.
But due to long lines and, you know, wanting to actually see the show, many people avoid buying t-shirts and other merch at concerts. That’s where Sidestep steps in.
The startup lets you order tour merchandise before, during, or even after the show from its smartphone app. You can then Sidestep the merch booth line, flash a QR code at the dedicated pickup spot, and grab your items in seconds. Or you can have them delivered to your home. This way you can be sure to get whatever stuff you want in the right size with no fear of wasting time or it selling out.
Along with Beyoncé gear, you can buy merch from artists like Guns N’ Roses, Fall Out Boy, Selena Gomez, and Weezer via Sidestep. The startup gives artists a ton of data about who’s buying, and keeps a 10% service fee charged to the customer.

Sidestep has raised a total of $1.7 million from Beyoncé and other investors including actor Jared Leto, former Lady Gaga manager Troy Carter and Cross Culture Ventures, and the previous CEO of the LA Dodgers. The app has done over $2 million in sales, up 10X from last year. The company competed in TechCrunch’s 1st And Future sports startup hackathon earlier this year. 
Sidestep will have to compete with other merchandise startups like Merchbar, an Amazon-like webstore, and Yoshirt, which lets fans design custom items with a band’s logos and photos. and some people might rather stand in line than pay 10% extra. But with streaming royalties still unable to make up for the drop in album sales, artists will do whatever they can to sell more shirts, and these startups could flourish.
Meanwhile, top performers like Beyoncé who invest will start stackin’ money in Silicon Valley, not just Hollywood.

442,Roger Lee,"

For startup CEOs, tough economic periods are like stressful stretches in a marriage: They test your mettle while making ugly truths impossible to hide. And these days, amid industry-wide belt-tightening, “down rounds” and a still-moribund (though hopefully improving) IPO market, many venture-backed CEOs are baring it all — or should be — to their board members.
But just how should you, exactly, communicate with your investors when navigating a rough patch? I’m not talking about minor problems, like losing an employee or hitting 90 percent of your revenue plan. I’m talking about big issues, or even life-threatening situations: You’re down to six months’ worth of cash and verging on crisis.
In my experiences as a VC, I come down hard on the side of openness and transparency. Admittedly, being transparent is easy for me and tougher on my CEOs. After all, I’m not the one girding up for a difficult meeting that could make me look bad. But, as I’ve noted, it’s easier to get divorced than rid yourself of a VC investor, who should be your steadfast, long-term partner on this journey. Transparency with your investors builds trust, which facilitates sharing good advice and maximizing options. Lack of trust shuts down all those avenues. Openness with your VCs is not only the “right” strategy, it’s the smartest one. Here is some tactical advice.
First, I believe all CEOs need to be conscious of managing to reality, and not perception. You might be tempted to hide bad news from your board initially, or at least minimize it; if you’ve been media-trained, you know you’re supposed to stay positive and publicly “on message.”
That’s fine, except your investors are not “the public,” or reporters. They’re insiders, and they also often have a lot of experience about how to navigate tricky business situations. They also respect CEOs who admit mistakes, don’t sugar-coat problems and are willing to take calculated risks to improve their businesses. In other words, they respect leaders who are not worried about how big and possibly controversial business moves will be perceived by outsiders.
I work with one software CEO who I’d call a two-time offender of doing the right thing in this regard. Twice in our relationship he’s made proactive, difficult decisions that caused short-term pain for his company and could have led to bad press. But the moves resulted in long-term value for him and investors.
His first decision, made several years ago, was executing a substantial pivot away from an initial business model as an advertising network. Despite the business generating about $20 million of revenue, he concluded it was not creating durable value, so he shut down that business and took the company’s revenue to zero. He then spent the next few years re-building his product and selling it via a SaaS (software-as-a-service) model. Fast-forward to today, and he now has a rapidly growing SaaS business that is far bigger (and much more valuable) that his initial ad network.  Shutting down the initial business and re-starting from scratch took guts, but it was the right long-term decision.
Tough decision No. 2 happened a couple of years later when this CEO essentially fired one-third of his SaaS customers because he wanted to migrate to larger enterprise accounts. His existing base of smaller customers simply wasn’t profitable. This stalled the company’s revenue for a year as it back-filled its sales pipeline with larger deals, but the company emerged with a much more stable (and profitable!) customer base.
This CEO also exemplified another piece of advice I give my CEOs: In bad times, you should own the problem, and then over-communicate when it comes to informing your board about it and exploring solutions.
In other words, don’t pass the buck. CEOs who don’t own their problems waste energy blaming other people — energy that should be funneled toward fixing their companies.
Once you’ve taken ownership, waste no time in bringing your board members into the conversation, and hold nothing back. At those early meetings held to discuss the problem, lay out the issues clearly, demonstrate you’ve studied them from all sides and present your straw-man recommendation. I call this a “straw man” because it may or may not be your ultimate move, but it’s your best idea right now. Stay open to changing your mind after talking with your board members; that’s the benefit such conversations can offer. You should speak to mentors and other CEOs you trust, as well.
Depending on the severity of the issue, you may also want to set up weekly calls to keep your board abreast of the situation and solicit ongoing feedback. In one recent situation with a portfolio company, we had a standing call every week for roughly six months as the executives worked through a very tricky financing situation. This consistency was very helpful to both the CEO and the board as it kept everyone in sync, built trust and allowed us to successfully navigate the situation.
The next logical step is getting tactical. My advice for companies in trouble is to focus maniacally on one or two key business metrics that directly correlate to the health of the company. This might be driving website traffic, reducing customer churn, slashing expenses or simply getting to break-even by any means necessary. In this situation, having fun and cultivating a quirky company culture are no longer high priorities.
Fold up the ping pong tables and turn off the craft beer on tap — you’ve got serious work to do. You’ll be surprised at the clarity this new focus brings. In addition, your go-forward plan needs tactical milestones to prove it’s working. Report on those milestones regularly to your board. Solicit their advice, and come to meetings prepared with ideas if things aren’t working as planned.
My portfolio company HotelTonight was recently profiled in the press for successfully transitioning from a high-burn business into a fast-growing, profitable company. One of the key ingredients to this transition was CEO Sam Shank’s insistence that the team focus on two KPIs (key performance indicators) — increasing revenue and reducing expenses — according to a strict plan. This may sound like an obvious way for a company to improve its fortunes, but too many companies get distracted by other metrics. In this case, HotelTonight’s laser-like focus on these two KPIs made it virtually certain the company would move past its rough patch and set itself up for future success.

To avoid this do-or-die situation, I advise entrepreneurs to maximize their options by running parallel plays. In the case above, had the CEO executed a dual-track process of pursuing the possible acquisition and keeping the bridge financing as a backup option, I think the outcome would have been far better for the company and the employees. Acting early, and being open-minded, almost always expands your choices, and means you won’t get stuck with your worst option.
Being an entrepreneur and/or startup CEO is, obviously, extremely hard. It is particularly hard when things are not going well. However, communicating early, often and openly with your board can increase the chances you’ll navigate the rough patches and build a company with lasting value.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-182939162.jpg?w=738,"ceos,communication,board-of-directors,startup-advice",How to communicate with your board in tough times
443,Lora Kolodny,"The accelerator and seed-stage fund for business to business startups, Alchemist Accelerator, and the curated co-working community called Rocketspace, have partnered up in a way that should help both expand their influence beyond the San Francisco Bay Area.
According to Alchemist managing partner Ravi Belani, startups admitted to the next cohort of the accelerator will work together in Rocketspace’s flagship location in San Francisco. And they will be able to attain favorable rates on office space there after they graduate.
Rocketspace founder and CEO Duncan Logan said one thing that differentiates his business from the likes of WeWork or newer and regional challengers like Coworkrs in New York or Techspace in England is a kind of admissions process. “It’s not like if you can pay the rent you can be here,” he said.
Rocketspace charges startups for the desks they use, but generates a chunk of its revenue from corporate innovation initiatives.
“We make sure large corporations are not just taking a tour of San Francisco startups to pinch ideas that will inform some later product, but we also help large employers figure out how to find and work with the best startups in advantageous ways,” he explained. “So it matters who we invite in.”
While it’s hard to measure exactly, Logan said an estimated 55% of startups that attain corporate meetings through Rocketspace can successfully strike a partnership, enter a pilot or trial, or raise an investment from them.
Business service providers with real estate at the core of their offerings—including WeWork, the 800 lb. gorilla at this point, Breather and Liquidspace– have attracted venture capital and gained popularity in recent years.
But Rocketspace was early in the field, founded in 2011. Previous residents of Rocketspace have included founding teams from Uber, Practice Fusion, Leap Motion and Spotify who set up a Silicon Valley beachhead there in their early years.
And the company recently raised a venture round of $336 million in equity and debt financing to grow its business, specifically in Asia.
Partnering with accelerators that already have a strong reputation, like Alchemist Accelerator, should help Rocketspace tap into a supply of already-vetted tenants.

444,Romain Dillet,"Front has been around for three years, but the startup is only releasing a proper mobile app now. If you’re a Front user, it brings all the features from the desktop version to your phone so that you can manage emails and other communication protocols in multiplayer mode.
Front’s basic premise is quite simple. With Front, you can collaborate, comment, assign and reply to those pesky emails that you receive on your support@, jobs@ or contact@ email addresses.
For instance, if your company receives an interesting application on your jobs@yourcompany.com email address but it’s not for your department, you can assign it to the right person and it will notify them. This person can then communicate with their team using comments, emojis, @-mentions and everything you’d expect from a modern communication tool. And of course, they can also reply to the first email.
With the iOS app, teams can receive notifications on their phones, contribute to collaborative drafts, send canned responses and triage all the incoming messages on various email addresses, Twitter accounts, Facebook accounts and more.
It seems crazy that Front managed to get so far without a mobile app. The company has just hit $2 million in annual recurring revenue. Companies like Stripe, Twilio, Cisco and ServiceNow are using Front internally.
And finally, Front has just hired Peter Ahn who built the New York sales team and the media sales team for Dropbox. He then helped shape the enterprise sales team for Slack. He’ll handle the business development team at Front.
So that’s a lot of news at once, but it seems like Front wants to iterate quickly on all fronts with major product updates and a more efficient sales and business development strategy.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/newsletter.png?w=738,"email,front",Front launches a mobile app for its inbox for teams
445,Ingrid Lunden,"Google has been focusing for years on finding better ways to track and measure ads as we switch from one device to another to consume media like TV, music or written articles like this one. And now, to coincide with Ad Week in New York this week, Google is revealing its latest moves in that effort: over the next few months the company will expand Brand Lift from measuring online  video to cover TV; it’s letting businesses ad Google Maps data and photos to their ads; and in a very Facebook-like move, it is moving away from cookies and using logged-in data to track and market to users across multiple devices, apps and sites.
To be clear, these are updates to existing products for Google, but taken together they are a sign of how the company is trying to shift how it identifies people in an ever-changing digital world that includes smartphones alongside computers and more traditional screens like TVs; and how it’s trying to harness more of its immense footprint across services like maps, email and Android to stay on top in advertising.
Google has traditionally relied on cookies and mobile IDs to identify and track users for remarketing lists. But this isn’t effective enough for cross-device and cross-channel campaigns, which is why the company has been making the switch to logged-in data, something it first started to kick off a year ago with its launch of Customer Match, which matched up a business’s email lists with Google’s own databases of logged in users to figure out more about their customers and advertise to them more directly.
Google is not throwing out cookies and declaring them completely stale, but it’s a clear move away from them. “I call it the depreciation of the cookie,” McGowan, himself an ex-Googler who used to head up ad strategy at the company, told me.
The reason for the shift has less to do with trends like the rise of ad blockers, which impacts the effectiveness of things like cookies. This could feasibly become an issue over time, but relatively speaking today these are used by a very small part of the population.
More to the point is the rise of Facebook and the growth of its own ad network and Facebook Custom Audiences, based on its own logged-in user data. Google may not have ever managed to build a successful social network of its own, but Gmail alone has over 1 billion logged-in users, and when you start to add in data from other services like Android, YouTube, Maps and Google Now (all of which also tie into your ID), you can see how Google has reached a tipping point where the cookie may not be as appetising as it used to be.
The three updates today all point to how Google is upping its game with stronger ad tech to meet today’s media consumption trends.
Brand Lift is a product that has been around since 2011 but up to now most of the updates have been around improving what and how it measures online video ads largely around the world’s biggest online video property, Google-owned YouTube. Given the work that other companies like Twitter have made to integrate and match up its online network with “offline” or simultaneous TV watching (in order to better demonstrate to advertisers that it really does pay to have a presence on Twitter), it seems almost overdue and surprising that it’s only today that Google is extending Brand Lift to TV.
Less surprising are Google’s claims of what it is finding from early tests of the product: it says that YouTube generates nearly twice as many searches per impression than TV. (This makes sense, since you are already online and it’s very easy to simply click on a video ad.)
Regardless, there has been a longstanding disconnect between how popular offline media like TV and print remain for advertising (they still account for a majority of ad spend), and where it is that people are actually consuming that media. Advertisers would like to see more proof of what’s being viewed and where, and so this could help bridge that gap a little big more.
Google says that initially it will work in the U.S. only but that it will extend to globally “soon.”
The second update points to another way that Google will be drawing in its Maps product closer to its advertising business.
This is aimed at mobile advertising, and builds on location-based advertising that Google already provides, as well as metrics that Google already measures about whether a person who has searched for a store actually visits it and buys something. This is already a fairly extensive business for the search giant: based on data it already collects, Google says that today some 30% of smartphone users who visit a website or app on their phone buy something in a store within 24 hours.
For starters, Google will now load up location-based interstitial and display ads with more actual location data. Based on a trial Google ran with Home Depot in a 15-mile radius of a Home Depot store it will work like this: advertisers will first target ads based on the physical location of where a user is doing a search. Google will draw on not just the location and a person’s previous search history, but also any other data it happens to have about that user and his/her interests based on its trove of “lookalike” audience data.

Then when the ad is served, users will get more location information around the company in question, including map links to make the visit a little more frictionless.
And after a user visits a physical location, if they have their phone on them, Google will be able to track that and feed this back to the advertiser to measure the impact. To improve attribution, some of the other data points that Google picks up include “micro-conversions” (like whether a user ever selected click-to-call from a search or Maps search; whether a user has ever tried to search for store directions; etc.) and also “macro-conversions” (actual store sales).
The third update, around cross-device remarketing — will be how Google makes its ads more ubiquitous across different screens and different devices.
Covering both the Google Display Network and DoubleClick Bid Manager, Google says it will give advertisers more transparency and control over how this is done. It will also give it a stronger play against the likes of Facebook’s own strong data set around its own users.
Google’s example of how this will work is a Halloween campaign: in the morning a user may see an ad for a sale on costumes in the morning while reading the news on her smartphone. In the evening, when on a tablet, that same user can now be served an ad from the same company while browsing on a tablet or computer, this time with a specific offer.
In the past, advertisers could serve ads in this way only across specific devices because of the use of cookies and Android IDs, and otherwise the best that they could get was data on how their ads were being viewed. Now, with logged-in data, it looks like control of the ad experience will extend to a far wider range of places to track and sell to you. On that note, while it sounds potentially a little more big brother, it also means that you can opt out of the tracking by logging out.",2016-09-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/crossdevice_halloween-ads-loop_128-1_091616_v2-1.gif?w=640,advertising,"Google embraces the log-in, leaving cookies behind in new advertising updates"
446,Josh Constine,"Unless you plan on bumping into stuff, don’t expect to record after-dark concerts and parties on your Snap Inc Spectacles. The company formerly known as Snapchat (they really should have just changed it to the 👻 emoji, Prince-style) confirms to me its new camera glasses are not currently built to be worn at night. Their lenses are like normal sunglasses, so it’d be too shady to see with them on.
This fact reinforces the idea of Spectacles as “a toy”. That’s how Snap CEO Evan Spiegel referred to them while talking to the Wall Street Journal, which never mentioned they’re for day-use only.

When the $130 Specs are released this fall, you might have to stick to barbecues and day-time music festivals when you want to tap the rim of your glasses to record 10 seconds of circular, first-person video.
Perhaps future iterations could come with clear lenses or photochromatic light-adaptive lenses that are dark in the sun and transparent at night or indoors. By ditching extra functionality to keep the price reasonable, Snapchat may be able to market the glasses as an aspirational buy for its teen user base. That will go smoother if it can align Spectacles with celebrities people want to emulate.

The first version of Spectacles might not be as transformational of a technology as some hoped. Yet it gives Snapchat more control of the image capture and saving experience. With time, engineering, and product finesse, Specs could evolve into something we see ourselves wearing whenever we go somewhere we want to share.
But if public perception lumps them in with geeky Google Glass or unnecessary Flipcams, Spiegel will have spent a lot of Snap’s $2 billion-plus in venture capital on something just for him to play with.

447,John Mannes,"The art of the lip sync has had a profound impact on the state of our…ok no, but dammit is lip synching fun.
For those of you locked in a Faraday cage, pretending to sing has become all the rage these days. You have Michelle Obama doing it for Carpool Karaoke, Tim Cook using it to open up events, and of course the ever entertaining LL Cool J and Chrissy Teigen using it as a platform for the Spike series, Lip Sync Battle. On the show, celebrities battle each other by pretending to sing songs with dramatic effect. With a new app, anyone can now jam out in battles with their friends.
It’s quite hard to go wrong with such a fun starting point, and for the most part, the app’s creators Wurrly, Spike TV, and Casey Patterson Entertainment, don’t let us down. Upon opening the app and selecting create, users are presented with a list of genres including pop, rock, rap, country, classics, and latin. There are also themed categories like love songs and a special section for tracks coming from prior Lip Sync Battles. Once you pick a song, the next step is to get to work recording.
Rather than just straight recording on top of an audio track like in Dubsmash, songs are accompanied with lyrics to make it possible to record in one take. Users can also select a number of accessories that serve a similar purpose as lenses in Snapchat. You can go for a crazy glasses vibe, a cat ears look, and even a full flower child outfit. 
Wurrly did most of the development of the accessories and facial tracking in house. The groundwork has already been laid alongside another company called Facio to do emotional recognition. This means that in the future, tattoos, masks and other accessories will be able to alter their appearance based on your emotional state. If you’re singing a sad verse in a ballad, a mask could animate differently than during the power hook of a pop song.
“Our intention was really to create a world of fun,” said Nadine Levitt, CEO of Wurrly.
At the end of filming your epic production, there is a list of post processing effects you can choose from to put the final touches on a battle. This includes things like confetti intros, lights and pyro effects.
Apps that license songs often struggle to build up and maintain a healthy and attractive music catalog. Levitt cites a relationship with Universal Music Group as one of the key factors that helped to get the licensing process off the ground. The starting library is diverse and even includes a number of country songs that haven’t garnered much attention on the show itself. Levitt sees the app as a way to continue to build the Lip Sync Battle community.
To generate revenue, Wurrly will be offering specialty items to its community at a price. This could include limited addition effects and masks. Because the app has such a strong relationship with a real world show generating new content every week, Lip Sync Battle can also benefit by leveraging promotional content to boost fan engagement.
The early version of the app works pretty smoothly although one drawback is that creations are tied to the app itself. You can share them for battles and link videos on social media, but they ultimately pull you back into the app. Synching between lyrics and music was also an issue in a few instances. Lyrics for the Eminem and Rihanna track Love the Way You Lie seemed oddly timed, and in one case, the lyrics for the Lynyrd Skynyrd hit Free Bird were incorrect. These were all relatively minor quips and will hopefully be fixed by the time heavy traffic starts battling.
If you’re not already into the craze, the premise of lip syncing may seem about as odd as watching American Idol on mute while listening to the track on Spotify. However, there is something special about a nonjudgemental space where you can truly step away and not care about anything other than having fun with your friends. I spent about an hour after 5pm on a Friday making the gem below in the TechCrunch offices. I can’t completely say there was no office judgement, but as promised, it surely was a world of fun.

448,Haje Jan Kamps,"There’s no denying that your smartphone’s camera is getting better and better for every generation, but what’s a poor photography nerd to do about controllability? Miggo’s Kickstarter-funded Pictar is shipping soon, and might be just the thing to teach your iPhone some additional photography skills. At Photokina, I had a chance to try it myself.
“Smartphones have great cameras,” says Sean Henry, the photography industry veteran who brought Pictar to life. “But for advanced users, the functions are either hidden or hard to get to.”
Pictar is a fantastically clever solution to that precise problem. It adds a grip with a shutter button and three control wheels to the iPhone. One of the wheels controls the zoom, one is programmable to a number of different functions, and the last is an exposure compensation wheel. The shutter button includes focus / exposure lock on a half-press much like you would find on traditional cameras. And, of course, it takes a photo when you depress the button fully.

Pictar is one of those rare products that I never really knew I needed in my life until I tried it myself. Yes, it seems dumb and it is so easy to write it off as a gimmick… But you’d be wrong to do that until you’ve tried it. I’ve certainly never felt I needed a real shutter button on my phone. Having said that, the feeling of relief of being able to make adjustments by turning wheels rather than having to do complicated multi-touch or touch-and-hold maneuvers is strong. As a photographer, the product makes the iPhone feel like a much more capable piece of photographic kit, which is a remarkable accomplishment by Miggo.
All of that isn’t to say that the product is completely perfect; the button-press for the shutter button felt a bit stiff compared to what you find even on an entry-level compact camera, and it’s hard to know by feel whether or not you’ve succeeded in doing a half-press. The turn wheels also felt a bit cheap — cheaper than its $120 price tag would indicate. If there’s ever a second version of it, I hope the manufacturers either drop the price or increase the feel of the product to be more in line with the phones it is designed to contain.
“We are shipping in December,” Henry confirms. “If you want one as soon as possible, pre-order sooner rather than later!”",2016-09-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/20160924-_dsc3356.jpg?w=738,"photokina-2016,smartphone-accessories,miggo","Hands-on with Pictar, which adds buttons and wheels to your iPhone camera"
449,Travis Bernard,"Snapchat’s current geofilter product is a nightmare for event managers, brands, and any commercial business because anyone can coat-tail or hijack the space.
Let’s say you’re holding a political rally at City Hall, and you want to buy a geofilter for the augmented Snapchat space at the event. When you go to purchase it from Snapchat, your plan gets rejected.
Why? Someone else has already bought the augmented space.
Snapchat’s current policy is “first come, first served,” and you can’t reserve a geofilter more than 30 days in advance. The first person to book at 12:01 AM 30 days ahead of an event will always get the geofilter. There’s also a cap on the number of geofilters that can exist within a designated space.
This means that anyone can hijack your digital space and promote a brand, cause or idea… as long as they “get” there first.
In the case of the political rally, your opponent uses the geofilter to blanket the augmented Snapchat space with something counter to the cause. Something nasty. Something that will make your event attendees sick.
That sucks for the group holding the event.
It doesn’t necessarily have to be a heated political move. It could just be a cheap, cringe-worthy ad. Or a company trying to sponsor a space where they don’t feel like buying the physical or digital ad space from the event holder.
It just happened to us at Disrupt.
Reflik advertised in our augmented space without being a sponsor. I have nothing against the former Disrupt Startup Alley company. We love that startups want to be a part of our events even if founders can’t travel there.
They played within the rules Snapchat made, but the rules need to change.
One solution would be to introduce a verified tier that gives you control over your own space. If the venue owners see their space being used inappropriately, they could request a take-down from Snapchat.
Another solution would be to remove limits on the number of geofilters that can exist in an augmented space. This could create a spammy experience on Snapchat, but at least if you forgot to book the geofilter 30 days ahead of time you would still be able to make a last-minute play with filters to engage your Snapchat audience. Snapchat would also make more money by doing this.
But there’s a better opportunity out there for Snapchat; one that could make them a lot more money off the product.
Snapchat should introduce an auction-style bidding system for geofilters.
Think about it. It makes a lot of sense.
A bidding system would net Snapchat more money, eliminate low-quality advertisers that can’t compete and make the system less of a headache for brands, event planners, and commercial businesses.
There’s a reason that companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter all use live bidding systems for ad networks: It works.
Snapchat has made a name for itself by always doing the opposite. Their ad platform has a weird set of rules with unconventional formats, and the geofilter product is no different.
The reason Snapchat geofilters are an increasingly valuable ad unit is because everyday folks can play on the same level as big brands, generating longer and more attentive eyeballs than other ads.
While it’s important that the rules allow for brands and commercial businesses to protect their space, it’s equally important that geofilters maintain their grass-roots experience.
Snapchat has always done a great job pushing the creative envelope, but on the back end of their geofilters system it might help them to do what brands, advertisers, and businesses want, and what advertising titans are already doing: create a bidding platform. This would result in fewer headaches for advertisers and more fans of the geofilters product in the ad industry.

450,Sarah Perez,"In just over a week, Apple’s iMessage App Store has grown to over 1,650 applications and sticker packs – more than the original iPhone had at launch as well as the 1,000 total that were ready for iPad at the time of its debut, but far less than the 3,500+ the Watch App Store arrived with last year. According to a new report from Sensor Tower, the most popular type of mini mobile application is the “sticker pack” – the store includes 1,251 of these, the firm says, alongside 402 other, non-sticker iMessage apps.
The iMessage App Store is Apple’s latest attempt at building a platform that allows third-party developers to market their software to the sizable iPhone user base. It arrives at a time when the original iOS App Store has become so cluttered with out-of-date and abandoned applications – so much so, that Apple has implemented a store-wide cleanup process that could impact hundreds of thousands of apps.
Meanwhile, iMessage App Store reflects a shift in the way users are finding and using applications.

Instead of seeking out standalone apps to stick on homescreens, where they are often forgotten, many people are looking for add-ons that enhance their mobile messaging experience. To date, that has included everything from custom keyboards to apps that help you more easily add flavor and humor to your messages, like apps for sharing GIFs, emoji, stickers, and more.
In addition, some of the most popular applications on the App Store today are those that offer a richer messaging experience from within their own walls, such as Facebook Messenger (the #3 free app), Snapchat (#5), or WhatsApp (#15), for example.
Apple hopes to better cater to this messaging audience with the revamped iMessage app which launched last week along with iOS 10.
The new iMessage turns the texting app into a platform, and introduces a number of new features, like effects which let you decorate the screen with animation and sound, pixelate messages with “invisible ink,” link previews, handwritten notes, quick responses via tapbacks, emoji suggestions, and more.

Its biggest feature, though, is that it opens up the platform to apps.
But despite being a new way to interact with apps, the new App Store is already mirroring the trends we see in the wider app marketplace – that is, games are still dominating.
According to Sensor Tower’s data, of the 402 non-sticker apps on the new storefront, the largest category is games. There are already 92 games available for download, which almost 2.5 times the number of apps in the second-largest category, Entertainment (39).
Rounding out the top 10 categories are Utilities (31), Productivity (26), Social Networking (25), Photo & Video (23), Travel (21), Education (18), Health & Fitness (17), and Food & Drink (15).
What’s interesting is that there are very few News apps – only 6 are currently live. That’s very different from Facebook Messenger, for example. According to Messenger head David Marcus, speaking recently at TechCrunch Disrupt, news bots were one of the categories it found did very well on its chat platform. There are already dozens of these available, according to the bot-tracking site Botlist.

Stickers, however, are far more popular than apps – and the most surefire way to generate revenue for developers. Of the 1,251 sticker packs, 944 are premium (paid) downloads, while 307 are free.
The majority (86%) are $0.99, while some are $1.99 (12%), and fewer still are priced higher at $2.99 (1%). The most expensive pack – and there’s just one – is priced at $3.99.
While this early look into the iMessage App Store helps paint a picture of what developers are building, it doesn’t yet indicate which apps consumers are actually downloading. That data will come in time as more people upgrade to new iPhones, update their current devices with the new OS, and discover the world of iMessage apps.
Third-party app intelligence firms, such as Sensor Tower or App Annie, will also have to incorporate iMessage App downloads into their intelligence products in time, to help give the industry more insight into apps’ popularity and traction – especially because the store has no “Top Charts” section at present. And as developers see for themselves what the audience is responding to, the selection of available apps will adjust in time, too.",2016-09-23,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/imessage-app-store-hero.jpg?w=738,"mobile,imessage-app-store,imessage,apps","Apple’s iMessage App Store already has over 1,650 apps, majority are sticker packs"
451,Anthony Ha,"iHeartRadio could be getting more competitive with on-demand music services like Apple Music and Spotify next year.
Launched by the radio and media company Clear Channel (which has since rebranded as iHeartMedia), iHeartRadio gives users the ability to listen to broadcast radio on their computers and phones, as well as listening to online stations designed around specific musical artists.
Put another way, it’s been a fairly radio-like experience, rather than letting you listen to whatever song you want, on-demand. That’s scheduled to change in January, with the just-announced iHeartRadio Plus and iHeartRadio All Access plans. All Access is the easier one to explain — it’s a full on-demand music subscription, like those services mentioned up top. iHeartRadio Plus is something in between — as iHeartMedia CEO Bob Pittman explained it to me, when users are listening to the radio and hear a song they like, they’ll be able to instantly replay it and save it to playlists. iHeartRadio Plus listeners will also have unlimited song skips.
Pittman argued that the Plus plan, in particular, is meant to complement other on-demand services. So you might have a Spotify subscription while still listening to iHeartRadio, maybe because you like the personality or musical taste of a certain DJ, or because you want to find new artists, or maybe you just can’t be bothered to choose exactly what to listen to. The Plus plan keeps that dynamic in place while adding a bit of the on-demand experience to the radio side.
“It’s not designed to be a lesser version of Spotify, it’s meant to be a radio station with extra features and functionality,” Pittman said. “If the consumer thinks this service is sort of like Spotify, we’ve failed.”
At the same time, Pittman said that 84 percent of iHeartRadio’s users don’t subscribe to any on-demand service. So if they’re looking for one, why not check out the All Access?
“There’s this huge piece of the population that does not spend money in any form on music,” he added. “We think this is the kind of service that will begin to get them to spend on music.”
It may seem a bit late to be getting into the on-demand music market, but Pittman pointed to the enormous reach that iHeartMedia already has — more than 90 million registered users for iHeartRadio, and more than 250 million listeners total.

As for whether he’ll pursue the exclusives that streaming services seem to be using to compete with each other, Pittman said, “I don’t think anybody, other than broadcast, has enough reach to ever do an exclusive to the exclusion of others.” Sure, exclusives might “make money for a service,” but those services are not big enough “to break a record.”
Pittman said it’s too soon to share pricing information. However, The New York Post reported earlier this week that the services will cost $5 a month (for Plus) and $10 a month (for All Access).",2016-09-23,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/crossplatform_v5_r2.jpg?w=738,"bob-pittman,iheartmedia,iheartradio","iHeartRadio will launch two paid, on-demand music services"
452,Lora Kolodny,"Although self-driving vehicles feel like a near future reality, people still need driver’s licenses to get around independently in cars today.
Now, an Austin, Texas startup called Aceable has raised $4 million in Series A funding to deliver driver’s education in a mobile app. Silverton Partners and Floodgate Ventures co-led the round.
Aceable’s app alleviates the need for drivers (or would-be drivers) to attend courses in person and on someone else’s schedule. Once they take a driver’s ed course via Aceable, users typically have to go take a final driving and written test at their local Department of Motor Vehicles.
Floodgate founding partner Mike Maples Jr. said his firm appreciated Aceable’s focused approach to education and invested in the Series A because the startup has executed well on its initial plans. Floodgate also backed edtech companies Chegg and Clever.
“Aceable has shown early signs of being a ‘capitalist mutation.’ Other companies have tended to pick ed-tech segments that are obvious and crowded…When you think about it in hindsight, it’s obvious:  If you want to drive, you have to take drivers’ ed and this applies at all times, not just during high school and college,” Maples said.
Not all states accept digital education for licensure. But many do, and Aceable is already operational with local, regulatory approvals in: Texas, Florida, California, Ohio and Illinois.
The company will be expanding to Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Indiana over the next year. Additionally, Aceable plans to use its funding to develop curriculum beyond driver’s ed, said CEO and founder Blake Garrett.
That makes sense, in part because younger generations are not as likely to get driver’s licenses as their elders. Blame it on everything from ridesharing to hoverboards. But one University of Michigan study found that just 24.5% of 16 year olds had a driver’s license in 2014, a drop from 46.2% in 1983.
Luckily for Aceable’s long-term prospects, an estimated 25% of jobs in the U.S. require certifications of some kind. Examples include real estate agents, nurses, personal fitness trainers and bartenders.
The company is evaluating nascent industry segments too, Garrett said.
For example, commercial drone operators in the U.S. have to pass an aeronautical knowledge test and register their unmanned aerial vehicles with the FAA. And owners and operators of marijuana dispensaries require different training and certifications depending on state laws.

453,Matthew Lynley,"Instacart COO Ravi Gupta will say that a bad day working in the on-demand economy can be plenty demoralizing even if offset by good well-paid days, and Instacart is going to be making some changes in order to even things out.
Today, the company said it is removing its tipping option in favor of raising guaranteed delivery rates for its shoppers. Instead of shoppers relying on something around $5 per delivery plus tips, shoppers will now probably make somewhere around $10-12 per delivery, Gupta said, though the final value will depend on the market. The goal of the change, Gupta says, is to smooth out the earnings curve for shoppers and make it less reliant on spikes in tips.
“Our current structure has shoppers being really reliant on tips for earnings,” Gupta said. “It could work better for our shoppers. The reason is, 20% of our customers don’t tip. That’s a really tough experience of or shoppers.”
In addition, to continue smoothing out that earnings curve, Instacart is going to start estimating the future earnings of shoppers based on the amount of time they are expected to work. That information is based on their previous delivery history among other factors. That change is geared toward giving shoppers a better way to plan out their weeks in order to make the money that they are looking to make.
In lieu of tipping, but still looking to continue rewarding the company’s best shoppers, the top 20% of the highest-rated shoppers will be receiving a $100 bonus at the end of the week. Adding a level of competitiveness might end up making things more demoralizing or difficult for shoppers, but Gupta said that because shoppers are working independently of each other, it isn’t something that they expect to have an impact on shopper behavior.

All these changes appear to be attempting to do two things: keeping shoppers — especially the best ones — working on Instacart, and trying to streamline the delivery process by encouraging shoppers to do more deliveries and get a guaranteed rate. By doing that, Instacart can not only pull back on its needs to acquire new shoppers, but encourage shoppers to try to end up driving more revenue to Instacart. But in cases where shoppers, say savvy ones that know which neighborhoods tip the best or perform better, that are accustomed to large tips might end up in a situation where they end up less. (That’s where the bonus comes in, largely.)
“What we’ve heard from shoppers is the low moments hurt more than the high moments are good,” Gupta said. “The moments of doing delivery and not getting a tip, it hurts more. I don’t think we feel like overall every shopper is gonna make more money by this approach. What we say with confidence is there’s dramatically more consistency and for every delivery I know I’m gonna make a fair amount.”
The on-demand economy can be seen as a punishing environment with difficult unit economics and high overhead. Instacart is one of the prime examples of an on-demand company, one of the earliest and looking to essentially remake the grocery shopping experience. But instead of just focusing on taking a share of the delivery in addition to grocery store partnerships, the company is looking to start attracting advertising revenue from consumer packaged goods companies.
All this can start driving the cost to the customers further down, and convince them to continue buying things through Instacart. If they can effectively drive that cost to zero, it could make Instacart much more attractive to potential customers and build up a habit within them. CEO Apoorva Mehta laid out the plans at TechCrunch Disrupt SF earlier this month. There, Mehta said he believed the company to being cash-flow positive in the next year.
“We have partnerships with hundreds of retailers who also do a revenue share with us, but we also have CPG companies such as Pepsi, Proctor & Gamble, who promote their products on Instacart,” Mehta said. “As a result of that we have a third source of revenue most people forget about. The key point here is that all on-demand companies do not look the same.”
Still, all of this at the end of the day is to give shoppers more confidence in working with Instacart and continue driving the company forward. There’s a common perception that Instacart is in a tough position (many Silicon Valley watchers will echo the refrain that they are in rough shape), but if it continues to scale, that allows it to better convince new partners, gather more data for its advertising business, and eventually prove to its investors that it can be a strong sustainable business.",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/disrupt_sf16_apoorva_mehta-4077.jpg?w=738,on-demand,"Instacart raises guaranteed delivery payout rates, removing tipping option"
454,Josh Constine,"Facebook sees 30 million updates to profiles each day, but it can’t build every tool to keep your photos and videos interesting. So today it’s globally rolling out its Profile Expression Kit to all developers. This makes it easy to add media like Vine videos, Boomerang GIFs, Beauty+ enhanced selfies, MSQRD face filters, Lollicam stickers, and Flixel cinemagraphs (seen above) as your profile pic.
Facebook launched Profile Expression Kit with just these six partners in April at its F8 conference. But now any app can apply to add the Profile Expression Kit SDK that lets you turn one of their creations into your profile pic or video. In exchange, the app will get a shout-out and link to download in the News Feed post announcing your new profile image, which are amongst the most popular stories on Facebook.
In fact, Facebook’s product manager Aigerim Shorman tells me “Profiles are the second most visited surface on Facebook after News Feed.” That means working with the Profile Expression Kit could get apps a ton of exposure, which is critical considering how crowded the app stores are and how expensive app install ads have become.
Launch partner Flixel’s Chief Marketing Officer Robert Lendvai tells me “We knew that being invited to join the Profile Expression Kit beta was a huge opportunity for Flixel and Facebook didn’t disappoint. Flixel was the only startup introduced onstage at F8, and the media coverage in the days afterwards helped us close a funding round that included an investment from 500 Startups. Facebook has helped Flixel put cinemagraphs on the map in a very big way.”
As I discussed in my feature piece “Facebook’s next big platform: your camera”, Facebook has often relied on developers to provide more customized experiences it couldn’t code by itself. The original app platform filled Facebook with a variety of games to play, while Open Graph let you show off your Spotify listening or the books you’ve read.
Facebook doesn’t have to pay developers to build this stuff. Instead it just dangles its greatest resource — users. Developers are desperate for traction, and will make Facebook more dynamic if its gets them downloads.
Though Snapchat might have the best native expression filters and lenses, Facebook is now fighting back with its platform. By crowdsourcing fun ways to show off your face, it could lure in teens with more creativity tools than any one company could build itself.",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/facebook-profile-expression-kit.gif?w=680,,Facebook enlists developers to outdo Snapchat’s filters with Profile Expression Kit
455,Josh Constine,"Facebook’s chat app wants to help you and your friends decide where to go for dinner or what movie to see, then use machine learning to remind you to pay them back. Today Messenger users on iOS and Android in the US get two new features which could roll out to other countries if they test well.
Facebook tells me “We look at this chat assist function with polls and payments as just another example of offering help to make Messenger users lives easier – like offering a ride with Uber, for example.”
Polls lets you write a question and some possible answers, send them to everyone in a group chat, and then see what’s most popular so you can make plans together.

It’s essentially Facebook’s original Polls feature from 2007, which was later scrapped. It’s also reminiscent of the Facebook Questions feature, which launched in 2010 as a Quora-like Q&A option for News Feed sharing, but then aligned with my recommendation to pivot towards lightweight polling in 2011. Facebook scaled the feature back to only appear in Events and Groups. Now it’s coming to chat, accessible from the message options bar above the composer, or inside the More drawer.
Facebook writes that it could help “get groups of people to make decisions and plans [such as] which day to meet up for coffee, where to go on the next family vacation, and much more.” Other apps like Twitter, Google+, and Tinder’s new Stacks iMessage app also offer polling features. But by building it into a 1 billion user chat app where people already organize get-togethers and ask opinions of friends, Messenger Polls could fit naturally in our lives.

Messenger’s new “chat assist” feature for payments uses machine learning to scan the text you and your friends write, looking for indicators that someone should be sent money. Phrases like “IOU”, or possibly “You owe me $10” or “Send me $18 for dinner” will trigger Messenger to insert a payment button like “Pay $18” below the message.
Friends can then decide whether to click and quickly send money from a debit card number you enter or have previously connected to Messenger.
Facebook first launched friend-to-friend payments in March 2015, and just opened up payments to chatbots. But now you won’t have to beg and nag people as directly to settle their debts. Facebook’s AI will swoop in. Facebook already has some know-how here since the head of Messenger David Marcus and its VP of Product Stan Chudnovsky both came from PayPal.
Making payments a seamless part of the conversation experience could lure people away from siloed apps like Venmo, PayPal, and Square Cash which solely handle payments and not everyone has. Combining Messenger’s ubiquity with a simple payments feature could keep people running all their communication, words or dollars, through Facebook’s chat app.

456,Haje Jan Kamps,"When was the last time you printed a photo? Well, Fotr is a new iPhone app that wants to turn that trend on its head, by automatically printing every photo you take. The idea is to bring back an aspect of analog photography: shoot fewer, but higher-quality photos.
Photo printing is far from dead. At Photokina, I saw a new camera from Polaroid with a printer built in. Leica launched its Sofort, a fancy Instax camera. A propos Instax, fashion designer Michael Kors got involved with a special edition of the instant-print camera aimed at the fashionista crowd. And I finally had a chance to play with the Impossible Project’s I-1, an interesting new take on the instant-print camera segment.
Fotr mimics the behavior of these instant-print images by printing your photos for you, whether you want them or not.
“Today people take near-infinite numbers of photos. They end up stored on a hard drives and nobody has enough time to go through all of them. We wanted to make them tangible,” Ondrej Loudil, Fotr’s founder explains. “You can forget about the tons of unseen photos with Fotr: the app will print all the pictures you take. No exceptions.”
Once you’ve captured an image using the Fotr app, the images are printed and shipped to you within 10 days.
“Many professional photographers recommend getting an analogue camera to improve your photography skills,” says Ondrej. “Film is expensive, so it makes you think before you take a picture.”
The company claims that hidden in the restriction of having to pay for every print, is a creative liberation.

So, is it a good idea? Hard to say; there’s definitely something to be said for only printing photos that are any good, and you can get prints made at a lower cost than Fotr. As someone who’s spent countless hours in a darkroom developing and printing photos, I think the theory behind the app is sound. Being forced to be more aware of your photography can do wonders for a user’s photographic output. I doubt a lot of users will make Fotr their main photography app, but maybe it’s worth to spend (up to) $35 on getting your creative juices flowing.",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/fotr-prints-03.jpg?w=738,"photokina-2016,photo-printing",Fotr forces you to print every iPhone photo you take
457,Darrell Etherington,"Game streaming is something that everyone working in streamed video wants a part of, and now Facebook Live can stream Android games (and other apps) via the BlueStacks desktop emulator for PC and Mac. The integration is pretty smart, and while it was previously available for Twitch, the addition of Facebook Live support means mobile games streamers can potentially reach a different, more varied audience than they might encounter on Amazon’s more gamer-centric streaming network.
You can tweak your layout, too, customizing how viewers see your game stream, with all configurations designed to appear in square aspect ratio in order to work best on mobile. There’s also built-in metrics, including how many are watching, the live chat from FB and Likes.
BlueStacks also says that their integration means you can focus on streaming and not worry about having to awkwardly hold or fumble with your phone. On the flip side, however, using the desktop emulator means you won’t have touch interaction unless you have a touch-enabled Windows PC, and it also means you’re not going to get quite the same play experience you would on an Android phone, which could be a big stumbling block for games that require fast-twitch control input.
Still, this should be a helpful feature for streamers looking to expand their reach with the help of FB’s new tools.

458,Anthony Ha,"For those of you following Instagram’s ad business, my headline might seem a bit familiar — yes, the Facebook-owned photo-sharing service announced another advertiser milestone back in February, but at the time there were only 200,000 advertisers, less than half of the 500,000 advertisers that Instagram says it has today.
To be clear, the company says that’s the number of active advertisers in a given month, so it’s not counting someone who ran a campaign a year ago and never came back. And it says 1.5 million businesses have converted to the new business profiles that launched at the beginning of summer.
This time around, the big message is that Instagram campaigns aren’t just about reaching eyeballs, but also convincing users to buy products. For one thing, the company says that since the global launch of the ad program last September, Instagram ads have driven one billion user actions. It also says those ads drive a 2 percent lift in offline sales.
As an example, Instagram points to handbag brand Dagne Dover, whose Instagram campaign combined a Shop Now button with targeting at students, mothers, professionals and women interested in fashion and travel, ultimately increasing return on ad spend 13x in two months.

Quarles told me that Instagram will be giving businesses more data in this vein. In addition, it will be rolling out “different ways to tell stories” (so, more ad formats) and doing more to understand the “customer journey” (which could help advertisers show you the right ad at the right time, rather than trying to sell you a product before you’re interested).
As for whether or not users can expect to see more ads in their Instagram feed, Quarles said that the company is monitoring engagement closely, and that there’s no set ratio of ads to non-ads. The key, he said is to make sure that ads are “relevant to you … they’re as well-crafted, they’re as high quality as all the content in people’s feeds.”",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/instagram-icon-2016z.jpg?w=738,james-quarles,And now there are 500K active advertisers on Instagram
459,Josh Constine,"With a little personal shopping assistance, Operator thinks Chinese citizens will pounce on American products sold through its conversational shopping app. The promise of becoming the guided commerce layer connecting China with the US has earned the two-year-old a $15 million series B round at a $100 million pre-money valuation.
“We’re making commerce borderless”, Operator CEO Robin Chan told me.
GGV Capital, which specializes in US-China startups, led the round and its partner Hans Tung will become a board observer. Tung praised Operator’s “mass-market-first approach” and its understanding of “the value of creating a global company from the start” rather than trying to bolt China onto an app built for the US.
Other new investors include Formation8, Morningside Ventures and billionaire Li Ka Shing’s Horizons Ventures. Existing investors Greylock Partners and Expa from Operator’s April $10 million, $40 million pre valuation Series A also participated
Hugo Barra, former Google Android VP and current VP of Xiaomi Global, will join the board to bring his China chops. Operator China will start a logistics and marketing office in Shanghai led by Yolanda Xue, former VP of merchandising at mobile commerce at Wish. They’ll give Operator a home town edge rather than coming in blind from abroad.
Operator’s iOS, Android beta, and Facebook Messenger interfaces let people browse categories of topics like apparel, shoes, cosmetics, gifts, home goods, and electronics. They can get the goods delivered from the closest, cheapest possible source. If needed, users message a chatbot for help, which will connect them with a human expert in that product category who earns a commission on what they sell.
The idea is to fill the gap between ecommerce and brick-and-mortar by combining the convenience of shopping from anywhere with the personalized customer service of being there in person. Though there’s potential for this model in the US, Operator is still trying to find viral growth.

But its new strategy revealed today attacks a ripe market. To get goods from the US, Chinese buyers typically have to risk purchasing fake knock-offs, expensively have someone else shop for them abroad in person, actually travel themselves, or endure a distant ecommerce experience on sites like JD or Alibaba where they might have trouble reading English reviews.
With Operator, Chinese citizens will be able to text chat with a human shopping expert from the US with Chinese language skills. They can show the customer products that fit the price, quality, and style they’re looking for, even if the buyer is unfamiliar with US brands.
Chan says “We’re trying to pioneer a new type of global commerce.” That might sound exciting, but it will be tough work to educate consumers about a totally foreign way to buy things. But Chan is resolute in his belief in “a standalone messaging platform that looks like a commerce platform.” After 20 years of shopping on websites, Operator could bring back a human touch at scale.",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/operator-china.png?w=680,"conversational-commerce,chatbots,operator","Operator harnesses chatbots, humans, and $15M to sell US goods to China"
460,Haje Jan Kamps,"You may know Yi Technologies from its action cameras or its fancy, carbon-fiber drones, but at Photokina, the company launched its first mirrorless Micro Four Thirds camera, the Yi M1. Sporting a 20 mpx Sony IMX269 sensor, a high-quality 3-inch touch-screen and a raft of sharing-friendly features, it’s crashing into a space that has been stale for a while.
At launch, the company has two lenses available – a decent all-rounder in the form of a 12-40mm f/3.5-5.6 lens, and a portrait prime clocking in at 42.5mm f/1.8. The camera uses the Micro Four Thirds (MFT) lens mount, however, so it’s possible to tap into years and years worth of high-quality glass from a number of different manufacturers already.
I had a chance to try the camera and I was initially underwhelmed; weighing in at 280g, I found it hard to keep stable (it weighs a third of my everyday shooter, which itself is a tiny little thing carved out of a block of metal) and the controls were counter-intuitive enough that I didn’t immediately make friends with them. As someone who handles a lot of different cameras; that’s pretty rare and a little worrying.
It’s possible that the company is falling victim to its “minimalist design”. Minimalist is all good and well, of course, until you need to quickly adjust the settings on your camera. For much of the same reason that it is tricky to use Lytro’s Illum, controlling the Yi M1 feels a bit ham-fisted to experienced photographers.
In not including decent controls on the camera, it makes you wonder who this little thing is for. Yes, it’s small and has a good sensor, so you’d think it’d be perfect for travel photographers, but because its lenses don’t collapse out of the way, it isn’t as portable as you might want.
DIYPhotography reports that the price for the camera plus a lens will be $499, although the folks manning the booth resolutely refused to comment on the pricing, saying it was “still being confirmed”. The company does confirm it is shipping the camera later this year, however.

I only spent a few minutes with the camera and it is entirely possible that it grows on you after extended use. Unfortunately, cameras aren’t bought on extended use, but on reviews and on first impressions in person. Yi had best cross its fingers for glowing versions of the former, because on the latter, it falls significantly short of the mark.

461,"Devin Coldewey,Ingrid Lunden","Ephemeral media app Snapchat appears to be doing a little disappearing itself. A leaked video and domain records suggest that the company (though probably not the app) is preparing to rebrand as Snap, Inc. alongside its first piece of hardware, a pair of camera-equipped sunglasses called Spectacles.
The video, taken down from YouTube after a copyright claim by Snapchat, briefly shows the glasses: big, swoopy shades with an integrated camera above the left eye. But we pretty much knew these things existed already: Snapchat bought camera-glasses company Vergeance for $15 million in 2014, and what we see is basically a rebranded version of their device.

As for the new brand, a halo of circumstantial evidence makes it highly unlikely this is a hoax or spec ad. We checked out Snap.com and Spectacles.com — the pages are empty, but a whois lookup shows they’re registered to the same person. The same person who also happens to have registered Snapchat.com.

Then, the logo. You may have seen some Snapchat ghosts on billboards around New York lately that have rather crazier eyes than normal. Notice something about this one captured by Michael Sippey?
That right eye (its right; our left) in particular seems familiar, doesn’t it? It also matches the shape of the camera and LED ring light on the glasses.
It’s unlikely that the Snapchat app itself will be renamed — that would be brand suicide. Instead, Snap Inc. is likely to be the umbrella company that administers the various properties in this burgeoning media platform.
It’s possible that this is not the final form of the device or logo; the video could be a promo or pitch for internal use, developed by an ad agency or design firm. Don’t be put off by the fact that it’s middle-aged folks and grandparents using the service rather than a bunch of teenagers — Snapchat has been working hard to target demographics other than the 13-25 crowd.
We’ve reached out to Snapchat regarding the authenticity of the video and the move to Snap, Inc.

462,Darrell Etherington,"Google will build upon its OnHub strategy with a new simple Wi-Fi router for the home, according to a new report from Android Police. Dubbed simply Google WiFi, It will cost $129, the site reports, and will debut at an event Google has announced for October 4, where many suspect the search giant will reveal its latest own-brand Android phones, a 4K-capable Chromecast device and the availability date for Google Home, its Amazon Echo competitor.
The new Wi-Fi router’s highlight feature might be that it can pair up with others to offer easy ways to extend your home network throughout the home, for better network coverage in hard to reach places. Droid-life describes the functionality as similar to how Eero works, in a corroborating report, which basically means the routers will work together with a minimum of fuss to extend your network.
Many modern routers can extend your network, but with the model used by Eero (and Google WiFi, if this report proves accurate), there’s virtually no setup required on the user’s part to spread their network around. Droid-life’s info says it’ll support AC1200 dual-band networking, and have Bluetooth connectivity.
It may or may not be actually branded in the OnHub family, but the reports say it’ll work with existing OnHub devices and offer similar features, including IFTTT integration.

Turning any surface into an impromptu tripod with its sticky-backed superpowers, the $49 Podo already zoomed past its $50,000 crowdfunding goal on Kickstarter.
Last year’s campaign had the company selling its diminutive cameras at a cool hundred bob. Now, Podo comes a-knocking with an even better deal: Better connectivity, better sensors, better lens, and half the price. Yowzers!
The camera shoots 5MP photos — nothing to set the world on fire, but more than enough for sharing on social media. It also happily whirrs along filming 720p video at 30fps. The cam comes with a built-in battery rechargeable via USB, 8GB worth of memory. In short, the camera goes a long way towards making photography fun again for people who know they want some flexibility beyond what their smartphones can offer them.
The micro-adhesive sticky pad attaches by squishing it into a wall, tree, or fence — and when you’re done with it, giving it a rinse restores it to its original, super-sticky condition so it can be reused again and again.

464,Darrell Etherington,"Rolling robots will soon be making U.S. house calls, beginning with a trial run in Washington, D.C. this fall. Municipal regulators have approved use of Starship Technologies’ rolling delivery drones for urban delivery via sidewalk, reports Recode, giving the Estonian startup a vector for its first states-side public tests.
You might remember Starship Technologies from the launch of its public tests across Europe in July, which are taking place in the U.K., Germany and Switzerland. The startup was founded by Skype co-founders Janus Friis and Ahti Heinla, and clearly targets a very different problem from their previous company.
Starship’s decidedly earthbound robots are very reminiscent of wheeled coolers (and they actually can keep things cool, too — useful for grocery delivery), with six wheels and a large antenna for receiving orders from central dispatch. They’re pokey when compared to vehicles, with a max speed of 10 mph, but about as fast as a lot of joggers. They can carry around 40 pounds within their gently domed interior, which makes for a decent haul of groceries (especially for single- or double-occupant households).

Washington, D.C. is the first to make the driverless ice boxes sidewalk-legal, but Starship has also tested their bots in San Francisco thanks to a temporary, limited permit granted by the city there, as the SF Chronicle reported today.
The biggest question these tests might answer is whether or not Starship’s driving drones can handle public exposure in the U.S. I spoke to Starship comms manager Henry Harris-Burland when they began their European trials and he told me that in their 5,000 miles of more limited testing prior to that launch, they hadn’t encountered any incidents of abuse, but real-world use at scale will probably provide very different results, especially once the bots start operating without human chaperones.",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/starship-drone.png?w=738,"drone-delivery,grocery-delivery,starship-technologies","Grocery deliveries via rolling drone will kick off in Washington, D.C. this fall"

But the future is here and JBL Reflect Aware is the first active-noise canceling soldier in the battle against the headphone jack.
These $199 sports headphones are designed as a sort of showcase for the capabilities of Lightning-powered headphones. They offer your standard in-ear earbud design with soft silicone tips for either sports or regular use. The Lightning connector ads some smarts to the whole thing thanks to on-board noise cancellation that can be turned on and off with a click of the fairly large microphone/volume control button.
I had some trouble plugging these in on my iPhone 6s Plus – they weren’t supported at first – but a reboot fixed the issue. Obviously if you have a headphone jack you might as well just get the old-fashioned equivalents but if you’re stuck with a Lightning port there are a fair bet.
Sound quality was solid if a little bass-heavy. The country rocker Willin’ by Little Feat received a deep bass thump that you wouldn’t notice other headphones and the noise cancellation cleaned things up considerably – although I wouldn’t depend on these for a long plane ride. The National’s Bloodbuzz Ohio benefitted from some deeper drum sounds and generally everything was slightly improved by the on-board electronics.
For now headphones like the Reflect Aware are gimmicks riding a trend. Soon they’ll be the norm. It’s interesting to see what headphone makers are going to do with the Lightning port especially considering they can power thin and light headphones and offer some audio improvements and better noise cancelling.

467,Jordan Crook,"Pax Labs, makers of some of the world’s most popular loose-leaf flower and nicotine vaporizers, has today announced a new flagship vaporizer in the form of the Pax 3.
Not only is Pax 3 the third generation of Pax’s flagship device, but it also happens to have three ovens for dual-use among both loose-leaf flower and concentrates like oil.
“One of the greatest challenges at Pax is continuing to evolve as the market evolves, and to do so quickly,” said new CEO Tyler Goldman. “Concentrate vaporizers simply weren’t in demand a couple of years ago, but the market is rapidly moving toward different materials, and so are we.”
Though the Pax 3 can be used with both loose-leaf materials and concentrates, it actually comes with three ovens. The first is a full-size oven for heating a big ol’ nug (or other loose-leaf vaporizable flower). The second is also for loose-leaf, but in a smaller amount, meant mostly for quick, solo use. The third oven, however, is a concentrate oven meant for… well, concentrates.
Goldman explains that heating oils and other concentrates is a very different process from heating/vaping flower material, and most users who wanted the preference of either had to buy a totally different product or purchase an awkward add-on to their vaporizers.
With Pax 3, folks can vape however they want, all from the same product.
Alongside the launch of the Pax 3, Pax Labs is introducing its first app. Out of the gate, this app will let users set precise temperature settings, as well as customize their device with their favorite LED colors, signals, etc.
Pax 3 comes in four colors (black, silver, gunmetal, and gold) and will be available in October for a retail price of $275.",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-22-at-7-53-00-am.png?w=738,"tyler-goldman,pax-labs",The new PAX 3 lets you vape both loose-leaf flower and concentrates
468,Jordan Crook,"These days, it’s not uncommon to see folks using oil pens instead of lighting up a good old-fashioned joint. PAX Labs, the makers of the Pax vaporizer line and the JUUL e-cig, are today answering the call.
Meet the PAX Era.
Built in the likeness of the Juul, the PAX Era is a high-quality, temperature-controlled portable oil vaporizer that uses pods to ensure a great user experience. With the same click-in apparatus as the Juul, the Era pod simply snaps into place on the vape so that users don’t have to mess with sticky, drippy oils themselves.
Coincidentally enough, this pod method also puts PAX Labs squarely in control of both the hardware itself, and the distribution of the actual product, via pods.
Goldman likens it to the Keurig model, wherein the Era pods will be sold to specific distributors, who will then fill the pods with Cannabis oil, and sell them again to retail stores.
The first pod partners for the PAX Era include Bloom Farms in California, and The Lab out of Colorado.
To start, the Era will only be available in those markets (California and Colorado), where purchase and use of this type of product is both regulated and legal.
The PAX Era, alongside the PAX 3, will benefit from the new PAX Labs app, which will get more and more features. But the real win for the app is that it will be able to deliver firmware updates to the products themselves as PAX Labs iterates on them during their life cycles.

469,Haje Jan Kamps,"Polaroid’s shiny new camera with a built-in Nink printer, the Snap Touch, is available on pre-sale today, although if my experiences with it at Photokina are anything to go by, it’s probably not worth your hard-earned cash. Run the other way, and buy yourself an Instax Mini 70 instead, for the same price.
The Snap Touch is basically a Polaroid Snap digital camera surgically combined with the company’s Polaroid Zip printer, with a 3.5-inch touch-screen LCD display on the back. In theory, it’s a fantastic idea for a little camera. In practice… wait, I’m getting ahead of myself.
I wanted to love the camera, I really did, but trying to get a good feel for what the Snap Touch is capable of turned out to be an exercise in frustration.
The camera’s 13 megapixel sensor is ridiculously over spec for the little printer. Without getting too geeky here; 13 megapixels printed on a 3×2-inch print means that the camera has 1,500 dots per inch (dpi) to play with. For comparison, super high resolution magazines are typically printed at 300 dpi. I’ve seen photos shot on an iPhone 6 (8 megapixels) printed in 3×2 at 300 dpi that look unbelievably gorgeous. On paper, this should be a winning combo. In print… It wasn’t.
“I’m sorry the photo isn’t so good,” Holger Post, the boss-man at Polaroid’s German PR company told me, after I finally managed to convince him to pose with me for a selfie. “But it’s just because the lights here are terrible. They are flickering so much.”
Curious, I thought, especially given that presumably the company chose the lights on the booth, but to be fair, the lighting could have been better. I had a solution, however: Print a photo directly from my iPhone. The Snap Touch comes with a Bluetooth connection, enabling users to use it as a printer for photos taken elsewhere. Quite ingenious, really.
“I am afraid you can’t print from your phone, sorry,” Post told me. “You can’t connect it.”
“Really? So what is the Bluetooth for?” I replied.
“It doesn’t have Bluetooth,” came the reply.
Which I thought was curious; I had read the company’s press release, which reads “Thanks to Bluetooth connectivity and integration with the Polaroid Print App, users are no longer limited to just printing photos captured by the camera itself. Using Bluetooth and the app, users can now pair the Polaroid Snap Touch with other devices such as smartphones and tablets to transform the device into an instant photoprinter. The app, available free for iOS and Android (…)”
“Then what is the setting in the menu that says Bluetooth for?” I asked.
“Uh… Okay, maybe it has bluetooth, but you need an app.” he said.
“Well, can I download the app?” I asked.
“I suppose you can.” he said.
So I tried to download it, and failed due to Amazing Wi-Fi Fail. Fair enough, that’s not Polaroid’s fault. So I went back to my hotel and downloaded the app, dug out some photos I wanted to print, and headed back to the Polaroid stand at Photokina.
Back at the booth, I was greeted by the Polaroid team, who apologetically told me that I had an iPhone, and that the app wouldn’t work.
“But the press release and your website says iPhones are supported?” I queried.

“Wait, is that official?” I clarified. “Only Android is supported?”
“Yes. Well, for now. The technical people are still working on an iPhone app,” she said.
That’s not completely unusual; the camera is only available on pre-order and Polaroid’s engineers still have a few weeks to get their t’s crossed and their i’s dotted.
But I still really wanted to try out the printer with a photo that wasn’t taken on the camera itself — I wanted to test the printer, after all. So I asked Stephanie if she could please print a photo from her phone. She agreed, and took a selfie of us with her Samsung S7. The photo suffered from bad lighting, of course, but on the phone’s screen, at least, it looked well-exposed, crisp, and as good as you can expect from a trade-show selfie.
After a number of attempts to actually connect to the camera using Bluetooth, she succeeded. But the app crashed. When she tried again, she was able to print off our self portrait.
I should add at this point that if I hadn’t been hell-bent on getting this print, I’d have given up a long time ago. I’ve seen some bad Bluetooth implementations in my life, and this is up there with the worst. It’s possible that Polaroid will sort that out by the time the camera ships, but it’s irrelevant: the photo quality was still woeful.
It’s not all bad, but for every good thing I can think of to say about the camera, something comes along to ruin it. It’s nice that the camera has a 3.5-inch touch screen (although the resolution and quality of the screen is significantly sub-par to every other screen I’ve used in the past year). It’s nice that the camera has Bluetooth (although it’s flaky, the Android app crashes, and there’s no iPhone support). It’s cool that the camera has a built-in printer (although it’s woefully bad). It’s nifty that the prints are also stickers so you can stick your face in interesting places. And I suppose it comes in nice colors, so there’s that.
But ultimately, no amount of sticky-backed pictures and colorful borders can save the Snap Touch from its own flaws. You already have a better camera than this thing on your phone, so you shouldn’t buy it for the camera. The printer it is, then, but that isn’t good enough either.
Polaroid isn’t meant to be a bastion of image quality. That’s a good thing; the lo-fi look is undeniably part of Polaroid’s charm. Unfortunately, the famous Polaroid look is comprehensively stripped away by the company’s Zero Ink (ZINK) printer: even beautifully exposed high-resolution images from a current-generation Samsung smartphone are reduced to garbage that looks like it belongs in the 1990s.
Hell, even the company’s own PR company is basically phoning it in on this one. If I’m being charitable, the PRs were unaware of the camera’s selling points and unable to demo its functionalities to eager journalists. If I’m not being charitable, it’s entirely possible that they knew that the Snap Touch is utter garbage and did everything in their power to prevent me from seeing it.
The Polaroid Snap Touch is available for pre-order today, with a delivery date some time in October. Instead of separating yourself from $180 worth of your hard-earned cash, however, do yourself a favor and buy an Instax Mini 70 camera. The prints are about the same size, but if you’re going to go for the lo-fi novelty of an instant-print camera, you may as well embrace the real Polaroid look.
Ultimately, it’s ironic that a camera carrying the Polaroid brand is unable to deliver Polaroid charm. Until the company is able to deliver a camera that can, find other ways to get your instant photo kicks.",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/polaroid-snap.jpg?w=738,"instax,nink,polaroid",Polaroid’s digital camera with a built-in printer is best avoided
470,Haje Jan Kamps,"Not one for the self-conscious, Ghostdrone 2.0 VR from EHang adds a new twist to flying a UAV around. Rather than using a traditional controller, to fly the Ghostdrone VR, the user dons a headset to get a point-of-view perspective of what the drone is seeing.
The drone is controlled by gestures, touch commands and tilting of a smartphone, while the camera is controlled by the headset. If you manage to fly it into a tree, no worries: The company promises to repair your drone free of charge for a year while you figure out how to avoid running into stuff.
“Flying a drone is too difficult,” says Matthias Hagedorn, the company’s European marketing director. “We wanted to make things both easier and more fun. Ghostdrone 2.0 is a new way to experience drone flying.”
After raising a solid Series A in 2014, followed by an even bigger Series B about a year ago, the company launched its Ghostdrone 2.0 product in the U.S. earlier this year and has since expanded distribution to Germany and the rest of Europe.

Cleverly, while the smartphone is used to control the drone itself, the headset is used to control the camera. Look up and down to tilt the camera up and down — elegant!
The second part of the n00b pilot introduction program is that the drone is un-groundable. Not because it’s indestructible (no drone is), but because if you do manage to smash it into something, EHang has a one-year no-hassle warranty. Free repairs all around (up to a maximum of three times), regardless if the damage is caused by the drone or the pilot malfunctioning.
It isn’t just about hovering about for fun, either. The drone can record 4K video as you’re cruising around for up to 25 minutes at a time. The flight time is monitored, of course, and if a pilot gets close to the limit, visual and audio cues will remind them to place the flying machine carefully on the ground.
The drones can be bought in various shops or direct from the manufacturer. In Europe, the Ghostdrone 2.0 VR retails at €989. In the U.S., it is adorned with a $1,100 price tag.

472,Romain Dillet,"Apple is rumored to be in talks to acquire McLaren, but that’s not all. While the New York Times was digging on the McLaren story, they also found out that Apple is also talking with Lit Motors for a potential acquisition.
Now you might be thinking “Lit who?” While Lit Motors is nowhere as big as McLaren, it’s another interesting company in the automotive space.
The company participated in the Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt SF back in 2012. At the time, the team had an impressive on-stage demo, allowing them to finish at the second place.
The San Francisco-based startup is developing a new kind of electric vehicle. It’s a sort of electric motorcycle with a few tricks up its sleeve. In particular, you can’t tip it over because it uses gyros to stabilize itself.
Sure, gyros have become quite common with the so-called hoverboards. But it’s still impressive to try and kick over a big vehicle like this one and see that it doesn’t move an inch.
According to CrunchBase, the company has only raised $2.2 million in total. It’s unclear if the company still has money today to survive as an independent entity or if it has been looking for an acquirer.
Apple has been working on a car project for a few years now. While it’s still a secretive project, there are plenty of rumors going around. In particular, the company is fighting with many other car and tech companies for talent.
Acquiring Lit Motors could be a great way to have a few talented engineers join the car project. We’ve reached out to Lit Motors and will update this post if we hear back.

473,Romain Dillet,"Surprise! You thought you were done with iOS 10 beta for a while? Apple already released the iOS 10.1 beta 1 for developers. This beta has one new feature in particular — the Portrait mode that takes advantage of both cameras in the iPhone 7 Plus.
If you remember Apple’s press conference on September 7, the company talked about a really neat feature for the iPhone 7 Plus camera. If you want to take a portrait with background blur, the iPhone 7 Plus can take advantage of its two cameras to get a depth map and blur the background.
It gives a sense of depth to your photos that usually only works with telescopic lenses on DSLRs. To be clear, this isn’t true blur; Apple is using software to reproduce this kind of effect you get on a camera.
Unfortunately, the feature didn’t make it in time for the release of iOS 10 last week. Apple only said that the feature was coming “later this year.” It turns out this feature could be available much sooner than expected as you can already play with it with today’s beta.
You can expect Apple to release a public beta as well on Friday in case you don’t have a developer account. And let’s hope the final version of iOS 10.1 will ship sooner rather than later.

474,Frederic Lardinois,"SkyGiraffe helps enterprises give their employees access to their line-of-business apps and enterprise data from virtually any device. The company today announced that it has raised a $6 million funding round led by SGVC, with participation from Trilogy Equity Partners and a number of angel investors, including Heroku founder and CEO James Lindenbaum, Lookout founder and CTO Kevin Mahaffey and Parse founder and CEO Ilya Sukhar.
SkyGiraffe does a couple of things. It helps businesses connect and aggregate data from their various on-premises and cloud-based applications and lets them build new apps or bring existing apps to iOS, Android and Windows. The company argues that its approach allows enterprises to bring their cross-platform development cycles down to a day, compared to the months it would take to develop custom apps for iOS and Android, for example.

The core of the service is the SkyGiraffe Integration server that can pull in data from most standard enterprise database systems, as well as applications like Salesforce and Workday. You then build your applications in the drag-and-drop interface of the SkyGiraffe Studio app and, depending on how you want to set up the system, you can then distribute those apps through a self-hosted distribution server behind your firewall, or use SkyGiraffe’s cloud services to distribute and manage the applications. SkyGiraffe also allows you to use its cloud services to integrate your data.
The kind of apps you would build with SkyGiraffe include standard line-of-business apps for your workflow (think managing time sheets or building an executive sales dashboard for the C-suite).
As the company also announced today, it now offers a REST endpoint that allows you to integrate third-party front-end applications like Slack, Office 365, Skype and Google Sheets. The code for this, including for SkyGiraffe’s Slack bot, is now available on GitHub. With this, developers now have a single API endpoint they can use to build on top of the company’s platform.
“Optimizing business processes in the mobile era depends on secure, scalable data access for applications,” said SkyGiraffe founder and CEO Boaz Hecht in today’s announcement. “SkyGiraffe’s platform provides customers with a competitive advantage in solving this issue to execute on their mobility strategies at unprecedented speed and scale.”
Today’s funding round brings SkyGiraffe’s total funding to $10.5 million. The company says it will use today’s funding round to “continue expanding the breadth and capabilities of its platform among other initiatives.”",2016-08-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-640431339.jpg?w=738,skygiraffe,SkyGiraffe raises $6M for its enterprise mobility platform
475,Anthony Ha,"“Identity-as-a-service” startup Auth0 (pronounced “auth zero”) has raised $15 million in Series B funding.
CEO Jon Gelsey said that for many website and mobile app developers, integrating with different login systems can turn into a big headache — and also create security risks. So the company helps those developers manage identity and authentication, whether that’s through social logins like Facebook and Twitter or through enterprise authentication systems.
“At the end of the day, we want to make the Internet safer,” Gelsey said. “The wonderful and terrible thing about identity is that it’s a very complex, heterogenous and corner-case-ridden area.”
Auth0 has now raised a total of $24 million. The new round was led by Trinity Ventures, with participation from previous investors Bessemer Venture Partners, K9 Ventures and Silicon Valley Bank.
“If you believe Marc Andreessen that software is eating the world — and I do — then authentication is the lynchpin,” said Trinity’s Karan Mehandru, who’s joining Auth0’s board of directors.
Mehandru also said that while other companies in the market focus on “silos” like social logins or two-factor authentication, Auth0 has “taken a very asymmetric approach with a very elegant solution, a single platform that’s intersecting with the developer even before they’ve delineated this problem into different areas.”

Gelsey added that an Auth0 customer might start out with a simple authentication system, then add more sophisticated security features over time.
And speaking of security features, Auth0 is announcing a new one — breached password detection, which allows businesses to notify their users when their password has been compromised on another website. Gelsey explained since people generally reuse their passwords across multiple sites, breached password detection allows developers to “mitigate [their] risk without forcing users to change their behavior.”",2016-08-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/auth0.jpg?w=738,"authentication,trinity-ventures,auth0",Authentication startup Auth0 raises $15M as it beefs up security features
476,Lora Kolodny,"A San Francisco-based startup called DroneDeploy has raised $20 million in Series B funding to grow their drone data management platform.
The drone tech startup closed its Series B deal just before the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is scheduled to implement new rules governing commercial and industrial drone use.
The Part 107 rules, announced by the FAA in June this year, will take hold next week, and have the potential to unleash a torrent of drones and drone-based services within different industries in the U.S. They clarify and simplify what it takes to use drones at work, legally, as long as the drones weigh 55 pounds or less.
Scale Venture Partners led the investment in DroneDeploy, joined by High Alpha, a fund started by ExactTarget co-founder Scott Dorsey. The funding brings the company’s total capital raised to $31 million to-date.
According to CEO Mike Winn, who co-founded DroneDeploy with Jono Millin and Nicholas Pilkington in 2013 via AngelPad, DroneDeploy will use the funding for hiring, product development, sales and marketing.
The CEO said DroneDeploy’s technology is already used in 130 countries and every imaginable industry. The platform allows users to plan flights, pilot drones either one at a time or in fleet formations, and gather and analyze myriad data types to create detailed maps and 3-D models.
DroneDeploy has been used to help investigators identify shallow graves where criminals may have dumped their murder victims, to fly over plane crash sites gathering images from overhead where human inspectors couldn’t safely maneuver, and to gauge the volume of waste in a landfill day by day, among other things, Winn said.
More commonly, DroneDeploy is used in agriculture to survey arable land, and monitor crop health; map conditions on the ground and progress on projects for builders and construction businesses; or to conduct roof inspections for insurance companies and real estate developers.
 
DroneDeploy’s software as a service has been used to map more than 5 million acres of land internationally thus far.
Scale Venture Partners’ Rory O’Driscoll will take a board seat at DroneDeploy, given his firm’s investment. O’Driscoll, who also holds board seats at DocuSign and Box, drew a comparison between DroneDeploy and SaaS ventures that grew successful long before drones were commonly used outside of defense.
“DroneDeploy’s software can enable anyone from the smallest business to the largest corporation in the world to get commercial value out of drones. We’ve seen the model succeed where you have a free product for individuals and small business owners, but can say to large, commercial companies who use this here is an enterprise version, if you pay us more you will get more,” the investor said.
O’Driscoll said he expects DroneDeploy to use the funding to grow its inside and outside sales teams, possibly move into larger offices, and continue to expand their product so that it becomes the “no-brainer choice” for any business operating a drone commercially.
That will mean adding more access and controls for large teams, Winn suggested.
The company’s long-term goal is to make unmanned aerial vehicles, and the data that they gather, useful for any business. But DroneDeploy’s technology has the potential to be used in conjunction with autonomous robots on the ground, too.",2016-08-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/dronedeploy_elevation_map_example.png?w=738,"mapping,drones,saas",DroneDeploy raises $20 million to help any business put drones to work
477,Lucia Maffei,"Tableau Software‘s shares soared 13 percent on Tuesday following the news that it has appointed a new CEO and the announcement that the data analytics provider has partnered with Narrative Science, a Chicago-based company that develops natural language generation (NLG) tools. The result of the partnership is Narratives for Tableau, a free Chrome extension that automatically creates written explanations for Tableau graphics.
Let’s say, for example, that you have a chart — made with Tableau — of sales and profits of your business for a certain amount of time. The extension, which works with Tableau Server 10.0 or the free Tableau Public service, will generate a narrative description of the data by writing sentences such as “Sales and profit ratio moved in opposite directions from January 2011 to December 2014,” as shown in this example.
“This extension was built from an extremely close collaboration between Tableau and Narrative Science,” Stuart Frankel, CEO of Narrative Science, wrote in an email to TechCrunch. “While sitting outside the platform, the UI and experience feel similar to the Tableau experience.”
Narrative Science is best known for Quill, a platform that can take data — say, sports scores — and turn them into stories. Narratives for Tableau is one example of applying Quill’s capabilities, Frankel pointed out.
In an email to TechCrunch, Francois Ajenstat, chief product officer of Tableau, said the company did not provide funding for this project. “We’re planning to release similar extensions with other leaders in the market down the road,” Ajenstat added.

Once Narratives for Tableau has generated the text, users can customize it by choosing a paragraph- or bullet point-style for the description, among other things. If users are not satisfied with the results, they can also make changes to the text.
“Within the settings modal, users can add context about the data and turn on and off analytic packages to change narratives,” Frankel wrote. “In addition, users can copy and paste outputs from visualizations and narratives into external documents and make changes to the text.” Then, users can embed both narratives and interactive visualizations in a web page.
The Chrome extension is a public preview that serves as a first step toward more deeply integrating advanced NLG into Tableau. Currently, Narratives for Tableau only works in Chrome. “That said, we are working with Tableau to determine the next steps for the development of the product including other methods of deployment,” Frankel wrote.
The partnership between Tableau and Narrative Science was made public around 24 hours after the announcement that Tableau had appointed Adam Selipsky as president and CEO, effective September 16. Christian Chabot, Tableau’s co-founder and current CEO, will continue to serve as chairman of the board of directors.
At the beginning of August, Tableau’s 2Q earnings fell short of estimates because of higher than expected expenses for the quarter. In New York Stock Exchange trading today, Tableau closed up $7.35, or 13.4 percent, at $62.22.

478,Frederic Lardinois,"NGINX, the company behind the popular open-source NGINX server, launched the latest version (R10) of its NGINX Plus commercial offering today. Like similar open-source companies, NGINX offers its core product for free, but then charges for more advanced features and services.
Today marks the tenth major update to NGINX Plus and, as the company’s CMO Peter Guagenti and technical product marketer Faisal Memon told me, the focus of this release is squarely on adding new security features to the product. “This is the culmination of some work we’ve been putting in over the last year based on feedback from our larger enterprise customers,” Guagenti told me. He noted how NGINX has long offered some security features are part of its existing solution to, for example, help mitigate DDoS attacks.
Now, however, NGINX has integrated ModSecurity, a popular open-source web application firewall (WAF) that will also allow it to offer its paying users more advanced security tools like IP blacklisting and the ability to create application-specific rules for protecting applications.
Memon tells me that the team looked at other solutions but settled on ModSecurity because it’s actively maintained and because many of the enterprises the team talked to were already familiar with it.
Adding support for ModSecurity to an existing NGINX Plus subscription isn’t free, though, and will cost an additional $2,000 per year on top of the base fee.
Other new features in this release include support for JSON Web Tokens and dual-stack ECC-RSA certificates. Both of these features may not sound all that exciting, but the support for tokens will make adding support for single-sign-on solutions easier, for example, while ECC certificates essentially represent the next generation of the RSA standard for public-key cryptography. To provide support for legacy applications, though, these kind of dual-stack solutions remain necessary.
NGINX Plus R10 is also the first release to offer the company’s commercial users a preview of nginScript, the company’s new JavaScript-based configuration and control service. Because it allows admins to use JavaScript, admins can not just create static configurations, for example, but also can create them programmatically.",2016-08-23,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/r10-blog-modsecurity-ddos.jpg?w=738,nginx,NGINX Plus’s latest release puts the focus on security
479,Fitz Tepper,"As entertaining and interesting as made-for-TV lawsuits (like the O.J trial) are, they always leave out one key element. The hundreds of hours of research that goes on behind the scenes to prepare for an important trial.
Before any big trial a lawyer (and their associates and interns) has to find, organize and examine thousands of documents. The process is officially called Discovery, and is a period when both sides gather and request all the information they think they will need for the trial.
This information can look like anything from email databases to Powerpoints, and while some of the process has become computerized in recent years (aptly termed eDiscovery), it’s still remained pretty manual and inefficient.
For example, eDiscovery may mean a team of associates combing through hundreds of pages of email correspondence on a screen, instead of printing it all out like lawyers used to do. A win for the environment yes, but still very, very time consuming and not really taking advantage of technology.
But Logikcull is a software company trying to change this, and just closed $10M in Series A funding from OpenView Ventures and Storm Ventures to help.
The company officially calls itself “cloud-based legal intelligence”, but is essentially Dropbox for the legal world.
Lawyers can bulk-upload all the messy information they need to examine (even if it’s an entire hard drive of different types of files) and Logikcull will organize all the different file types into one searchable database.
Need an example? Imagine uploading 1,000 pages of old contracts, then using a search engine to find the exact ones that are relevant to the case. Or uploading a 20 GB email database of tens of thousands of messages and narrowing it down to only the messages between people relevant in your case on a certain date from a certain device – you get the point.
Logikcull also uses OCR so you can upload old scanned documents that weren’t previously searchable.
While originally designed for (and still mostly used by) lawyers, these tools obviously have applications in other industries. A company’s HR department could use it to sort through the thousands of documents typically involved in an internal investigation. Or a city could use it to quickly find documents related to specific FOIA requests, a process that is still sometimes done by hand. Letting a government employee quickly find the specific documents that were requested can turn a one month turnaround time for FOIA requests into just a few days.
Essentially, the platform can be used for any task that requires you to organize and search a crazy amount of documents.
The company charges per user, and a small law firm can expect to pay $15k-$30k per year. Expensive yes, but not if the alternative is paying hundreds of extra hours in legal fees at $600 per hour.
Logikcull says they are signing up new clients at a rate that has grown revenues 3x year-over-year, which is impressive considering how expensive the service. But that’s the thing about legal tech – the alternative is so crazy expensive that startups can charge an arm and a leg as long as they are providing a solution that actually save time.",2016-08-23,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-129301233.jpg?w=738,"lawyer,documents,legal-technology,legal-tech",Logikcull raises $10M to let lawyers analyze documents at the speed of a thousand interns
480,Natasha Lomas,"Microsoft has picked up another productivity app — announcing the acquisition of AI-powered scheduling tool Genee. In a blog post today the software giant said it will be plugging Genee into its cloud productivity suite, Office 365. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
“As we continue to build new Office 365 productivity capabilities and services our customers value, I’m confident the Genee team will help us further our ambition to bring intelligence into every digital experience,” writes Rajesh Jha, CVP of Outlook and Office 365.
Genee launched in public beta a year ago, offering an end-to-end scheduling tool that integrates with calendar apps and email providers to take the strain out of arranging meetings.
The app works by being CCed in emails, and using natural language processing to parse the contents of the email to understand the key requirements for the meeting — and then automatically sending out a meeting invite on your behalf. So it’s arguably an early example of the AI-powered chatbots now springing up all over the place. There are a set of standard commands Genee understands by default but users can also create their own custom commands.
Microsoft notes the tool is “especially useful for large groups for when you don’t have access to someone’s calendar”. Genee’s co-founders, Ben Cheung and Charles Lee, “plan” to join the company, it adds.
In their own blog post on the acquisition the co-founders write: “We consider Microsoft to be the leader in personal and enterprise productivity, AI, and virtual assistant technologies, so we look forward to bringing our passion and expertise to a team that is committed to delivering cutting-edge language and intelligence services.”
They also note the Genee app will shut down on September 1 (although all existing calendar entries created with it will remain, as you’d hope) — as was also the case with another recent Microsoft productivity app acquisition, the Sunrise calendar.
Productivity and productivity apps remains a big focus for Microsoft as it continues to grapple with a mobile landscape dominated by other tech giant’s OSes.

Along with the new round, Wayne Jackson, CEO of Sonatype and former CEO of Sourcefire, will join the company’s Board of Directors. He will serve alongside BVP Partner David Cowan who co-founded cyber security companies VeriSign, Good Technology and Defense.net, and Authentic8 CEO Scott Petry, who founded the email security company Postini.
Launched back in 2014, Virtru was founded by brothers John and Will Ackerly, both with a tech background in the government sector. Will, in fact, was a cloud security engineer with the NSA while John advised the White House on technology issues, including digital privacy, before leaving for private equity.

The two had the idea to bring security and privacy to the applications people use every day – but in a way that made it easier to implement for the everyday user. The first product to debut was a Chrome and Firefox extension that integrated with popular email services like Gmail, which allowed users to secure their email with end-to-end encryption and specify how long the email could remain in someone’s inbox before being automatically deleted, or whether email forwarding was permitted.
Since then, the company has brought its encryption, access control and data loss prevention (DLP) tools to services like Gmail, Google Drive, Yahoo, and Outlook (2010, 2013, 2016). It also has its own, standalone email apps available on Google Play and the iTunes App Store With the funding, it will work on expanding to other cloud platforms, such as Microsoft Office 365. It will also further develop its SDKs and APIs so software developers can integrate Virtru into their own applications.

Virtru’s Encryption-as-a-Service architecture is built on the Trusted Data Format (TDF), an open-source technology built by Will, which wraps each content object in its own secure envelope that can only be accessed by the authorized parties. Customers manage their own encryption keys and can revoke others’ privileges and access at any time, even after the data is open or shared.
This year, the company has also rolled out other features, including encrypted search for searching encrypted content in an email or file; hardware-based encryption keys; and it debuted its SDK.
What makes the technology interesting and notable is not that it’s necessarily the most secure – John admitted before that there are more secure means of online communication – but those tend to be hard to use and expensive. Instead, Virtru is simple enough for anyone to understand, and it works across different platforms. And it’s free for personal use, with tiered pricing for Pro ($5/month) and Enterprise use.

 
While the inspiration for the product was on simplifying security for everyone, Virtru is now used by businesses, in addition to individuals. Its software makes it simpler for businesses to manage security and encryption in Gmail, Google Drive and Google Apps, and helps businesses with things like CJIS, CFPB and HIPAA compliance as well as IP Protection, among other things. Today, it touts customers in the media, entertainment, government, healthcare, financial services, and manufacturing sectors.
The funding is notable giving the crunch affecting startups’ ability to raise – especially in the crowded cybersecurity sector, which was cited earlier this year as seeing a funding “drought.” BVP’s Cowan said at the time that many startups arriving on the scene were copying technology on the market already, or were launching products hackers had already figured out how to circumvent. The challenges led to startups taking longer to close deals, having to cut spending, or looking for exits. For the time being, however, Virtru does not appear to be in that bucket.
“As we share our personal information with banks, doctors, schools, employers, and governments, our individual privacy depends upon their security,” said Cowan, in a statement. “The success of Virtru’s email and file protection offerings show that they’re setting the new standard for business privacy.”",2016-08-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-493602229.jpg?w=738,"encryption,email,virtru","Email and file encryption service Virtru, built by ex-NSA engineer, raises $29 million"
482,John Mannes,"The flow of Chinese capital into foreign ad-tech companies increased this morning with the acquisition of Media.net for $900 million USD. A consortium will be paying cash for the startup with key operation centers in New York City and Dubai. Eventually the company is set to be acquired from the consortium by Miteno Communication Technology, a Chinese tech conglomerate. The transaction is one of the largest ad-tech deals in history, ahead of notable exits like Google’s $750 million dollar acquisition of AdMob in 2010 and Twitter’s $350 million dollar acquisition of MoPub in 2013.
Media.net provides a suite of products for creating, targeting, and evaluating advertising campaigns. The company supports publishers by connecting them to relevant ads via their Yahoo! Bing network. Media.net’s publisher inventory is available through major demand-side platforms and ad-exchanges.
The Chinese ad-tech space is particularly interesting because API integration with many of the largest Chinese technology companies lags behind their American counterparts. This is putting pressure on companies to find innovative ways to target advertising.
To bolster innovation in sectors like e-Commerce, the Chinese State Council released guidance back in 2015 effectively advocating for investment in the ad-tech space.
“To promote e-business application innovation — Enhance precision marketing capabilities, to stimulate consumer demand in the market.”
All of this contextualizes other ad-tech acquisitions by Chinese firms that have occurred this year despite a downturn in U.S. ad-tech M&A activity. In February, mobile ad-tech startup NativeX was grabbed up by Chinese ad-network Mobvista for $24.5 million. Just four months later, Beijing-based Spearhead Integrated Marketing Communication Group paid $148 million for Smaato, another mobile advertising company.
“I should have [entered China] three years ago,” said Divyank Turakhia, CEO and founder of Media.net. “I’m late, I just didn’t realize I was this late.”
This isn’t to say that Turakhia made a mistake, he will still be walking away from the deal as a newly minted billionaire, while remaining in control of his company.
Divyank, and his brother Bhavin, run a variety of businesses including the Directi Group and Skenzo, a part of Media.net. Skenzo takes a different approach to traffic monetization by focusing on parked domains. Essentially this is a method of making money off registered domains that have not been linked to a developed website by targeting individuals who may have made an error in entering the web-address for highly trafficked sites.
Turakhia said his company was not in a hurry to sell, and is growing and profitable. Yet, in thinking about the future of the company, he hired bankers to investigate a possible transaction and got back a lot of interest. Media.net received seven bids in the final round and more in earlier rounds with final bids only differing by 10-30 percent, according to Turakhia.
Back in 2014, Ashmore Investment Management Limited held a stake in Media.net. An Ashmore mid-year report from the same year cited Media.net as a struggling investment and ultimately included the following statement:
“The Company’s stake in Media.net was marked down by 39% due to deteriorating
operating performance and limited diversification of revenues which depressed
the multiple at which its earnings are valued.”
Of course, just two months later, Directi would end up buying those shares back. Media.net was the sole company out of 11 total, started by the brothers, that received outside investment.
The company’s Yahoo Bing Contextual Ads have been a significant revenue stream for the company, and as of the close of this deal, 90 percent of Media.net’s revenue is concentrated in the U.S. market. Zhiyong Zhang, the chairman of Beijing Miteno Communication Technology Co. Ltd, made a point to note that Miteno can strengthen Media.net by means of “capital support” towards global growth.
The Chinese market inherently presents a challenge for the foreign company. Mr. Zhang hinted at a potential strategic data play for the company trying to find a foothold in a market dominated by mobile devices.
Turakhia is bullish on diversification and the potential for up-selling that comes from a single vendor offering multiple products. Besides expanding throughout Asia, Turakhia wants to double down on video and focus more on mobile apps. He is also looking to forge additional partnerships and expand technology licensing to DSPs and SSPs.
The deal has already closed and will be paid out in all cash. However, the first $426 million will be paid immediately from the consortium, while another $474 million will be coming as part of an agreed upon payment schedule. It is worth nothing that Miteno shares have been frozen on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange for the last eight months.
“The primary reason for the acquisition was not [Media.net’s] high profit, but more of the management team and the technology staff,” said Mr.Zhang.
While the transaction is not an acquihire, Mr. Zhang connects a lot of Media.net’s value to Turakhia’s leadership. Turakhia is famous for his daredevil approach to life and business. He started his first company at at age 14 and made his first million at 18. Today, he performs aerial acrobatics for fun — but if that’s an average day off, we would love to know how he plans to celebrate joining the three commas club.",2016-08-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-106346637.jpg?w=738,"directi,internet-marketing,internet-advertising,world-wide-web",Media.net acquired for $900M in mega ad-tech deal
483,Sarah Perez,"Amazon is rolling out a new way for businesses to use its cloud-based virtual desktop service, Amazon WorkSpaces. Instead of paying monthly for access to an always-on WorkSpace you can connect to at any time, companies can now choose to pay and use WorkSpaces on an hourly basis. The new billing system is designed to appeal to those businesses with part-time employees, traveling employees who only log in sporadically, those working on short-term projects, and more.
Launched publicly in 2014 following its debut at the AWS re:Invent conference, Amazon WorkSpaces is Amazon’s secure desktop computing service that runs on the AWS cloud. The WorkSpaces provide end users with access to documents, applications and other resources, and can be used from any supported device, including Windows and Mac computers, Chromebooks, iPads, Fire tablets and Android tablets.
Businesses can deploy the WorkSpaces to employees, already preconfigured with the apps, files, and access they need for their job, and they’re able to integrate with Active Directory for user authentication and WorkSpace management.

Previously, however, access to WorkSpaces was sold through a competitive, but traditional pricing structure. The pricing varies depending on your region, the hardware resources you require, and whether you want some basic applications pre-loaded, like Microsoft Office and other utilities. That means the monthly pricing ranges from $21 to $60 (U.S.) before add-ons.
With the new hourly plans – dubbed “AutoStop,” versus the monthly plan’s “AlwaysOn” service – WorkSpaces start running and billing when the user logs in. They will then stop automatically when the user is disconnected for a specific period of time. You can select a time from 1 to 48 hours before the system is disconnected, says Amazon.
WorkSpaces admins can also force a WorkSpace to stop running, if need be. When the user returns, their WorkSpace will remain intact with all their documents still open and running programs available as before. Resuming the WorkSpace takes under 90 seconds.
In addition to news of the hourly billing, Amazon also responded to customer feedback and expanded the size of the root volume for new WorkSpaces to 80 GB, which allows for more applications, and more data to be stored at no extra cost. (Existing WorkSpaces will have to be rebuilt to upgrade them to the larger root volumes.)
Hourly pricing still has a small monthly fee, in addition to the cents per hour you rent your WorkSpace. The “Value” bundle starts at $0.22/hour, or $0.17/hour with the “BYOL” (Bring Your Own License) option, and costs $7.25/per month. This gives you 1 vCPU, 2 GiB memory, and 10 GB for user storage. This pricing option makes sense for those employees who work less than half-time, as it’s only $25/month for the always-on service.",2016-08-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/amazon_workspaces.png?w=738,amazon-workspaces,"Amazon now lets you rent its virtual desktops, Amazon WorkSpaces, by the hour"
484,Lucia Maffei,"The range of benefits that Silicon Valley companies offer employees may vary from dental, vision and 401(k) all the way to yoga massages, car washes and beauty services. With tech giants like Facebook and Google making a big deal about the benefits they offer, delivering and managing perks is a key part of any company’s strategy to attract talent now — and this is where Espresa comes into the picture.
Founded in June 2015, the Palo Alto-based startup developed an online platform that allows companies to provide workplace services for employees. The company, which has 20 employees, has raised $2 million in seed funding from Crosslink Capital, Clear Ventures, TEC Ventures and angel investors.
Let’s say, for example, that you’re an employee at a company that uses Espresa and you have a cracked screen on your phone. By logging into the Espresa app via web or mobile, you can select a phone repair service and a vendor will come to fix it.
“Some of the services, like cell phone repair, are truly on-demand,” Alex Shubat, CEO and co-founder of Espresa, said in a phone interview with TechCrunch. “Some other services work on a schedule. Car wash, for example, may be available at the company on Thursday, so employees can book their slot.”
The list of services that Espresa offers includes car washes, car refuels and general repairs, haircuts, manicures, eyebrow treatments, bicycle repair and team-building opportunities. Among all the options, phone repair is becoming very popular, Shubat said. Typically, users are able to get the service within 24-48 hours.

Shubat said he got the idea for Espresa when he was an investor and an advisor at Odysee, a company that was acquired by Google in February 2015. During the celebration dinner, he heard the CEO and co-founder of Odysee, Raghavan Menon (who’s now a co-founder of Espresa), talking about how well Google treats its employees. “They can get a massage, they can get a car wash, they can get a haircut and things like that,” Shubat said. “So I started doing research in this area.”
The name of the company is a play after the word “express.” “It just sounded nice. Later on we found out that it is actually in the Spanish dictionary,” Shubat commented.
To deploy the platform, companies must pay a subscription fee, which depends on the company size (between $1 and $2 per employee each month). Espresa also collects a commission from every transaction vendors make thanks to the platform. For vendors, joining the platform is free.
Who pays for each service depends on what the company would like to do. Once the company deploys Espresa, it has to decide which services are subsidized. Services can be 100 percent funded by the company, costs can be shared 50-50 between company and employee or the employee can pay 100 percent. Another option for the company is providing employees with $100 (or more) a month and letting them decide how to spend it on the platform. “The platform can take care of both models,” Shubat said.
Espresa currently works with about 50 vendors that have all been selected by the company’s Vendor Curation and Management Team. “They’re looking for vendors based on companies’ requests, or vendors are soliciting us,” Shubat explained. “Once we decide to work with a vendor, we verify the quality of service. We check their reviews and we make sure they have all the paperwork, like insurance and proper background check. Only after they’ve passed the Espresa Pre-Check program, we allow them to enter the platform.”
Employees who uses Espresa may also leave feedback about the services they used. By signing a contract with Espresa, vendors commit to maintaining a certain quality level.
Espresa competes with companies like AnyPerk, which provides a platform to let companies deliver discounts to their employees. Last year, AnyPerk raised $8.5 million in new funding. “But they don’t focus on bringing providers to the workplace,” Shubat said.
Currently, Espresa is used by 25,000 employees in about 15 companies. The platform is only available in the Bay Area, but the company plans to expand next year, likely to Austin, LA and San Diego.",2016-08-18,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/espresa.png?w=738,"espresa,anyperk",Espresa wants to help companies pamper their employees
485,Frederic Lardinois,"IT monitoring specialist ScienceLogic today announced that it has acquired AppFirst, a service to give IT admins deeper visibility in what apps and services run across a company’s servers, virtual machines and cloud instances. The companies did not disclose the financial details of the transaction.
Minnesota-based AppFirst was founded in 2009 and raised a total of $15.2 million, including two debt rounds in 2014 and 2015.
As ScienceLogic COO Mike Denning told me, the two companies were already talking about forming a business relationship, but those conversations then quickly moved toward a discussion about an acquisition. He also noted that for AppFirst, the options were to either raise a lot of money in what is currently a bit of a challenging environment or go for an acquisition. AppFirst’s CEO won’t join ScienceLogic, but its CTO, Donn Rochette, will.
ScienceLogic itself already offered its users deep insights into their infrastructure, but more and more, its users were also asking to get real-time data about their full stack, up to the application level. “We want to give you a single pane of glass to monitor your IT infrastructure,” Denning said. “But now our customers want us to come further up the stack into the application.” That’s especially true as more enterprises start experimenting with microservice-based solutions and software containers (and occasionally use them in production, too).
ScienceLogic looked at building those capabilities itself, but, in the end, it decided that the market was changing very quickly and it wanted to be able to offer the kind of capabilities its customers were asking for as soon as possible. Denning noted that AppFirst also has a number of patents around the architecture of its agents. With the acquisition, he believes, ScienceLogic can now build these tools in six months instead of 18-24 months.
As Denning told me, the more data ScienceLogic can get, the better it can serve its users. For now, it’s integrating AppFirst’s data collection technology into its own service. Then the plan is to also use AppFirst’s expertise to gather more log data and then, shortly after that, to add support for microservices and Docker containers. “The more data sources we have, the larger our addressable market,” Denning said, and added that this acquisition will now help the company better understand the application market.
ScienceLogic, which now has just under 400 employees, will keep AppFirst’s office in Minnesota open and has made offers to all of the company’s employees.",2016-08-18,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-475158195.jpg?w=738,"system-administration,network-management,appfirst,sciencelogic",ScienceLogic acquires AppFirst to bolster its IT infrastructure monitoring service
486,Ron Miller,"Redbooth, makers of project management and collaboration software, announced a new Apple TV app today that brings their service directly to Apple TV.
We mostly think of Apple TV as a consumer device, designed to give us access to entertainment and games or to project the contents of one of our Apple devices onto a bigger screen. That changed to some extent last year when Apple announced the Apple TV App Store, and opened the door to the possibility of enterprise apps for the device.
While it was possible to use Redbooth (or any enterprise app) on Apple TV using the screen-sharing feature, this gives native access without any fussing.
“As a collaboration app designed specifically for Apple TV, we’re delivering a groundbreaking, streamlined experience that allows you to skip the screen-sharing, ditch the dongles and start planning quickly and beautifully in the living room or the board room,” Redbooth CEO Dan Schoenbaum explained in a statement.
The Redbooth Apple TV app has a few features designed to take advantage of being on the Apple device. First of all, it’s been optimized for a larger screen. Once you log in, you get access to all of your projects and tasks, just as you would on the desktop or mobile versions of the product. There’s also some additional content including training, best practices and productivity tips — all available from the app.
The Redbooth for Apple TV app is available today in the Apple TV App Store.
While the Redbooth product can be used for business for conducting online meetings and project planning, it can also be used for projects with a more consumer focus such as planning a wedding or a trip.

487,Frederic Lardinois,"In Atlassian‘s view, video is the next battlefield in the enterprise chat wars (a war it is mostly fighting with Slack, it seems). Its HipChat group messaging app launched one-on-one video chats back in 2014, but today, it is pushing this further by launching group video chats, as well.
To enable this, Atlassian built a new video platform based on its acquisition of BlueJimp and that company’s Videobridge appliance and Jitsi WebRTC-based open source video conferencing software. When Atlassian acquired BlueJimp, it already said that it did so to bring group video chats to HipChat, so today’s news doesn’t come as a complete surprise. What may be surprising, though, is that Slack doesn’t offer a similar tool yet.
As Atlassian’s GM of HipChat Steve Goldsmith told me, the idea here was to bridge the gap between team chat apps and video conferencing service. Too often, after all, those video services only introduce new layers of complexity and friction, which in turn makes it less likely for team members to want to use them (let alone set up a spur-of-the-moment video chat).
Goldsmith also noted that the technical integration of the feature was pretty easy because the team was able to build on years of experience thanks to the BlueJimp acquisition (what was harder, he said, was building the actual user experience around it).
With this new feature, all it takes is a click to start a video call with up to 10 people. That’s not a huge group, but Goldsmith argued that this isn’t a technical limit (which is much higher). Instead, Goldsmith argued that he thinks 10 is about the maximum number of participants for a video chat to still work effectively. The HipChat team plans to listen to its users, though, and then maybe loosen that restriction over time.
You can, by the way, also bring in people from outside of your HipChat rooms (and your company), too. They will simply get a link to click on, just like with other video chat services. Just like similar video chat services, HipChat will automatically feature in the main window whoever is currently speaking.
To enable this feature, HipChat set up servers running its customized version of Jitsi in its data centers around the world.
We know that Slack plans to launch video chats soon, too, but we don’t know when it plans to actually start testing it. As for HipChat, the new feature is now available to all paying users.",2016-08-18,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/hipchat_group_video.png?w=738,"atlassian,hipchat,instant-messaging,web-applications",Atlassian’s HipChat gets group video chats
488,Matthew Lynley,"We caught wind earlier this week that Cisco was planning a major cost-cutting operation to reduce its costs by around 15% throughout the month. It looks like the first stage of that is a round of cut jobs, with Cisco announcing as part of its earnings report that it will cut up to 5,500 jobs, or 7% of its workforce.
The move isn’t unexpected as Cisco works to transition to a new era where it can’t simply focus on only building its core networking hardware. The company has been aggressively spending on acquisitions since the beginning of last year, including paying $1.4 billion most recently for Jasper Technologies in a move into managing Internet of Things devices.
“Today, we announced a restructuring enabling us to optimize our cost base in lower growth areas of our portfolio and further invest in key priority areas such as security, IoT, collaboration, next generation data center and cloud,” the company said in a statement. “We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these actions back into these businesses and will continue to aggressively invest to focus on our areas of future growth.”
An acquisition like Jasper Technologies is as much a signal in its move to considering a new phase of networking technology, which is its core competency. But the idea of how devices are networked is certainly changing over time, including as the diversity of devices that require some kind of networking continues to expand.

Big rounds of layoffs like this are common as companies look to find new footing in times of transition. Microsoft experienced this in full force as it has laid off a lot of employees under the new leadership of Satya Nadella. It’s not just a question of bringing in new blood and fresh eyes in the form of hires and acquisitions, it’s about rejiggering the structure of the company to promote new ideas and spur innovation — and sometimes that means that roles simply vanish into the ether as things get more streamlined.
All this seemed expected — though the final number came in lower than the reported up to 14,000 expected cuts — as investors barely blinked in extended trading, with Cisco’s stock only falling 1%. The job cuts will start in the first quarter of its next fiscal year.",2016-08-17,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-120787072.jpg?w=738,"earnings,cisco","Cisco confirms it will cut up to 5,500 jobs, or 7% of its global workforce"
489,Matthew Lynley,"Mathias Biilmann — a former CTO of a firm that built websites for small businesses — says developers have gotten so used to using Github as a central workflow, they expect the entire rest of the developer experience to work the same way.
“The way that a front-end developer would work would be to go into a server and change how things were structured, but then Git came in and became the basic way of operating,” Biilmann, co-founder of Netlify, said. “You get more and more the expectation that pushing to Git something happens.”
That’s his goal for his and his co-founder Chris Bach’s new company. Netlify basically initiates its own kind of repository that pushes both to a Github repository and its own services. Then, those updates execute and are distributed across a wide network of content delivery networks to deliver pre-built static pages to visitors — with Netlify picking the best one from the cloud services available. Netlify then distributes all those static sites across its own content delivery network, meaning that when visitors access those pages they are pre-built.
The idea here is that, instead of a program running every time a visitor goes to a page, the pre-loading has already been done and the user is immediately served a page that’s directed from the closest geographic server, in order to reduce load times. More dynamically built pages may also be vulnerable to slowdowns if they suddenly get a spike of traffic, Biilmann said.
The hope is that, by simplifying the deployment process, he can convince developers that are looking for a lightweight page experience to use something like Netlify instead of simply deploying directly to Amazon Web Services or other providers. To do all this, the company has raised $2.1 million from Bloomberg Beta and Tank Hill Ventures.
Part of the process that’s developed over time is simply pushing Git updates directly to a server, like AWS. The expectation over time has become to simply run a push update through a command line and expect it to work on the other end. Since this has become an increasing expectation over time, especially with front-end developers, Biilmann and his team decided to build a set of tools that bundled together all the necessary components of building out those pages and deploying them.
So, Netlify enables those developers to roll out changes across a larger network of servers that can easily be rolled back with those kinds of simple updates. And all this can be done directly from a command line interface.

So, why pre-built? There are a few reasons: sometimes, when visiting a site, the page will build dynamically based on the applications running on something like Amazon Web Services. That not only requires the page to build itself, but also leaves open the opportunity for malicious attacks (like finding a vulnerability in a Flask server, for example). By essentially pushing the site in isolation from a CDN, they aren’t tapping into a dynamic setup that might be open to attack.

If a developer ends up breaking a line of code, they can quickly roll back to a previous instance of the site that’s out there. While most of the operations can be done from a command line interface, Netlify users can also view a snapshot of their running pages through a web-based interface and monitor their health.
At the moment Netlify doesn’t serve tools that interact with a database layer. Biilmann says this is primarily because many modern pages implement an experience that’s hooked through a set of APIs into other services. One example he gave would be running comments through an API like Disqus, or running search functions through another API.
Investors in Netlify include Heroku founder Adam Wiggins and Github founder Tom Preston-Werner, who clearly seem to have an interest in helping individuals deploy fuller — and faster — website experiences with a simpler developer experience.
The challenge for Netlify will to keep those experiences simple and quickly adjust to developer demands for these kinds of tools. It’s not much of a stretch to imagine something like AWS implementing a similar tool, and with so many developers already running on AWS, it might be hard to peel them away. But Biilmann says that, while larger companies have enjoyed the capability to deploy these kinds of experiences, tools like these will help attract a wider long tail or developer activity.",2016-08-17,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/frame-concept.png?w=738,bloomberg-beta,"Netlify, a service for quickly rolling out static websites, raises $2.1M"
490,"Ron Miller,Ingrid Lunden","Sources are telling TechCrunch that Cisco is planning a significant cost reduction this week, which could involve budget cuts and layoffs.
We’ve been hearing that the reductions will be announced on August 17th or 18th and that they will be a part of a push to cut costs by 15 percent, with managers given some flexibility around how they implement this.
“A cost reduction of 15% that will include layoffs” is how one source described it. “Managers either cut costs or cut people.”
The rumors of cuts are clearly making the rounds: Trade magazine CRN yesterday reported layoffs of up to 14,000, and by our 15 percent number the figure might be more like 10,000. Cisco currently has around 72,000 employees worldwide.
A Cisco spokesperson told us that the company is in a quiet period prior to announcing their fourth quarter earnings this week, and would not comment regardless on rumor or speculation. Notably the company has used its August earnings to announce layoffs before — some 5 percent downsized last year, for example.
Cisco, like so many traditional IT companies has been in transition for some time. Since the beginning of 2015, it has made 16 acquisitions, an incredibly high level of activity, as it tries to use its cash on hand to help it pivot from its core network hardware business to a software and services business with a concentration on cloud, security and Internet of Things (IoT).
Cisco has no shortage of cash to buy companies to make that move with $63.5 billion cash on hand according to YCharts.
 
 
That money is also helping them take disruptive startups off the market and bring them in the fold. As an example, Cisco spent $1.4 billion earlier this year to buy Jasper Technologies, in a nod toward helping companies manage Internet of Things in the cloud.
As its core networking market becomes increasingly commoditized, moves like this allow Cisco to move into the more lucrative software market, while still playing to its networking strengths.
“The battle in IOT is ultimately about the network. Sensors, stacks and platforms will be commoditized in the network. But you need them for the foundation in the network. It’s a very smart and calculated move by Cisco,” R Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst at Constellation Research told TechCrunch at the time of the Jasper purchase.
But as companies go through these transitions, it’s not necessarily smooth ride. It requires new skill sets. People who designed, built, marketed and sold the networking stuff might not be needed in the next version of Cisco.
As it transitions, as we’ve seen with IBM, Intel and Microsoft, there are going to be waves of job reductions as they retool for what comes next. That’s probably not much of a consolation for the folks who end up losing their jobs, but it’s a harsh reality as the shift takes place. The good news is there will be a big market for newer skill sets, and folks who have those skills should be in demand.

491,"Josh Constine,Sarah Perez","Facebook today filled the biggest hole in its chatbot platform. Messenger bots can accept payments natively without sending users to an external website, Facebook’s head of Messenger David Marcus announced today onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016.
Finally, the credit card info people already have stored in Facebook or Messenger can be used to instantly make purchases in bots that are part of the new closed beta the developers can apply for. Marcus also revealed that 34,000 devs have joined the platform and built 30,000 bots in the April launch, up from over 10,000 devs in May and 11,000 bots in July.
To support payments in Messenger, Marcus says that the company is working with all the major players in the industry including Stripe, PayPal, Braintree, Visa, MasterCard and American Express — not just Stripe and PayPal which the Facebook developer blog post mentioned.
During the talk, Marcus discussed Messenger’s rise to 1 billion users thanks to a forced migration from Facebook’s main app, his relationship with Mark Zuckerberg, and the early stumbles with chatbots that have been used by millions of people across 200 countries.
In an effort to show Facebook’s commitment to its platform for bots, Marcus announced that all types of News Feed ads can point to them and users can share bots they enjoy with their friends. And instead of forcing all bot interactions to happen through text, developers can now build web views into conversations to pull in interfaces from their websites. This way you could scroll a list of flights, consume different types of media, or even play basic games while still in the chat window.
This is all part of the Messenger platform v1.2 that launched today. “Inside a thread you have identity, transaction capabilities, the ability to draw UI, and draw native buttons and interfaces,” Marcus explained. “We’re bring all these types of experiences together.”
He noted also that the webview could be prefetched to be very fast, which one of many under the hood performance improvements the app has seen in recent months to improve the startup time on mobile, and other latency issues.
All these changes will help to make Facebook Messenger bots better live up to the promise of the platform, which Marcus admitted was perhaps a bit undercooked at launch.
“The problem was it got really overhyped, very, very quickly,” he said. “The basic capabilities we provided at the time weren’t good enough to basically replace traditional app interfaces and experiences,” he said.
Because developers weren’t really given enough time or resources to build their bots before the platform went live, many early adopters felt that bots weren’t significantly better (and sometimes were a lot worse), than their mobile web or mobile app counterparts.
Marcus was asked how far ahead of the bot platform launch Facebook gave developers the final details about what functionality would be offered. He responded, “a couple of weeks only”. When asked if that was enough time to build a high-quality bot, he admitted “probably not”.
“It’s not easy,” said Marcus of rolling out a platform like Messenger’s bots. “It takes time. What we wanted to do at F8 is enable all the over 34,000 devs on the platform, whether they’re building capabilities for third-parties or actual experiences,” he said.
While some bots – like those focused on delivering news – have done well, others have needed a lot of work to offering a compelling experience.
 
But with the addition of webview and payments, something like Hipmunk’s forthcoming travel bot can do things like help travelers find and book airline tickets and hotels, as well as show itineraries right in the Messenger app.
Along with the addition of the new capabilities, developers will also now be given more guidance from Facebook on how to build successful Messenger experiences, Marcus noted.",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/disrupt_sf16-2841.jpg?w=738,"chatbots,facebook-messenger","Facebook Messenger now allows payments in its 30,000 chat bots"
492,"Josh Constine,Sarah Perez","Instagram today is rolling out a feature to all its users that will allow everyone to decide for themselves how they want to moderate comments on the photo-sharing service. First launched for business accounts in July, the social network is now making its default and custom comment keyword blacklists available to all users.
This new feature will allow people to either enable a filter that will automatically block a default list of words to hide from their Instagram comments, or, with the custom keyword list, they can go further and choose certain words that they don’t want to see in the comments on their posts.
This latter option could also help Instagram account owners keep certain topics off-limits, even if the words themselves weren’t considered “abusive.”
Both options can now be enabled by any user in their Instagram profile settings. Taylor Swift was reportedly an early tester of this tool, ahead of its public launch.

Instagram had previously introduced other comment moderation tools, like swiping to delete comments, the ability to report inappropriate comments, and the ability to block user accounts.
Features like these are important because Instagram is public by default, and also typically used for personal photo sharing, that’s a ripe target for bullies and trolls.
“The beauty of the Instagram community is the diversity of its members. All different types of people — from diverse backgrounds, races, genders, sexual orientations, abilities and more — call Instagram home, but sometimes the comments on their posts can be unkind,” writes Kevin Systrom, Instagram co-founder and CEO, on the company’s blog, explaining the need for comment moderation tools.
“To empower each individual, we need to promote a culture where everyone feels safe to be themselves without criticism or harassment. It’s not only my personal wish to do this, I believe it’s also our responsibility as a company,” he adds.
The move comes at a time when social networks are racing to defeat bullying and abuse on their platforms. Instagram itself recently dealt with a high-profile case on online trolling, in fact, which led one of its top celebrity users, Justin Bieber, to shut down his account after his fans began leaving hateful comments on a photo of him and his new girlfriend, Sofia Richie.

Elsewhere on the web, abusive comments – which are often directed at women – have pushed many from participating in social networks. For example, Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones was recently attacked by an online mob of racist, sexist men on Twitter. A previous notable incident saw trolls taunting Robin Williams’s grieving daughter Zelda with photoshopped images of her father’s body. Meanwhile, the entire #GamerGate controversy involved a harassment campaign against those speaking out about the issues of sexism in video gaming culture.
Instagram hasn’t seen as many “newsworthy” cases of online trolling and abuse, as compared with Twitter, but it’s also being more proactive about rolling out new tools before it gets to that point.
Twitter is reportedly building a user-controlled keyword blacklist as well, according to Bloomberg, and it rolled out a “low quality content” spam filter last month. But many of its moves in terms of handling online bullying – including the introduction of a trust and safety council, its banning of revenge porn, and the rollout of other anti-harassment rules – have been seen by many as “too little, too late.”
Instagram, on the other hand, is trying to address the problem before bullying becomes widespread on its service and moving to launch tools at a quicker pace.
Of course, Instagram parent company Facebook may give the service an advantage thanks to its sizable machine learning, anti-abuse, and internationalization infrastructure. Facebook first gave businesses keyword blocking in 2011, for example.
More Personalized Comments, Too
While anti-harassment tools are critical for maintaining a safe community where all people feel welcome, they’re not the only thing Instagram is working on to improve the commenting experience.
The company is also rolling out another change that will show more personalized, relevant comments in the comments preview you see on posts in the feed or on a profile, instead of the two most recent comments. Similar to Facebook, this means you’ll start seeing your friends’ comments before others, when browsing.
This feature will also be available today, along with the keyword blacklist tools.",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/instagram-icon-2016z.jpg?w=738,,"Instagram now lets everyone filter comments using blocklists, will show friends’ comments first"
493,Lora Kolodny,"A San Diego startup called Portfolium has raised $6.6 million to help college students get jobs where they are likely to succeed.
Portfolium CEO Adam Markowitz said he was inspired to build what he calls the “largest student talent showcase,” after his own job-hunting success. A former rocket scientist, he was able to land a dream job working on NASA’s space shuttle program after coming to a job interview armed with a solid portfolio.
“This is the most-educated but most under-employed generation in a long time. And that’s a problem,” Markowitz said.
Unemployment and underemployment rates are hovering around 5.6% and 12.6% for the class of 2016, according to estimates reported by the Economic Policy Institute. And unemployment rates are substantially higher among young black and Hispanic graduates as compared to white non-Hispanic peers.
Unlike LinkedIn, About.me or traditional resumes created for print formats, Portfolium asks students to upload samples of their work to prove they have the skills and experience they say they have.
The work samples could range from a writing assignment, to a video, app, or 3-D model an engineer or industrial designer may have created.
To guard against plagiarism, Portfolium parses work samples, and has integrated with university systems, allowing faculty to both assign and assess work samples through the site.
Partner schools encompass huge state school systems, and small liberal arts colleges alike ranging from California’s UC and Cal State systems to Williams College.
Founded in 2014, Markowitz said Portfolium has partnered with about 200 universities and colleges to-date, and has 3.75 million students under contract.
 
 
Perhaps more importantly for job-seeking students, Portfolium has also partnered with 60,000 employers among them: Oracle, ViaSat, Nike, Intel, Hulu, SpaceX, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Disney, and Cisco.
“Work samples are the number one indicator of future job performance,” Markowitz said, “And they don’t look uniform and dull like a pile of resumes can to a recruiter.”
SJF Ventures led the investment in Portfolium joined by University Ventures, and USA Funds, a large guarantor of student loans.
University Ventures’ Managing Director Ryan Craig said his firm backed Portfolium, in part, because of its rapid uptake within the university market.
“Universities increasingly understand that employability is the primary motivation and concern for new and current students. Higher education can no longer be simply about preparing students for their fifth job; since the recession, we know that if students don’t get a great first job, they’re unlikely to get a great fifth job,” he said.
The investor wants to see Portfolium use the funding for hiring and to develop some new features and services.
One he expects to see within a couple of years from Portfolium is a service that allows employers to connect with students in their early college years to suggest coursework or to offer virtual internships to those who have key competencies the company seeks in an employee.",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/gettyimages-465727260.jpg?w=738,"university-ventures,portfolium",Portfolium raises $6.6 million to get college students into jobs where they’ll kick butt
494,Ingrid Lunden,"As LinkedIn continues to wait for the close of its $26.2 billion acquisition by Microsoft, it continues to build out its business, with the latest developments on the international front. Last week, LinkedIn announced that it had hit 100 million users in Asia Pacific (around one-quarter of its total), and today at an event in Bengaluru, India, it unveiled three new products it’s rolling out in India, where it has 37 million users, that it hopes will now get them (and others) using the site more.
LinkedIn Lite is a new pared-down mobile version of LinkedIn that is designed to work on lower-end handsets and those that are accessing the site with limited or very expensive mobile data services. It will be rolling out in the next couple of weeks, a spokesperson tells me.
Meanwhile, the company has also launched a service called LinkedIn Placements to provide an online test for users and help place them in jobs. And for businesses, it’s launched LinkedIn Starter Pack to set up and run their profiles on the social platform.
LinkedIn Lite. Today at the event in Delhi, CEO Jeff Weiner said that LinkedIn Lite would be rolling out to users in the country in the next few months. As with other “lite” versions made for mobile, LinkedIn’s service does away with things like extra graphics and rich media to download four times faster than LinkedIn’s basic mobile site. The company claims the homepage only takes up 150 KB of data, and further pages 70 KB.
From the looks of the screenshots here, it appears the Lite version may simply be turned on by default in situations where bandwidth might be tight: as you can see the URL is LinkedIn’s basic linkedin.com.
LinkedIn Lite is a late entrant into a market that has seen a number of other attempts to grow usage numbers in India by meeting their mobile data demands: while the vast majority of people in India (which is the world’s second largest smartphone market after China) use mobile phones rather than PCs to access the internet, more generally data is very expensive for the average user, and connectivity is not as fast.
Facebook has been offering pared-down versions of its own social network for years now aimed at developing markets. They include Facebook Lite, an Android app launched in 2015. And Zero, a text-only version introduced in 2010. Controversially, it’s also worked with carriers to launch free versions of its site, too, under the Basics brand: many complained, however, that the service violated net neutrality rules and it eventually got shut down in India. Twitter has also worked on ways of developing its own lighter versions and specific services for markets like India.
LinkedIn Placements. While Lite is designed to get people using LinkedIn more on a daily basis, Placements is a service aimed at making LinkedIn more practical and useful for them.
Here, LinkedIn has partnered with HackerRank, as well as Aspiring Minds, Co-cubes and Wheebox, to develop an online test for users to show off their skills and interests, which are then matched up with a number of jobs being advertised on the site. You then proceed with the usual job finding process that involves interviews, references and more. There are some 50 jobs already up for Placements through the scheme in areas like software development, marketing and finance. (The emphasis initially seems to be software: HackerRank, which powers the first test, specialises in engineering and programming skills tests.)

Placements is an interesting development that touches several parts of LinkedIn’s bigger business strategy. The company has been moving very aggressively into online education services, spearheaded perhaps most obviously with its acquisition of Lynda.com, and this is an interesting development that ties in another way of using the online testing format to help boost another part of LinkedIn’s business.
That other part, of course, is recruitment advertising, which today is the company’s biggest revenue driver. Right now, while LinkedIn is spreading the word about the Placement service to would-be jobseekers, it’s also encouraging businesses to place their ads on the platform to match up those people with positions.
In a market that may have a lot of self-taught programmers and others, it provides one way of trying to circumvent the normal course of students graduating from a particular university, or otherwise be overlooked in the job market. This also potentially gives LinkedIn a more central place in how it believes its platform can influence what Weiner has described as the “economic graph” of our society.
The other area where Placements will help LinkedIn’s bigger business is in getting more users to give it more information. Part of the scheme involves updating and filling out your own profile on the site before you take the online test, which will give LinkedIn a new opportunity to pick up fresh and accurate data about you.
Starter Pack. The last of these is less obvious for consumer users but is an interesting compendium to how LinkedIn hopes to grow its profile as a directory for businesses online, and potentially develop those relationships, too. The promise for the companies that build profiles on LinkedIn’s platform is that they can market themselves better: “Grow your Brand. Grow your Team. Grow your Influence,” is how LinkedIn describes it. More practically, it will give LinkedIn an avenue to court these companies for more recruitment and other ads; and perhaps down the line, after the deal with Microsoft closes, it will give it an avenue to sell more Microsoft products to them, too.
“India is a vital market for LinkedIn, as we work towards realising our vision of creating economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce,” said Akshay Kothari, Country Manager and Head of Product, LinkedIn India, in a statement. Kothari joined LinkedIn when the company acquired Pulse, the newsreading app he co-founded. “It’s already one of the world’s most important economies, and continues to experience strong GDP growth. While LinkedIn has grown multiple folds in India since we started operating here 6 years ago, there’s so much more we want to do here. We are committed to India and to boosting our ability to deliver value to even more members and be a part of their professional growth journey, by investing and innovating locally.”",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/linkedin-india.jpg?w=738,,"LinkedIn courts users in India with LinkedIn Lite, online job placement tests, business tools"
495,Peter Yared,"

Application development has long been fraught with peril: Projects become bloated, expensive and never ship. Implementation technologies tend to match the bloat, ranging from Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to Business Process Management (BPM). As Redpoint’s Tomasz Tunguz recently pointed out, growth in Software-as-a-Service is slowing, and a next generation of applications will weave new workflows across existing applications in novel ways.
The “micro” trend in application development is focused on delivering bottoms-up, simple solutions to complex problems. Micro services can easily integrate multiple systems, micro apps can present them as easy-to-consume user interfaces and micro flows allow users to simply complete tasks across systems. This “micro wave” triad of services, apps and flows offers a new way to weave existing systems in novel, organic ways in order to deliver solutions immediately.
Micro services

Interoperability between apps has long been the holy grail of application development. Heavyweight, top-down architectures such as CORBA/IIOP in the 1990s evolved into SOA in the 2000s. Implementing a SOA required enterprise-wide mandates and coordination. Payload standards such as SOAP are heavyweight and fraught with incompatibilities, especially at the authentication layer.
A few companies such as GE have had the discipline to implement a SOA, but for most enterprises, SOA projects have failed to gain widespread adoption. Even after success, the constant divestitures and acquisitions of the corporate world keep SOAs a moving target.
Over the past few years, micro services have become vogue. Micro services are atomic, self-contained services that perform a single operation on a back-end system, such as a retrieving a customer record. The most common interface to a micro service is the well-known and very straightforward JSON/REST/HTTPS paradigm. Authentication is also straightforward and is typically easy-to-use API keys.
The beauty of micro services is that they are incredibly easy to create, deploy and share. New and existing applications can easily call numerous external and internal micro services. Naysayers correctly point out the micro services can too easily propagate like mushrooms, fail to scale and are hard to share and discover. However, these are problems that should be corralled by policy within an enterprise, rather than heavy-handed technology.
Making it easy for apps to organically communicate with each other has spawned a new generation of app creation and delivery that has made it far easier for both enterprises and software vendors to accelerate a new generation of applications.
Micro apps

Since the introduction of iOS and Android app stores in 2008, mobile apps have taken over as many consumers’ primary interface to computing. With the plethora of apps available, it is so difficult to attract consumers to install an app on their device and keep using it. It is therefore very common for vendors to pile a bunch of features into their apps so they can retain existing users with new functionality, as well as attract more users. As a result, native apps are becoming increasingly bloated and hard to navigate.
A new wave of “micro apps” is emerging that are intelligent and context-aware. Platforms supporting micro apps range from interactive Slack and Facebook Messenger bots to Google’s interactive answer boxes, such as weather and flights. These micro apps are typically single purpose and use a combination of straightforward user interfaces and context.
Facebook Messenger’s micro apps are composed of rich bubbles and menus
Micro apps are based on HTML and load dynamically, typically bypassing app stores and loading directly into existing communication tools like Slack and Facebook Messenger. There is definitely pushback to the natural language aspect of “bots.” However, the ability to quickly load interactive micro apps directly into messengers and even search results is quickly gaining traction. Facebook Messenger, in particular, is quickly integrating new features, such as dynamic menus and interactive units, which can do anything, from helping you buy a shirt to ordering a pizza.
Slack’s director of developer relations, Amit Shevat, sums up micro apps very well: “they must do one thing really well.”
Micro flows     
       
Business Process Management (BPM) tools help organizations implement top-down automation of business processes. They are typically very expensive and take a long time to deploy. BPM tools manage long-lived workflows requiring a combination of human interaction and machine-to-machine transfers.
The first foray into micro flows were by companies like IFTTT and Zapier, which move data from one machine to another — for example, moving a Salesforce closed deal to Zendesk. While these services are popular, they have hit an upper bound in traction and revenue. New companies such as Workato are extending machine-to-machine workflows between SaaS systems, but they are very similar in complexity to BPM solutions, with a domain-specific language suited for programmers.

A micro flow in Slack
The new potential for micro flows is in the arena of human-to-machine interaction. Now that messenger platforms like Slack and Skype provide rich, interactive HTML that lets users interact with back-end systems, there is an opportunity to reinvent how users interact with enterprise software.
With micro flows, users can bypass complex and unwieldy legacy systems to perform simple actions, such as approvals. One of the biggest complaints of modern workers, particularly younger workers, is the difficulty interacting with legacy IT systems that have not been upgraded in years. Much like Generation X workers wondering why there were so many typewriters around, millennials are perplexed by the unnecessarily complicated and antiquated systems at most Global 2000 companies.
Even executives and managers can benefit from micro flows for the multitude of approvals that generally require logging into systems they only occasionally use. Many companies have multiple systems for functions such as expenses. Although IT may have a long-term plan to consolidate systems, micro flows allow executives to interact easily with multiple systems through a single interface.
Because micro flows typically require some type of interaction with a user, they can leverage notification features in mobile devices and messengers. Such simple, easy-to-use micro flows make it easy to fully integrate contributors into a more macro workflow.
The combination of micro services, micro apps and micro flows build on each other to deliver a new paradigm for delivering the next generation of apps. Hopefully we can learn from the lessons of the past and not try to “grow up” the micro revolution.",2016-09-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/micro-apps.png?w=738,"bots,app-developers,micro-services",Why app development is going micro
496,Antoine Amann,"

There’s all manner of advice and guidance on the web for online publishers looking to optimize their social media efforts.
CoSchedule, Fast Company, HubSpot, ShortStack, Forbes, Hootsuite, QuickSprout and others all claim to have the answers to such seemingly simple questions as “When is the best time to post on Facebook?” and “How often should you post stories on Facebook?”
However, many of the strategies used by publishers for optimizing engagement and boosting referral traffic from social are flawed. Using data from leading publishers, we will dispel the myths and demonstrate that there are no universal “best times” to share content on Facebook.
We analyzed the median traffic that articles received from Facebook three hours after they were shared. Using the median for all stories and a year’s worth of data helped ensure the analysis wasn’t skewed by outliers. Our analysis garnered some fascinating discoveries.
Firstly, when we compared three major publishers of national and international news based in South America, France and the U.K., we found significant variance in the shape of the traffic profiles for each publisher.

As can be seen in the above chart, the South American publisher achieved best performance when sharing between 11am and 4pm, and poor performance at other times. The British and French publishers, meanwhile, achieved more consistent results throughout the day, although both experienced peaks in referral traffic at different times.
It’s clear there is no one-size-fits-all approach for publishers, even if they are in the same category — optimal times vary depending on the location of the audience. One explanation for this could be that daily routines and behaviors vary between countries and cultures, which therefore impacts media consumption patterns.
The natural next question is whether there are country-wide best times for posting stories on Facebook. Could it be that readers in France all consume content more consistently throughout the day than the South Americans? Can there be specific guides per country?
We compared traffic data from that same French news publisher with a top-10 French sports publisher of similar size and found that while before 10am they achieved similar results, the curves then diverge. By early afternoon, the news publisher is enjoying a strong peak in traffic, whilst the sports publisher is in a pronounced trough.

Overall, the sports publisher’s traffic is more consistent, with fewer dramatic peaks and troughs, while the news publisher has clearly demarked periods when more readers are clicking through to their stories. Even for two publications of equivalent size working in the same country, there are stark differences in audience behavior depending on the subject matter of the content.
We also compared two similar publications in the same country and looked at the traffic profiles of two top-10 French news publishers. There were still crucial differences — when one publisher experienced a peak in share performance at 11am, it is in fact one of the worst times for the other publisher to be sharing.

Interestingly, there also seems to be significant variance based on article topic. We looked at 220,000 Facebook posts made by our publisher clients between March 20 and July 10, 2016, and sorted them according to the time of day at which they were shared. We then compared performance of posts based on whether the articles were about sports or technology. All shares were obtained using local time, in order to compensate for time zone differences, then normalized by average client performance and volume.

Again, there are important differences, and these nuances help us understand the characteristics of audiences and their varying appetite for particular content types at different times of the day.
But even these descriptions of the individual publishers do not do the subtlety of the data justice. To get the most accurate picture, a publisher would need to perform this analysis again on a real-time basis due to strong daily fluctuations. Indeed this is why many publishers now commit very significant resource to optimizing their performance — with large social media teams and even data scientists.",2016-09-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/postingtime.jpg?w=738,referral-traffic,When’s the best time to share on Facebook?
497,Josh Constine,"Here come the fashbots, and this time they might actually be useful.
Facebook’s seemingly half-baked chatbot platform soured many on the potential of conversation user interfaces. The first bots built by outside developers back in April were clumsy and more trouble than just using a website. So Facebook’s Creative Shop is getting involved, working with bot creator Msg.ai and the Tommy Hilfiger fashion brand to make a flagship chatbot worthy to point to.
The TMY.GRL A.I. Messenger Bot will promote today’s debut of Tommy’s capsule fashion line for supermodel and social media star Gigi Hadid. People can discover it by tapping the message button on Tommy’s Facebook page or posts, opening a shortlink URL or scanning its Messenger QR code.

Through the bot, fashionistas can type questions or select pre-made queries to learn about Gigi, see behind-the-scenes content from the collection’s runway show event and, most importantly, shop for items from the nautical-themed clothing line.
Facebook still hasn’t built a native checkout and payment flow into its Messenger bot platform. Shoppers will be linked out to Tommy Hilfiger’s website to put in their credit card details and confirm purchases. While that might give brands a deeper sense of control over the experience, it likely also reduces conversion rates as leaving Messenger gives them a chance to get distracted or reconsider buying something. It’s something Facebook will hopefully build soon.

I asked why the company is diving into the unproven world of bots, Tommy Hilfiger himself told me “We’re really focused on going directly to the consumer. We are obviously distributed in our own stores and in department stores, but going directly to the consumer is really part of the motive and the future of the omni-channel process.”
Puneet Mehta, CEO of Msg.ai, explains that consumer goods companies are attracted to bots because of “the relationship aspect, not just sales.” If they can create a memorable, interactive experience with their brand instead of just one-way marketing, customers will keep coming back. That’s why Facebook’s marketing experts from its Creative Shop, which typically help out advertisers, got their hands dirty on developing this bot.
How did a 31-year-old company come up with the idea for a chatbot? Hilfiger tells me it started with “a conversation I had with Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook. We talked about innovative ways to enhance the shopping experience. We’re always a bit ahead of the curve.”

Chasing new technologies hasn’t always panned out. While Tommy Hilfiger’s Instagram and Snapchat strategies have been a success, 25 years ago it unsuccessfully tried to build touch-screen vending machines. Hilfiger explains that “We had lots of trials and tribulations with that. The credit card system was working, the touch-screen heated up.”
But now he feels that by relying on a dependable company like Facebook, there’s less to worry about and more to gain as customers embrace new ways to shop.
Tommy Hilfiger CMO Avery Baker tells me that “one of the things that’s always been important in fashion is customer service and the experience in a store.” The TMY.GRL A.I. Messenger Bot will try to answer people’s questions and offer a more immersive, responsive feel than shoppers usually get online.
The bot will try to capture some of the personality of talking to Gigi herself, while remaining transparent that there’s not a human on the other end. “No one wants to feel like they’re being spoken to by the corporate animal,” Baker admits.
Fashion still seems like an unlikely candidate for chatbot success. People can’t touch or try on the clothes, and the bot doesn’t know enough about the user’s style to make smart recommendations about which items they might prefer.
But Hilfiger believes this brand-specific bot could perform better than multi-brand retail shopping bots like Spring, which launched with the Messenger bot platform and was quickly proven confusing and unconvincing.
“I think if you’re an established brand and the consumer is familiar with the brand, they have confidence that that certain cotton or cashmere or denim is the quality that would be acceptable, that they would be confident that the fit would be okay,” Hilfiger concludes. “There’s a lot of different reasons why people shop online. Now they can receive shipments, try on items, and send back what they don’t accept. They don’t necessarily need to touch and feel.”
At the very least, Tommy Hilfiger could use the campaign to lure people into messaging their bot first. That’s critical, since Facebook Messenger only lets brands message people who’ve already pinged them. Getting conversations started is essentially the new version of getting people to Like your Facebook Page. Better to build an audience early than get left behind.",2016-09-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/tommy-hilfiger-bot1.jpg?w=680,"chatbots,facebook-messenger",Facebook steps in to prove the value of chatbots with Tommy Hilfiger
498,Josh Constine,"Facebook has backtracked on its decision to censor a Norwegian journalist and newspaper’s posts, reinstating the nude photo of a child fleeing napalm during the Vietnam war. Facebook had originally told The Guardian that “We try to find the right balance between enabling people to express themselves while maintaining a safe and respectful experience for our global community.”
Now Facebook’s statement to TechCrunch (emphasis ours) is that:
Facebook continues to find itself in problematic situations as it attempts to control what appears in the News Feed. Earlier this year it cited a “technical glitch” for why a Live video of Philando Castile dying after being shot by police disappeared from the social network for several hours before reappearing.
At the time, Mark Zuckerberg said “The images we’ve seen this week are graphic and heartbreaking, and they shine a light on the fear that millions of members of our community live with every day.” That indicated that Facebook saw value in transmitting graphic and potentially disturbing content if it had news value. The company later clarified its policy to me, explaining that it only removes graphic content if it celebrates or glorifies violence.

I’ve recommended that Facebook allow people to report content as graphic but newsworthy so the social network can obscure potentially offensive imagery with a warning that people can click through if they still want to view it. Right now, users can only report content as offensive or graphic, but without the caveat that they think it should stay up. Facebook says people should simply report offensive imagery and it will make the call about what to do with it.
Putting a disclaimer interstitial covering the image would have been a better option in the case of the napalm girl photo, at least until it could decide whether to simply leave it fully visible, instead of deleting the posts containing it.
These censorship blunders combined with the decreasing visibility of news outlets in the feed are surely pushing publishers to reconsider their reliance on Facebook. Unfortunately, most pull too much traffic from Facebook to simply ditch it. Meanwhile, many have already began working with its Instant Articles program that decreases load time in exchange for giving Facebook sweeping control over the visual form of articles and limits the monetization, subscription, and recirculation options publishers typically use on their own sites.
In hindsight, publishers should have been working to deepen direct relationships with their readers rather than jumping head first into a channel they don’t control.",2016-09-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/268d5cb1-673e-4231-a1ef-c9767d3494f1.jpeg?w=738,,Facebook restores censored nude ‘napalm girl’ photo due to “historical importance”
499,Sarah Perez,"Tumblr announced on Thursday it intends to roll out affiliate codes across its site – meaning all users’ blogs – as a means of generating additional revenue. The Yahoo-owned blogging platform teamed up with VigLink to make this transition, which will affect all users who have not specifically opted out of affiliate links via a new option in Tumblr’s Settings.
The switch to affiliate links will also not affect those bloggers who are already using their own affiliate code in the links posted to their own site, notes Tumblr.
VigLink worked to connect about 55,000 merchants to Tumblr’s site, the company says. When blog visitors click one of these new links, they’re taken to a merchant’s website, where they may then make a purchase. In that case, Tumblr will show up as the referrer and then receive the commission.
Typically, when VigLink is involved in handling the rollout of affiliate links, it takes a cut of the commissions the publisher would earn, with 75% of the commission going to the publisher, and the rest kept for itself. However, that split can vary based on things like the traffic type and size of the network, so Tumblr may have gotten a better deal.
For most Tumblr users, the change will likely go unnoticed – affiliate links still redirect the visitor to the same landing page. And in the case that VigLink fails to respond, Tumblr will simply forward the visitor on without an affiliate code. Meanwhile, Tumblr says it will be tracking response times to make sure that the implementation of the new links doesn’t slow down its service.
The addition of affiliate links comes at a time when Yahoo is trying to squeeze more money from the blogging service it overpaid for in a $1.1 billion acquisition deal in 2013. In a call with investors this February, Yahoo CFO Ken Goldman said Yahoo wrote down Tumblr by $230 million. This July, Yahoo further wrote down the value of the Tumblr acquisition by $482 million, citing lower projections for the social network’s future performance.
In part, the writedowns are due to Yahoo’s failure to meet Tumblr’s perhaps too ambitious $100 million sales goal, but also because of the poor performance of publicly traded social media sites like Twitter.
With Verizon’s deal to buy Tumblr parent Yahoo, the future of the blogging site now seems murky.
This is not the first change Tumblr has implemented in recent days, in terms of trying to better monetize its service. Earlier this summer, Tumblr announced it was rolling out ads across all users’ blogs, too. Again, users could opt out in the Settings, but the ads – like the new affiliate links – are switched on by default.
The social network has now updated its Terms of Service to reflect the new monetization scheme.
Tumblr says the affiliate links will start arriving on the site in a couple of weeks.",2016-09-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/tumblr-iphone.jpg?w=738,advertising,Tumblr to roll out affiliate links across all users’ blogs
500,Josh Constine,"Buying cool is the best way for big companies to stay cool.
Snapchat rightly believes in itself, and now it’s getting bankers to bet on that vision without selling its precious equity. Snapchat has secured a line of credit led by Morgan Stanley, potentially with other banks participating, according to Recode.
Snapchat can borrow against that credit line and pay it back later if it needs cash in the lead up to a likely 2017 IPO. That will give it flexibility to go public when the time is right without worrying about having to raise another round of equity financing to pay its expenses. It already raised a $1.8 billion Series F earlier this year.
But the other opportunity afforded by the credit line that today’s report doesn’t discuss is that Snapchat could use the credit line to make acquisitions.
Snapchat has already proven itself a prolific buyer. In 2014 it acquired smart glasses developer Vergence Labs for $15 million to jumpstart its hardware division, and QR code startup Scan.me for $50 million to power its QR Snapcodes. Snapchat bought augmented reality filter startup Looksery for a rumored $150 million last year to create its animated selfie lenses.
This year Snapchat bought 3D selfie maker Seene, and personalized Bitmoji sticker startup Bitstrips for a reported $100 million. And it’s in talks to acquire mobile search and social planning startup Vurb for over $110 million.
CEO Evan Spiegel seems to have taken a note from Facebook, the company he himself refused to sell to. By acquiring new products, even at steep prices, Snapchat can stay ahead of competitors and avoid growing stale.
Though it’s unclear how much credit Snapchat has to play with, its loyal teen user base and budding advertising revenues are worthy of Wall Street’s faith. It’s supposedly on track to earn $350 million in 2016, and wants to be a $500 million to $1 billion business in 2017. If it can maintain its cool, it could continue earning the big bucks and pay back any cash borrowed.
Having the extra credit line gives it the funds to buy startups it thinks could keep it at the forefront of digital culture.",2016-09-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/snapchat-ads.png?w=738,,Snapchat could buy startups without raising money via new credit line
501,Sarah Perez,"Need to post content to multiple social networks at the same time? A new chatbot called Yala wants to help. The bot, live now on Slack with Facebook Messenger support coming soon, not only does the work of posting for you, it’s also intelligent enough to know when to post. That is, Yala uses algorithms and machine learning to determine the best time to post in order to increase your exposure and receive better engagement on the items you’re sharing.
The idea for the bot comes from Gary Levitt, who previously sold his email marketing startup Mad Mimi to GoDaddy back in 2014. Afterwards, he attempted to enter the e-commerce space with an online storefront service Pinecone, but says he had trouble getting it off the ground. That led to the pivot to Yala instead – something that addressed a problem Levitt faced himself while building Pinecone.
“I was dissatisfied with Buffer, and its less impressive competitors, because multi-channel posting took time,” explains Levitt, “especially when it came to scheduling across many channels, editing, choosing times and composing,” he says.
Buffer, by way of background, is a social media scheduling service, which also offers tools that help you determine the best time to publish.
However, with Yala, the idea is to bring a similar sort of intelligence a bit “closer to home,” says Levitt – meaning, Slack.
To determine the best time to post, Yala looks at your social media posting history to determine which times and posts led to the most shares, likes and clicks. It also takes into account things like time zones and other audience behaviors. Plus, the machine learning aspect enables it to improve and automatically correct itself on the fly, given your own social media engagement metrics.
By being able to identify patterns, it’s able to create a posting schedule that refines itself in real-time, Levitt says.
The team saw a 10 percent increase in shares and posts when they used Yala, during testing. (Yala, in case you’re curious, is a slang term in Israel, borrowed from Arabic, which means “get a move on.”)
Currently, the bot works with Facebook and Twitter, and is live on Slack. Additional platforms and social networks are in development now.
Yala is a bootstrapped team of three, and is based in both New York and Israel.",2016-09-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-08-at-11-42-56-am.png?w=738,"social-media,marketing",Yala’s new chatbot knows the best time to post to social networks
502,Darrell Etherington,"it’s the 50th anniversary of Star Trek, counting from the airing of the first episode of the original 1966 Star Trek series starring William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. Facebook is marking the occasion, in a few different ways. First, there’s a personalized greeting appearing atop News Feeds of users who’ve liked or otherwise interacted with Star Trek or sci-fi content on FB, and there’s also a special custom profile frame you can apply to your primary display pic. Finally, and perhaps more importantly, there are redesigned reaction emoji inspired by key characters form the series.
Messenger marketing lead Lindsey Shephard shared Facebook’s various celebrations in a Medium post today, including a gallery (which you can see below) of the step-by-step process FB’s creative team went through in order to produce the stunning papercraft USS Enterprise they used to create their customized creating artwork.
The best part really though are the new reactions, which include custom version of the Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad and Angry reaction options Facebook users can employ to quickly respond to posts. FB’s choices for source material for these range from Star Trek’s original show to The Next Generation, meaning fans from both of these bitterly divided camps of Trekkers can enjoy (but depending on their level of commitment, TNG purists can only express sadness, anger, and love whereas original Trek aficionados have access to anger, humor, love and astonishment).

All Star Trek celebratory content is available to US and Canadian users, only for a limited time, and only if you managed to get into that bucket of FB-identified Star Trek fans. I am a fan, but alas, not fan enough to see these features yet. Ah well; Instruments register only those things they’re designed to register.

503,Fitz Tepper,"As if Twitter’s deal to stream NFL Thursday Night Football didn’t convince you that the social network was going all-in on the NFL, maybe this will.
Twitter announced today (a day before tomorrow’s NFL season opener) that they made a custom hashtag emoji for every NFL team. There is also a #TNF hashtag for Thursday Night Football that shows the NFL logo on a helmet. Like Twitter’s other emojis, these can be activated by tweeting a certain hashtag.
You can see all of the hashtags and emojis below, but not in the actual tweet, because for some reason Twitter doesn’t support these emojis within their Tweet embed product.
It seems that Twitter and the NFL decided to let each team pick their own hashtag, which may have backfired because most teams decided to use phrases that are super vague and probably only known to hardcore football fans.
For example, the Carolina Panthers choose #KeepPounding. While every Panther fan knows this is a motivational phrase the team has used since 2004, most people probably have no idea what it means. Same with #WeAre12 (which doesn’t even have the Seahawks’ logo as the emoji) and #HTTR.
Thankfully some teams decided to keep it simple (or had a really lazy social media manager) and just use their team’s name and logo for the hashtag and associated emoji, like the Super Bowl 50-winning #Broncos.
Anyways, hopefully these emojis will get you in the mood for football tomorrow. But if you want to watch on Twitter, you’re out of luck until next week, because even though Twitter will be streaming all Thursday Night Football games, tomorrow’s season opener isn’t considered part of the Thursday Night Football series (even though it’s on Thursday), so the game will only be on NBC.

504,Josh Constine,"The iPhone 7’s powerful new camera features will be getting the spotlight in an upcoming version of Instagram. Ian Spalter, Instagram’s head of design, appeared on-stage at the iPhone 7 launch event to demo the iPhone-inspired upgrades coming to his app.
The iPhone 7 Plus telephoto zoom lens will be usable by dragging a single finger up and down in Instagram — an interface popularized by Snapchat. Haptic feedback will help you know just how zoomed you are, and could help you stay in the 2X optical zoom offered by the iPhone 7 Plus without straying into digital zoom that degrades quality. Instagram added one-finger zoom to Stories last month so you can do comedic zoom effects while shooting video or quickly line up a shot.
All of Instagram’s color filters are being redesigned to take advantage of the iPhone 7 camera sensor’s wide-gamut color detection. This will make Instagrams even more vivid by divining a broader range hues from your shots.
3D Touch will let you jump right into adding a photo to your Instagram Story. Since Stories are supposed to be raw and off-the-cuff, getting to their camera quicker should let people shoot better candids and avoid missing those spontaneous moments.
And thanks to the Live Photos API, iPhone Live Photos will be able to instantly be converted into Instagram Boomerang back-and-forth GIFs. Previously, you had to shoot Boomerangs in its dedicated app that takes a bunch of stills and combines them into an animation. The new version will let you just shoot in the default iPhone camera and then morph them into Boomerangs.
The partnership between Apple and the Facebook-owned Instagram could drive a potential strategy where Apple builds the underlying technology while leaving the creative flourishes to Instagram. Apple didn’t announce its own animated GIF Boomerang competitor. Instead it’s doing what it does best — the hardware — and letting Instagram handle how to turn that raw power into art.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/instagram-iphone-7.jpg?w=738,iphone-7,"Instagram is building new zoom, filter, and GIF features for the iPhone 7 camera"
505,John Biggs,"A study (conveniently co-written by Facebook) has found that “personal interactions on Facebook can have a major impact on a person’s feelings of well-being and satisfaction with life just as much as getting married or having a baby.” That’s right: it seems that clicking “Like” on a picture of someone’s soup is akin to the eternal bond of love that is marriage or the miracle of biology and coexistence that is the creation of human life.
Now before we go snort into our copies of No Logo let’s take a closer look at the study. Produced by Carnegie Mellon professor Robert Kraut and CMU alum and current research scientist at Facebook Moira Burke, the study found that reading deep and heartfelt notes from people you know on Facebook is what really revs up the old pleasure sensors. Simply getting a like or scrolling past an ad for slippers won’t cut it.
What needs to happen is your friend or loved one has to comment on your stuff. Lots of times.
“This can be a comment that’s just a sentence or two,” said Burke. “The important thing is that someone such as a close friend takes the time to personalize it. The content may be uplifting, and the mere act of communication reminds recipients of the meaningful relationships in their lives.”
It takes sixty comments from close friends to improve a person’s psychological well-being. The findings also caused the researchers to question whether the claims that social media caused loneliness and depression were true. Apparently, under the right circumstances, they aren’t.
The study watched 1,910 Facebook users in 91 countries. Each took a monthly survey and Facebook tracked their usage, albeit anonymously. They were able to assess levels of passive reading, posting, and commenting.
The study found that actual interaction helped improve well-being and could even reduce loneliness and depression. While I doubt any psychologist will prescribe a few hours of Facebook every night, I hope this does give passive users pause: you could be making a real and notable difference in someone’s life if you’d just stop watching that damn Kenzo dance video over and over again in bed.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/9a.jpg?w=738,"social-media,friendship",Your Facebook friends can actually cheer you up
506,Jordan Crook,"Remember Path?
Even though targeting early tech adopters was potentially the wrong ‘path’ for that company, the idea of a close-friends-only social network isn’t a bad one at all.
Enter Camarilla.
Camarilla is a social network that lets you share photos with only 15 people at a time. Moreover, those posts are not public, but are rather sent as a direct message to each recipient, with the ability to have a private conversation around the photos instead of a public one in the comments section.
Instead of allowing up to 50 people (and then 150 people) like Path, Camarilla is dead-set on keeping this private social network as small as possible. The company is targeting young parents and their networks, who prefer privacy over a huge following.
The app has its own network effect, with each new user inviting 15 others to the app, and so on and so on. So far, the beta has spread to 130+ countries, though the Camarilla team won’t reveal just how many active users it has.
Still, the company has recently received $3.37 million from Amerborgh, and has investors who are willing to let the network grow before focusing on monetization.

507,Matthew Lynley,"Pinterest said it has hired Li Fan, the former head of image search at Google, as the company’s new head of engineering.
Much of Pinterest’s most promising technology involves searching for objects within photos and then using that technology to rank and display the most relevant content to users, whether that’s through search or the traditional feed. Users searching for those products may inevitably want to buy them, meaning the products are critical both for its user engagement and commerce products.
That’s increasingly important as Pinterest’s commerce ambitions continue to grow. Offering users the ability to find objects within photos — even through photos they take — can drive them to products they may be interested in inevitably purchasing. In that sense, Pinterest’s visual search (something that Pinterest has quickly distanced itself from the pack with) is becoming one of the best tools that marketers can use to push users closer and closer to a moment of conversion.
Most of Pinterest’s content comes from businesses, whether through the form of promoted content or users simply organically posting products on the service. As a result of that, Pinterest has developed a wide array of advertising tools that helps marketers get their products in front of users at various points in their lives, whether that’s through random discovery, searching or inevitably saving and making a purchase.
Pinterest has also begun rolling out a series of new video-focused tools, both for marketers in the form of advertising products and native videos for Pinterest users. Not surprisingly, a core component of those products will be developing visual search tools for elements within those videos, and continuing to staff up the company with visual search experts is going to be key to those efforts.
The company’s former head of engineering, Michael Lopp, left mid-April earlier this year after joining the company in June 2014. Lopp wasn’t the only engineering departure in the past several years, with Mark Smallcombe serving a ten-month stint as the company’s head of mobile and product engineering.
Fan held senior engineering roles at Google for the past eight years or so, and prior to that was VP of search at Baidu.
So, in the end, a hire like this isn’t that surprising. But what is interesting is, after having a quiet front of the year, Pinterest seems to have started to get very aggressive with new acquisitions and hires. It recently acquired the teams behind Instapaper and Highlight, not to mention a number of smaller companies.",2016-09-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/pinterest.jpg?w=738,"pinterest,li-fan",Pinterest brings on a new head of engineering who specializes in image search
508,Fitz Tepper,"If there is one threat to Google Search, it’s that the majority of content created today lives inside social apps like Instagram and Snapchat and can’t easily be indexed to show in search results.
And, even when Google does manage to pull in a piece of content from a social network, it’s nearly impossible to extract any context from the photo, which is essential if Google wants to monetize these searches with ads.
But it seems like Google has now found a workaround, at least for fashion-related content. The search engine just launched a feature called Shop the Look to bring outfits posted by fashion bloggers into search results.
Google is sourcing content (and the links to buy clothes featured in the content) from rewardStyle’s LIKEtoKNOW.it, a company that lets fashion bloggers make money from their social posts. They do this by helping influencers send followers an affiliate link to buy the products featured in their social posts. For example, if I “like” a picture of an outfit on Instagram the service will email me links to buy all of the pieces of clothing in the photo.
So how exactly will Google use this content and the associated product data?
Users can search Google for an outfit, like “cocktail dress”, and the platform will pull in images from social influencers that match that outfit description. Then once users tap on one of those images it will pull up a gallery with each item of clothing featured in the picture, as well as a link to purchase it.
Interestingly, Google is integrating Shop the Look with its Shopping campaign ad product, meaning retailers can create an ad for an article of clothing to potentially appear in these results.
Not only is the move big for Google (because they could potentially steal some search traffic away from Instagram), but it’s big for the fashion influences who use platforms like LIKEtoKNOW.it to make a living. By including their content (and affiliate links) in search results, they have the opportunity to have their content seen by a lot more people.
The partnership with rewardStyle is still in its early stages, so the two companies haven’t finalized a revenue sharing agreement yet – but it’s safe to assume that if an item is purchased on Google the affiliate revenue will probably be divided up between Google, rewardStyle and the actual influencer who created the content in the first place.",2016-09-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/unnamed.png?w=706,"search-results,photo-sharing",Google is launching Shop the Look to let you search and shop by outfit
509,Natasha Lomas,"Custom computer vision is the promise of bootstrapping Barcelona-based b2b startup Restb.ai. The team is pitching its machine learning algorithms at businesses wanting to fix a pain-point or aiming to enhance what they can offer their customers by being able to automatically determine what is in a particular image.
While tech giants like Facebook and Google are using their own data to train their own AI algorithms for their own ends, Restb.ai’s big idea is to sell computer vision as a service, charging its business customers an initial training fee to build a custom model for their needs and charging per API call thereafter.
The team launched back in March 2015 and has six customers at this point, according to Damia Garcia, the team’s VP of growth and biz dev, speaking to TechCrunch from startup alley here at Disrupt SF 2016. He added it has been focusing its early acquisition efforts on winning larger customers in multiple verticals, and is now looking to raise a seed round.
One user of the tech so far is second-hand goods marketplace Wallapop which has used Restb.ai to identify and prevent users posting images of illegal drugs to sell on the site.
Garcia claimed the accuracy of restb.ai’s model, once it has been trained for whatever custom use the customer intends, is 98 per cent. The system works by the user typing in whatever custom keywords the model has been trained on — such as make/model for cars in the above example — and will specify a percentage of how certain it is of a particular identification.
It works in near real-time — and he noted another application of the tech being police automating cross-referencing number plates with a car make/model to ascertain that a licence plate has not been swapped onto another vehicle.
The training process for each custom model takes some three weeks, according to Garcia, while the amount of data needed to feed the AI varies depending on the application. He said between 150 and 2,000 images are typically needed for training a particular custom need, with data provided by the customer.
In the demo car example 1,500 images were needed per car, although the algorithm can identify a car model from a photo of just a tail light (for example), or from a photo of a crashed car. It can also specify which side/view the image is showing of the car.
Other examples of use-cases for Restb.ai’s computer vision as a service include for real estate marketplaces wanting to identify and index photos of apartment interiors, for example, doing away with the need to manually tag uploaded images and allowing for better targeting of content based on having a better taxonomy of image data; and a Norwegian mining company that’s using the tech to automate and speed up identifying particular mineral crystals — freeing some of its human staff for other tasks.
Garcia named one US competitor — clarifai — but said they are focusing on general modeling, such as identifying nudity, whereas restb.ai is aiming to differentiate by offering custom deployments to meet very specific customer needs.",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/p1040727.jpg?w=738,"ai,computer-vision",Restb.ai offers custom computer vision as a service
510,Natasha Lomas,"Europe’s top court, the CJEU, has been asked to rule on whether a privacy-related legal action brought against Facebook can be treated as a class action or not.
The suit kicked off in Austria back in 2014 with European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems calling for non-commercial Facebook users located outside North America to join the class action — thousands of whom quickly did so.
Technically the suit is not a class action as there is no law on class actions in Austria. However Schrems’ lawyers came up with the idea of grouping claims by “assigning” them to one person who  can sue on behalf of everyone else. Meaning Schrems is the single plaintiff — but would later redistribute any damages to everyone else.
Thus far, Facebook has focused on trying to get the case dismissed on procedural grounds — arguing that the class action is inadmissible, and that the Austrian courts have no jurisdiction in this case. The suit has moved from Vienna’s Commercial Court to its regional court and then the Austrian Supreme Court which has now referred two legal points to the CJEU for a ruling.
One of the points the Court is asking the CJEU for an opinion on is whether a consumer loses their rights to sue in their home court if they engage in a public fight.
Commenting on this point in a statement, Schrems said: “Facebook is obviously trying to argue that I am some sort of ‘commercial activist’, so that I can’t sue them in my home court. In simple terms, Facebook says you have to sit at home and be quiet about your claims — if you make your case public, you lose your rights as a consumer.
“The Austrian courts have highlighted, that the class action is organized on a pro bono basis and that I used my Facebook account in a private capacity. The preliminary question, if I am a consumer, is therefore simple to answer, as I have never made a single Cent though this procedure –- to the contrary I invested hundreds of unpaid hours of work.”
The second point the CJEU is being asked to rule on is whether Austrian law allows plaintiffs to transfer their claims to another person to create a defacto class action. On this Schrems’ lawyers are arguing it is far more reasonable for consumers to be able to file collective actions, rather than having to file thousands of individual procedures in different courts around the world.
It’s not the first legal issue Schrems has managed to bring before Europe’s top court. Last year the CJEU struck down a fifteen-year-old data transfer agreement between the EU and the US after a 2013 legal challenge by Schrems, arguing that US mass surveillance programs were violating European privacy law.
The Austrian suit also uses the NSA’s PRISM surveillance program, which loops US tech companies into government surveillance programs, as a route to target Facebook on privacy grounds.
Other complaints in the suit include Facebook’s own tracking of web users on external websites through its like buttons (something that has also caused problems for Facebook with European DPAs). The company is also accused by Schrems of an absence of effective consent to many types of data use, a data use policy that is invalid under EU law, and unauthorised passing of user data to external applications, among other allegations.
At the time of writing Facebook had not responded to a request for comment about the development in the case. We’ll update this post with any response. Update: A Facebook spokesperson emailed the following statement on the latest development in the case: “Schrems’s claims have twice been rejected on the grounds that they cannot proceed as ‘class action’ on behalf of other consumers in Austrian courts. We look forward to addressing the procedural questions presented to the CJEU to resolve these claims.”
Schrems told TechCrunch the average timeframe for the CJEU to issue a ruling is between one and one and a half years. The court’s decisions are binding on all 28 EU Member States.
Schrems has other legal irons in the fire focused on Facebook’s use of Europeans’ data. Following the strike down of Safe Harbor he filed new complaints against the company targeting the alternative mechanisms it is using to authorize personal data transfers from the EU to the US. The Irish data protection agency has referred those complaints to the Irish High Court to also request a ruling from the CJEU.",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/shutterstock_186292982a.jpg?w=738,"max-schrems,privacy,law",Europe’s top court to weigh in on Facebook privacy ‘class action’
511,Steve O'Hear,"Teads, the video ad company that last month raised $47 million in debt financing in order to go on a buying spree of other adtech startups, is staying true to its word. Today it’s announcing the acquisition of UK and Romania-based Brainient, the interactive video ad startup founded by Emi Gal, who has been a fixture of the London tech scene for almost as long as I’ve been reporting on it.
Founded in 2009, Brainient and its smart Romanian engineering team hit on the idea of increasing the engagement and performance of online video adverts by making them more personalised and interactive.
The former refers to way Brainient-powered ads can tap into any data source to allow the ads served to match a user’s profile and preferences — including socio-demo, geolocation, screen used, time of the day, weather (or basically any other type of contextual data) — while the latter includes things like making video ads ‘shoppable’ or the ability to submit an in-video form to request further information about a product.
The Brainient studio is a suite of tools that takes care of the heavy lifting to make these kind of interactive and data-driven video ads, including ensuring they can easily be reconfigured to work across formats and devices and they are compatible with the disparate video ad networks and publisher properties. And it’s here where Teads’ acquisition of Brainient comes into play.
Bertrand Quesada, CEO of Teads, told me in a call that the plan is to be able to offer the newly-named Teads Studio to the company’s existing customers for free, in order to increase the ROI of the Teads video ad proposition.
That’s because the European company specialises in so-called “outstream” ads: video ads that reside outside of video content, such as placed in an article between two paragraphs of text.
These already potentially perform better than traditional video pre-rolls and by making the ads themselves data-infused and interactive, the idea is to not only enable Teads’ customers to innovate around where video ads are placed and how they are delivered but also within the creative itself. Brainient has always claimed that its interactive video ads perform better than standard ones.
In a call with Brainient’s Gal, he sounded upbeat about the exit, although both he and Quesada declined to reveal terms of the deal. Brainient had raised around $4 million in total funding, including a $1.8 million Series A in 2012 led by Prague-based Credo Ventures with participation from Atlas Venture, Estag Capital, Sherry Coutu, and Dave McClure’s 500 Startups.
A source close to one of Brainient’s investors also told me they were very happy with the return the startup’s exit has produced and they wouldn’t hesitate backing Gal a second time, should he ever go on to start another company. Separately, another source told me that the startup had previously fielded offers of around $10-12 million, so make of that what you will. I also understand that although Gal and Brainient’s other co-founder and CTO Andrei Baragan were the startup’s largest shareholders, they no longer held a majority stake.
Meanwhile, Gal tells me he’ll be relocating to New York City to help Teads Studio sell more into the U.S. market (something he said he needed to do urgently as far back as 2012!) and that this was always the plan once Brainient felt it had become a leader in Europe. He also says that with Teads’ resources, Brainient plans to double the size of its engineering team in Romania and continue to iterate the product.",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/teads-platform-for-video-advertising-solutions.jpg?w=738,"brainient,teads",Video ad company Teads acquires Brainient
512,Mike Butcher,"Great tech talent, an excellent regulatory environment and a world-class city has turned London into the fintech capital of the world. And there’s a boom on. UK fintech firms secured $5.4 billion of the $49.7 billion of global investment in financial tech between 2010 and 2015, compared with the total $4.4 billion raised across the rest of Europe, according to research from Fintech Week London. Transferwise, Currency Cloud and Seedrs are among the stars of the scene.

513,Mike Butcher,"TechCrunch Disrupt in London is beginning to appear over the horizon. We’ve already announced that Accel’s Sonali De Rycker and Atomico’s Niklas Zennström will be on our stage. Today we’re delighted to say that we’ll also be joined by world-famous supermodel Natalia Vodianova.
The Russian model, philanthropist and occasional film actress is well-known for her rags to riches life story and for her eight-season, seven-figure contract with Calvin Klein. But ‘Supernova’ — as she is known — also has an entrepreneurial streak.
Last year Vodianova founded Elbi, an app which makes it possible to donate micro amounts, of £1 or $1, to charitable organizations across the world. These include Save the Children, Walkabout Foundation, and many others. But the app has a twist: it allows users to raise awareness about projects with just a tap of their thumb on the screen, as well as send of support.
Elbi users can draw letters for schoolchildren who are learning the alphabet in Africa, send words of support to a child in a hospital in India, or volunteer content for a charity. Each day users are offered “three good deeds” to choose from.
Elbi is a simple way for charities to engage with the smartphone generation.
Drawings posted in Elbi can be tagged with the Love button (similar to a Facebook Like) and users can then make micro donations inside the app. If the content created is well received by users it will generate more “Loves” and therefore more money raised for a charity.
Elbi was launched in New York last year in the presence of Bill Clinton, Chelsea Clinton and Madeleine Albright, and has been endorsed by Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, and co-founder of the Bebo social network, Michael Birch.
Vodianova has previously said: “Elbi is a platform that brings the power of social and digital worlds to charities and connects them with people around the world. With Elbi you can do small actions that make a big difference. That is what Elbi stands for — little actions that can make a big difference.”

514,Mike Butcher,"Some people might be wondering why a hashtag to do with Paypal has been blowing up on twitter in the last two days. The #PayPal4Palestine hashtag has been making waves on social media after 43 companies and organizations in Palestine published an open letter to Paypal asking for the payment platform to work there. The move came only after PayPal ignored their requests for a formal meeting.
PayPal currently does not work for Palestinians in the West Bank or Gaza, but does work for Israelis living in settlements in the West Bank, which are illegal by international law. Israelis and Palestinians also all use the same currency, the Israeli Shekels. But quite how an Internet platform could work in some areas of a country but not in another — where the areas in question are are in some cases literally meters apart — is puzzling to say the least.
The group behind the hashtag and the letter, Americans for a Vibrant Palestinian Economy (A4VPE), ask PayPal CEO Daniel Shulman (pictured) to consider the fact that PayPal operates in 203 countries, many of which could be considered far less stable than Palestine, including Somalia and Yemen. Yemen is currently engaged in a devastating civil war, while Somalia has been war-torn for many years.
“We have been told that PayPal is concerned about the compliance investments required to enter the Palestinian market. We believe such costs have been greatly overestimated. The U.S. Treasury Department has spent a great deal of time working with the Palestine Monetary Authority to strengthen safeguards against abuse. PayPal currently operates in over 203 countries including places with major problems of corruption and terrorism like Somalia and Yemen. We are confident that Palestine will prove a much easier place to profitably do business than these and other markets that PayPal has already entered,” the group writes in the letter (which is reproduced below).
A spokesperson for startup accelerator Gaza Sky Geeks (GSG), one of the signatories to the letter, said: “GSG is a major work hub for startups and freelancers in Gaza — payments are one of the toughest issues for them. After working tirelessly to win business in the global marketplace, they then have to pay steep fees for wire transfers or foreign banks to get paid. PayPal opening here is one of the most immediately impactful moves that could be done to support the economy here. Gazans we work with can’t understand why PayPal serves Israelis living in the West Bank and is open for business in counties like Yemen and Somalia, but not here. Businesses in Gaza and the West Bank just want access to the same opportunities PayPal affords to the other 200 countries and territories they serve.”
TechCrunch contacted PayPal for its response and they sent us this statement: “PayPal’s ambition is for everyone ultimately to have access to our services for digital payments and commerce, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  We appreciate the interest that the Palestinian community has shown in PayPal. While we do not have anything to announce for the immediate future, we continuously work to develop strategic partnerships, address business feasibility, regulatory, and compliance needs and requirements, and acquire the necessary local authority permissions for new market entries.”
PayPal has a major operation in Israel in the form of its risk team.
Palestine produces roughly 2,000 IT graduates per year. Both the West Bank and Gaza now have a number of technology companies which, ironically, see tech as a way of developing their economy, just as the Israelis do.",2016-09-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/unnamed6.jpg?w=738,,PayPal brushes-off request from Palestinian tech firms to access the platform
515,Natasha Lomas,"The Raspberry Pi Foundation has finally put out an official starter kit for its low cost microcomputer — offering what it dubs an “unashamedly premium” bundle for the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, complete with optical mouse and keyboard in a very Apple-looking shade of white, plus all the cables you need to get up and running. The only thing missing is a screen.
The official Pi starter kit is available to order online in the U.K. from the Foundation’s distributors element14 and RS Components, priced at £99 (+VAT). While sales are slated to open up to markets in the rest of the world “over the next few weeks”. It’s something of a full revolution for the Foundation which conceived the original Pi with the intention of inspiring schoolkids to learn programming the hard way — i.e. by trial and error and messing around with wires and cables, rather than being handed an ‘it just works box of bits’ to plug and play.
Four and a half years later, with more than 10 million of its single board Pi microcomputers now sold, the Foundation evidently feels it’s time to put a cherry on top of the project with its own shiny white starter kit. And fair play to them. In February last year the Pi had racked up 5 million unit sales. But the expansion of the range to the $5 price-point with Pi Zero last November has clearly helped accelerate demand.
The project has also scaled wildly beyond the Foundation’s original goals, with many a Pi finding its way into the hands of a crafty maker or clever startup, not just aspiring student coders. So the market for Pi will surely accommodate a premium bundle likely to appeal to gizmo lovers in the Western world, while continuing to support expanding access to computing in developing markets via the Foundation’s most affordable Pis.
The Foundation is by no means the first to offer a Pi starter kit. Indeed, the lack of an official kit provided a window of opportunity for third parties to put together Pi bundles of their own, such as London-based startup Kano which offers a bundle aimed at kids that includes not just hardware bits but its own software skin running atop the Pi’s OS with gamified elements. So while the arrival of an official kit may now squeeze out some players, there’s likely to continue to be room for a range of specialized starter kits targeting different niches.
The full list of items included in the official Pi starter kit is as follows:",2016-09-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-09-at-1-46-29-pm.png?w=738,"raspberry-pi,apple-keyboard,computer-mouse,microcomputer",Raspberry Pi finally offers an official starter kit after passing 10M sales
516,Natasha Lomas,"Europe’s top court has ruled that knowingly posting links to copyrighted material can be an infringement of rights holders’ rights — even though the copyrighted material in question is being hosted elsewhere. People posting links in a for-profit scenario also have an obligation to have checked they are not infringing copyright, in the court’s view.
The ruling pertains to a specific case involving a Dutch news website, GeenStijl, which repeatedly posted links to Playboy photos of a local TV presenter. The photos at the centre of this dispute were being hosted on various other websites without the consent of the rights holder, and GeenStijl had apparently ignored requests by the rights holder to stop linking to the copyrighted material. Although the case dates back to 2011, an appeals court in the Netherlands sought a preliminary ruling from the CJEU on the hyperlinks copyright point and that’s now been issued today.
While the CJEU ruling notes the importance of the flow of information between individuals online for fundamental rights such as freedom of speech and expression, it also emphasizes the need to maintain what it dubs a “fair balance” between the interests of rights holders and the fundamental rights of users of protected objects. It’s that ‘balance’ the ruling seeks to achieve by creating a distinction between knowingly posting a link to copyrighted material vs doing so unaware and with no intention of seeking financial gain.
In its announcement of the ruling, the CJEU writes (emphasis mine):
As Fortune notes, the ruling is unusual in that it goes against the earlier opinion of the court’s advocate-general who back in April recommended that links to copyrighted material should not be considered a copyright breach themselves. AG opinions are usually highly influential on the CJEU — but in this instance the court has sought a third way, ruling that linking when unaware of copyright infringement and in a not-for-profit context is fine but adding a set of exceptions where a hyperlink could be considered a copyright breach in and of itself. It’s a ruling that threatens to complicate how copyright operates online in Europe by adding another lay of complexity.
Most obviously the ruling could have substantial implications for search engine Google, whose core business involves hyperlinking to content hosted elsewhere. (In Europe the search engine has a more than 90 per cent share of the search engine market.) But the impact could potentially stretch to any for-profit online publisher which hyperlinks to others’ content. Although it remains to be seen how broadly courts in EU Member State interpret the notion of posting a link for financial gain.
Google publishes a Transparency Report providing an ongoing tally of search result links that it has removed at the request of rights holders. This shows that in the past year it removed 832 million links to content on 342,000 websites. And while that’s already a very large number, all those instances involve Google responding to a takedown notice from a rights holder. By contrast the CJEU ruling appears to imply that for-profit entities such as Google might have a pre-emptive responsibility to check the legality of the content they are linking to before serving a hyperlink to a user — rather than waiting to receive a takedown notice. Which would be a huge shift.
On the flip-side the ruling suggests that individuals who post links to pirated content online without knowing the content they are linking to is copyrighted and without doing so for their own financial gain would not be infringing copyright — with the court noting “it may prove difficult, in particular for individuals who wish to post such links, to ascertain whether the works involved are protected and, if necessary, whether the copyright holders of those works have consented to their publication on the internet”.
As it happens, the EU is also in the midst of reworking the region’s copyright law — with a proposed reform package due to be published later this month, on September 21.
Late last month a leaked version of the EC’s copyright reform document suggested the Commission is planning to extend copyright protections to publishers — taking a similar approach to the German government which, back in 2014, backed a so-called ancillary copyright law designed to cover the news snippets displayed in Google News. A similar law was enacted in Spain — without a publisher opt-out and with a mandatory fee for displaying publisher snippets — leading to Mountain View to pull the plug on its Google News service in Spain.
It remains to be seen how or whether the CJEU hyperlink copyright ruling impacts Google’s business — as well as how or whether any EU-wide expansion of ancillary copyright for publishers might play out. We’ve reached out to Google for comment and will update this post with any response.
Expressing concerns about the EC’s copyright reform process late last month, Mozilla’s chief innovation officer Katharina Borchert described the hyperlink as “the basis of the open Internet”. The organization is actively campaigning for EU copyright law to better reflect the reality of how web users share content online.
Discussing concerns that the Commission intends to support the expansion of copyright for publishers last month, Borchert also touched on some of the key concerns that are likely to follow today’s CJEU ruling, telling TechCrunch: “The question is what are the obligations of content platforms and how much do you really force them to check everything before it is finally uploaded? What does that mean for free speech?
“Do you really want platforms to be the gatekeeper that make the decision of whether something still falls under a parody exemption or it doesn’t? Those are really difficult questions where in the past the balance really hasn’t been struck right.”",2016-09-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/p10406971.jpg?w=738,"europe,cjeu,copyright,copyright-law",Europe’s top court rules linking can infringe copyright if done for profit
517,Devin Coldewey,"If you work in any kind of storage facility or warehouse, there’s a better chance every day that you’re going to be working alongside robots. Magazino’s TORU is a good example of the latest generation: navigating by sight, safe around humans, and simple to put to work.

Laser rangers let it identify and roll around humans and unexpected obstacles, and there are no big, free arms to whack them with. No special beacons or reflectors are needed to tell the bot where it is, either; it checks its perceived environment against a stored map and deduces its position from that.
Here it is doing its thing:

A set of three TORUs are being delivered to the Fiege Mega Center, a major warehouse in Erfurt; the company’s CEO, Jens Fiege, sounds appropriately thrilled in the press release:

518,Romain Dillet,"French startup Oui Open, also known as PopupImmo, is merging with its American competitor Storefront for an undisclosed amount of money. The two entities will soon provide a global marketplace of pop-up stores so that brands can open a bunch of stores on multiple continents using the same service.
From what I understand, Oui Open is merging with Storefront but keeping the Storefront inventory as well as the brand. In fact, Storefront seems to be a more powerful brand and could become the new consumer-facing brand for the new entity.
The two companies provide more or less the same services. Many brands have relied on pop-up stores for particular events or product launches. For instance, a company like Samsung could open tiny temporary stores in the heart of various capital cities around the world to showcase its latest Galaxy Note device.
But it can be cumbersome to find temporary retail spaces, get insured for these spaces and even convert the spaces. Startups like Oui Open and Storefront have helped brands like Google, Samsung, Target and Etsy open pop-up stores.
It’s a marketplace business model, meaning that it starts with a big inventory of spaces. These two companies have been around for a while and are going to be even more effective when it comes to attracting landlords. Together, they will manage 10,000 listings in New York City, Paris, London, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Amsterdam and more.
Then it’s a matter of making bookings as seamless as possible. With standardized contracts and insurance policies, it’s much faster to use a marketplace like Storefront or Oui Open to book a space.
While the market for pop-up stores will probably never be as big as Airbnb’s market, the average transaction is significantly higher than a typical Airbnb transaction. In other words, it’s a healthy market and commercial real estate managers should worry.
On the other side of the equation, it makes sense for brands to open more and more pop-up stores. You don’t want to commit with stores that will remain empty most of the time due to seasonality and product launches. It’s a cheaper way to get started and have a retail presence when it’s the right time.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/store-984393_1920.jpg?w=738,"france-newsletter,storefront,popupimmo,oui-open",Oui Open merges with Storefront to become a global pop-up store marketplace
519,Steve O'Hear,"Back in July we reported that Amazon was set to launch a restaurant delivery service in London for its Amazon Prime customers and now the e-commerce giant has done just that.
Dubbed Amazon Restaurants, the service is available in select postcodes via the Amazon Prime Now app and promises to let you order food from partner restaurants for delivery within the hour. It competes directly with the likes of Deliveroo and more recently Uber’s UberEats in the UK capital city.
Amazon says there are no menu markups or hidden service fees, and delivery on all orders is free for Prime members with a minimum order of £15.00. (Prime membership is not free, of course, starting at £79 per year but includes a whole bunch of perks, such as movie streaming and unlimited next day delivery on select items etc.)
It also says that if a customer finds a restaurant item that is priced higher than the regularly priced item on the restaurant’s current online menu within 24 hours of placing the order, Amazon will refund the customer the price of the item.
That feels like a pre-emptive move in case a price war breaks out between competing online ordering and delivery services, and by pitching Amazon Restaurants at existing Prime members, the headline price of free delivery will also put pressure on Deliveroo and UberEats within Amazon’s existing Prime customer pool. Both Deliveroo and UberEats have been heavily discounting at various times as the restaurant food delivery turf war in London continues.
Then, of course, there’s competition for couriers. Both Deliveroo and UberEats have seen discontent amongst their “self-employed” workforce over the terms of payment for carrying out deliveries, leading to a series of “wild cat” strikes and an attempt at some form of unionisation.
How having a third and large player in the form of Amazon Restaurants will affect the market for couriers is yet to be seen, although, presumably, Amazon will be utilising its existing network of same-hour delivery drivers and re-deploying them during lunch and dinner times, so the effect may be incremental, depending how fast the service grows.
“London offers some of the best cuisine from around the world, so we’re delighted that Amazon Prime customers can now enjoy food from their favourite restaurants via Amazon’s ultra-fast Prime Now service,” said Al Wilkinson, UK Head of Amazon Restaurants, Amazon, in a statement.
“Based on our own research into what is important to consumers in food delivery, our team have hand-picked a selection of the best quality local restaurants in London. We’re excited to be helping many of these small businesses start offering home delivery for the very first time.”

520,Ingrid Lunden,"While Square continues to take small steps into Europe, a would-be homegrown rival has made its first acquisition to expand from mobile payments into a wider set of commerce solutions. iZettle — the Swedish mobile payments startup backed by the likes of Intel, American Express and Spanish banking giant Santander — has bought intelligentpos, whose cloud-based software lets businesses in the hospitality and other industries manage their inventory, loyalty programs and customer flow.
Terms of the deal are not being disclosed, iZettle CEO and co-founder Jacob de Geer told TechCrunch. The Edinburgh-based startup had raised only $770,000 in angel funding prior to its exit. De Geer said that intelligentpos will add another €500 million in processing volume to the €3 billion that iZettle already processes annually.
Intelligentpos is a cloud-based service and is complementary to iZettle in a couple of ways.
The first is in its feature set and how it is used by customers. Both take advantage of using generic hardware (in their case, an iPad or Android tablet); iZettle has built a service focused on simple and quick transactions, while intelligentpos is essentially focused on everything else around the business-customer relationship, with its biggest product to date focused on the hospitality industry.
The second way in which they complement each other is in their pricing: Up to now, iZettle’s revenues have come by way of taking a small percentage commission on each transaction made by the merchant (like Square, the basic cut is 2.75 percent). Intelligentpos, however, is a built on a SaaS model, “and that adds a different type of revenue stream we haven’t been working with up to now,” de Geer said.
Intelligentpos has up to now focused most of its efforts on the U.K. market, but de Geer said that under iZettle, the intention will be to take that elsewhere: iZettle has made a mark not only in Europe, where it competes against the likes of PayPal and SumUp/Payleven for small business customers (many of whom may not have had any payment card acceptance in the past because of the high rates charged by banks); but also Brazil and Mexico, by way of its strategic investment from Santander.
De Geer said that while it may have taken several years for iZettle to make its first acquisition, it won’t be the last. Like Square, the company is looking to go beyond its original payment roots as a route to more recurring revenue and a wider customer base. That’s also included services like business financing in the past, and de Geer said that today, the next target “could be anything.”
“It can be something in [payment] terminals to small business insurance,” he continued. “There is a lot out there right now ripe for consolidation. I know what all of them are looking for is a scalable way to acquire new customers and that is one of iZettle’s core strengths. And we are regulated, which means we can work with any financial service.”
The company, he added, is buying intelligentpos with a mix of cash and equity, bringing on employees as well as customers and tech. iZettle has to date raised just over $172 million, with the most recent tranche of $67 million coming a year ago and valuing iZettle at around $500 million, according to sources close to the company.",2016-09-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/izettle_6sept_001.jpg?w=738,"mobile-payments,izettle",iZettle buys intelligentpos to expand from mobile payments to commerce solutions
521,Mike Butcher,"DriveTribe, the vertical online community for motoring fans to be launched by former Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, has now secured $6.5 million (£4.9 million) from 21st Century Fox. The move comes less than three weeks after the announcement of its $5.5 million Series A funding, led by Breyer Capital and Atomico.
The site expects to launch in November 2016 as the “world’s digital hub for motoring” and has been co-founded by the three celebs, together with their long-time producer/collaborator Andy Wilman, and serial technology entrepreneur Ernesto Schmitt.
The site will feature “Tribes” — basically forums — hosted by the three celebrities, along with invited stars, bloggers, writers and videographers, who generate and curate the content. A content engine will target the best content for each community. It sounds like it will be a like a bunch of motoring Facebook groups lumped together, with some more tech thrown in.

522,Steve O'Hear,"I’ve just finished watching Entrepreneur First‘s sixth cohort’s Demo Day Demo in London. The event, held at Facebook’s UK HQ, saw 21 newly outed startups pitch their wares on stage to investors, press and other actors in the European tech scene.
But before I give a run down of the presenting companies, including our top 3 picks, here’s a quick reminder of how EF works and what has made it the new darling of the UK startup community.
Founded back in 2011 by Alice Bentinck and Matt Clifford, the so-called “talent first” investor targets the best technical graduates in Europe and beyond to put them through a six-month program where they form teams and in turn found startups.
This includes financial support in the form of a monthly stipend for living costs while founders find their co-founders and decide on an idea. This is then followed by £10,000 in pre-seed funding, in addition to office space, legal and administrative support, and mentoring and advice from the EF team and external entrepreneurs from the wider UK startup scene.
It is this “pre-team, pre-idea” approach that sets EF apart from other accelerators — and something that initially left the rather conservative European VC industry grossly underestimating its potential — while the emphasis on technical talent is producing some very interesting results.
Not least, EF’s biggest (albeit only significant) exit to date: Magic Pony, sold to Twitter for a reported $150 million and creating a huge return for EF itself and the 1-year-old startup’s other early investors.
EF has also raised two funds of its own, having just announced its £40 million “Next Stage Fund” to add to £8.4 million raised last year. The new investment vehicle, which is majority backed by the UK taxpayer-funded British Business Bank and also counts LPs such as Imperial College, Sir Charles Dunstone’s Freston Ventures, and Isomer Capital, will co-invest in graduating companies at the seed and Series A stage.
Calipsa describes itself as automating traffic video surveillance using Artificial Intelligence. Its computer vision and big data technology claims to be able to tap into a city’s existing CCTV infrastructure (no new hardware required) and crunch all of that data on a per vehicle or item level, including counting cars!
And, ‘Big Brother’ tendencies not withstanding, the resulting efficiencies have a lot of potential to improve city security, traffic control and planning. Or, in the words of the team pitching, to make our cities smarter.
Accurx is tackling the problem of eliminating inappropriate use of antibiotics, which is a major contributor to the diminishing effectiveness of antibiotics. Basically, antibiotics are dramatically over-prescribed and, due to bacteria resistance, are becoming less effective.
To help physicians make better decisions regarding appropriate use of antibiotics, the startup is building what it describes as a “supervised, linked, person-level dataset, to provide empirical diagnoses free from human biases”.
In practice, this translates into much better data, linking medical history, presenting symptoms, treatment given, and, most crucially, clinical outcomes. By crunching this data and providing supporting tools, the idea is to remove human bias from the antibiotic prescription process.
Admittedly more frivolous than most of the ideas being pitched today, Drafter is an inbox assistant that automatically drafts email responses based on your previous interactions.
It’s initially aimed at sales people. Why? Because — or so the pitch goes — a speedy response to a sales enquiry, of, say, 5 minutes, dramatically increases the chances of closing a sale.
In fact, the first to respond is invariably the person who wins the deal, yet response times are on average 10 hours. And so much of sales involves a very repetitive workflow.
Eventually, however, Drafter, wants to apply its tech to any kind of email, eliminating the times you begin composing a new email only to think, “I’m sure I’ve written this exact same response before”.

523,Jon Russell,"Update: The deal has been confirmed.
Huge news for China’s ride-sharing industry: It appears that Didi Chuxing will gobble up rival Uber China in a merger deal that will value the combined entity in China at $35 billion.
The rumor has being doing the rounds for about a month now, with both sides denying but it looks like a deal is happening. Both Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal cited sources claiming that a deal has been agreed upon. The timing is interesting, too, since last week the Chinese government released proposed regulations that will make taxi-hailing services legal from November 1.
Bloomberg reports that the deal will see Didi, which has more than $7 billion in cash on hand after extensive fundraising, invest $1 billion into Uber’s global business for Uber China’s operations. In exchange, Uber China and its investors, which include Baidu, will take a 20 percent stake in the newly merged entity in China. Uber China was most recently valued at $7 billion; Didi’s most recent valuation was $28 billion.
This deal means that Didi is now invested in every ride-sharing company of size on the planet, having previously put money into Lyft, Ola in India and Grab in Southeast Asia.
We’ve contacted Uber and Didi for comment and will update this story accordingly.
This is not the first mega merger in China’s ride-hailing space. Didi Chuxing itself was created when Didi Dache and Didi Kuaidi called a truce on their capital intensive subsidies war in a merger last year that was valued at around $6 billion.
Uber has spent billions in China — a Bloomberg source said it is losing $2 billion in the country to date — so it looks like the same reasons are behind this second merger deal, albeit that the potential repercussions are very different. Offloading its Chinese unit could put Uber on track to finally list as a public company. The U.S. firm said last month that it is already profitable in Western markets and, with China its biggest money-drainer and weakest market from a competitive standpoint, a major question mark around its business will be removed if this deal goes through.",2016-07-31,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0073.jpg?w=738,"ride-hailing,uber-china,didi-chuxing",Uber China will reportedly merge with archrival Didi Chuxing
524,Hugh Harsono,"

Indonesia presents much opportunity for e-commerce among other emerging Asian economies, with current projections putting this archipelago nation’s e-market at $130 billion by 2020 (coming third behind China and India). With an estimated annual growth rate of 50 percent and strong mobile-first initiatives, retailers have a unique opportunity in Indonesia to focus on developing truly mobile platforms to help facilitate e-market growth, particularly in the consumer packaged goods (CPGs) sector.
Indonesia’s current e-commerce market is similar to China’s online marketplace beginnings, with a large pool of entrepreneurial sellers providing goods purchased based largely on social media recommendations. Similarly, e-commerce in Indonesia also mimics the early U.S. e-market, which was flooded with customers wary to trust online payments and retailers. Indonesia is truly unique in that it has the potential to create a hybrid of the widest opportunities from America and China’s e-commerce economies, propelling the Indonesian online marketplace onto the global stage.
Indonesia has established itself as one of Asia’s foremost mobile-first nations, with a StatCounter report estimating that in 2015, more than 70 percent of Indonesia’s internet traffic originated from mobile devices.
Further evidence that Indonesians have embraced mobile-first initiatives comes from social media, with Indonesians having the highest mobile Facebook usage rate worldwide, with 63 million users in 2015. Further projections put Indonesians’ future Facebook access via mobile being almost 99 percent by 2018, showing a true dominance over desktop platforms. The mobile-first path that Indonesia has taken also allows retailers to focus on creating truly mobile functionality, presenting unique opportunities to dominate in the retail space.
E-commerce startups founded in Indonesia or targeting it as an untapped market are growing exponentially, something reflected in increased interest in startup fundraising within the archipelago nation.
aCommerce, an end-to-end e-commerce service provider, closed a Series A venture capital round of $10.7 million, while raising another $10 million in funding ahead of a planned Series B raise later in 2016; this action is being led by MDI Ventures, a VC-initiative launched by Indonesian telecom giant Telkom Indonesia.
Jakarta-based grocery delivery app HappyFresh raised an impressive $12 million Series A round in 2015, with investors led by Vertex Ventures and Sinar Mas Digital Ventures. HijUp, another Indonesian e-commerce startup, closed a second seven-figure seed funding round from investors, including Fenox Venture Capital and 500 Startups.
However, the behemoth of all Indonesian deals so far comes in the form of Tokopedia, an online marketplace that raised an impressive $100 million round led by Softbank and Sequoia Capital. Mid- and later-stage investors should definitely keep an eye on Indonesian startups, which are clearly having very little trouble finding early-stage interest and investment.
Prospering with multiple entrants
Indonesia’s retail market currently consists of CPGs being sold in retail spaces known as “fragmented trade,” which is primarily made up of independent small business owners. E-commerce is currently growing at a rate twice as fast as fragmented trade, forcing many of these independents to turn to the e-commerce model. This in turn creates a sea of individual sellers eager to satisfy e-consumer demand, alongside mass retailers targeting this same demographic.
Unlike other Asian nations, Indonesians currently do not solely rely on mass retailers to guide their purchasing decisions, allowing for these individual sellers to maintain market share. This in turn allows the e-market segment to be open to any competitor determined enough to form a market impact, something uncommon in other mobile-first nations.
Procuring specialized goods to rural areas
Many Indonesian cities are currently woefully underdeveloped, because of a lack of strong government and infrastructure to support retail construction. However, e-commerce’s rise in popularity exploits this challenge by allowing consumers to purchase CPGs previously unavailable in their specific locales.
With lots of potential growth in rural and semi-rural areas, e-commerce specifically allows Indonesian consumers to source hard-to-find goods, as opposed to other nations, where rural areas would not have as high use of internet-capable mobile devices. In fact, popular Indonesian online site BliBli has more than one-third of its 2.5 million customers living in rural areas, providing goods ordered almost exclusively off mobile platforms to a population whose sole form of internet access comes via smartphone. This procurement of specialized CPGs to rural areas makes Indonesia a uniquely perfect place for online marketplace growth.
Providing truly mobile-first platforms
Indonesia’s e-market also allows for retailers and participants in the fragmented trade space to focus on developing truly mobile-first platforms. This specifically targets the mobile user as the captured demographic, instead of simply re-tooling a desktop platform to a mobile one.
This truly mobile-first scenario also allows sellers to use smartphones to their advantage, gathering hyper-personalized data to target individual Indonesian consumers as opposed to just specific demographics or groups among Indonesia’s more than 250 million population.
Mobile-first also allows for the easier entry of participants into the Indonesian e-commerce scene, with startups having the flexibility to choose what CPGs they sell, and even who they want as a consumer, through market penetration via mobile apps.
Profitability through social media
With other mobile-first nations being split between different social media sites (China: Weibo/QZone/Tencent QQ; India: Facebook/Google+/Twitter; Philippines: Instagram/Snapchat/Facebook), Indonesia is unique because of its widespread use of a singular social media platform: Facebook (with more than 92 percent of Indonesians having a Facebook account).
With so much of Indonesians’ current purchasing power being shaped through social media recommendations, focusing on developing integration with Facebook’s platforms offers companies a unique space to potentially profit through direct CPG sales, advertising or even partnerships. Tying Facebook into popular sites such as online forums like Kaskus and Tokobagus, or even online stores like Sukamart, could lead to the inclusion of high-quality videos, product comparisons and optimized images, alongside other mobile-first features, to encourage e-market growth.
Potential with online payments
Indonesian consumers are very wary of online payments, much like Americans were in the U.S.’ early online marketplace days, particularly when compared to other mobile-first populations. Many e-commerce transactions are currently paid through either direct bank transfer or bayar di tampat (cash-on-delivery), which is greatly limiting e-commerce growth through lost transactions.
With Indonesian spend growing nearly 10 percent annually, bayar di tampat will soon be unsustainable. Creating a trusted solution to utilize online payments could lead to huge growth, with retailers both large and small being able to streamline their business flows for optimum efficiency.
Procuring a modernized logistics/delivery platform
Indonesia currently also presents a unique opportunity for e-commerce growth because of the country’s weak infrastructure and poor logistics system. This provides a huge growth area for the e-market, with sellers able to vertically integrate their delivery systems with their ordering ones.
In the age of companies developing in-house solutions instead of relying on outsourcing, the untapped logistics market also gives rise to the growth in Indonesian e-commerce. Companies have the ability to develop proprietary, or even simply more efficient, delivery systems as another form of competition in the online marketplace, with supply strength being a key component in e-commerce.

With so many mobile internet users, combined with weak internal infrastructure, companies and individual sellers alike have the potential to grow the e-commerce market to heights unseen. Additionally, a growing middle class with disposable income will only help spread e-commerce growth, alongside a rising influx of both individual sellers and corporations vying to compete in the e-market.

525,Harris Siddiqui,"

You might call it a Hollywood makeover of the tech industry; Netflix, a company that used to send you DVDs by mail and was almost sold to Blockbuster for a paltry $50 million, is now a juggernaut staring down big TV networks as it makes their programming and business models seem almost archaic for today’s world.
The streaming service effected a culture of entertainment being “anywhere, on anything and anytime you like” as the benchmark expectation for an entire generation, forcing other networks out of their comfort zones and making them up their games.
But to Asian internet users, Netflix seemed like another among many of the wonderful first-world luxuries that kept making waves on the news but never seemed within reach. Even today, being a native South Asian, it’s difficult getting used to the idea that one can get a Netflix subscription where high-speed internet access is still not available to everyone. The service was, until recently, available in only a select few regions with varying limitations on its library.
The past two years have witnessed a renaissance of worldwide expansion in tech companies. The services that had been exclusive to the U.S. and Europe swept through Asia with unprecedented efficiency. You can now summon an Uber cab in New Delhi or ask Google Now to help you navigate the wild valleys of Swat in Pakistan. This is because these companies aren’t unaware of the fact that Asia is currently the driver of the world’s economy, while other continents’ financial conditions are ever-increasingly strained. The continent’s snowballing growth is showing no signs of stopping, thanks to domestic supply and demand.
When Netflix set foot in developing and emerging markets such as India, it was greeted by stiff competition, long-established and deeply rooted among local audiences from the get-go. Players such as HotStar, a streaming service run by STAR India, and Eros, a company that both produces and distributes a large selection of Bollywood movies and Indian TV shows online, had seized the opportune power vacuum early while Netflix had been fixated on U.S. and European markets.
These upstart players found success by catering to local tastes while keeping the price-of-entry in line with the region’s socioeconomic expectations. HotStar understood the mania that drew a large viewership for live cricket in India, while Eros Entertainment brought its offerings to the masses with free basic plans.
Netflix, meanwhile, currently offers its most basic subscription for 500 INR (or around US$7), more than twice the cost for a monthly subscription to HotStar. Considering the fact that Netflix is still severely lacking when it comes to licensed local content available for streaming, the asking price falls somewhere between luxury and redundancy. Given the massive amounts of popularized content being churned out by Bollywood and Indian television every year, the Netflix library immediately loses its premium label and luster for the average user in India.
In other parts of Asia, there are more than 35 different streaming services catering to local markets with similar strategies. iFlix, available in Malaysia, Thailand and Philippines offers licensed content from U.S. studios to a subscriber base surpassing 1 million viewers. In Indonesia, the situation becomes bleaker for Netflix, as some ISPs are outright blocking its services, while iFlix has forged partnerships with local satellite services such as Ooredoo. Indonesia has the fourth largest population in the world, with more than 100 million internet users, a number that is projected to grow to 133 million in the next 3 years.
Other challenges the streaming giant faces range from political to regulatory. The proverbial elephant on the list of countries in which Netflix has yet to launch is China, where it may take years for the service to get greenlit, if at all.
China represents the second largest theatrical market in the world, and is quickly becoming the benchmark for international success for movie studios. When big budget risks such as Terminator Genisys and Pacific Rim failed to spark at the box office in western markets, they found resounding success among Chinese audiences, where moviegoers are not only accustomed to Hollywood’s over-the-top flare and spectacle, but outright expect it. It’s needless to say that catering to the Chinese market is becoming increasingly important for studios producing global content these days.
There are caveats, though.

In China, Netflix cannot operate without specific permission from the government, and even then it has to walk a razor-thin line over the nature of content it can and cannot distribute in the country. The Chinese government monitors, moderates and censors all content its citizens can access online.
Netflix’s “House of Cards” found an unlikely audience on Chinese streaming site Sohu, to the extent that it became the most popular show at the time before censorship authorities caught wind of it and took it down. Chinese censorship laws prevent not only violence and sexually explicit content, but also dictate that any content based on anti-authoritarian, anti-military, religious or political themes be blocked altogether.
“Recently, China’s online entertainment censorship regulations have actually become stricter and must officially meet the same standards met by more conservative television stations,” says Aynne Kokas, an Assistant Professor of Media Studies at the University of Virginia. “In practice, online content is much more difficult to regulate because of the vast numbers of distribution options available. But I don’t foresee a more formal liberalization of online censorship happening in the near term.”
When I asked her whether Netflix had the capacity to adapt to such restrictions, she added: “I do envision Netflix altering, or at a minimum, expanding, its content to cater to China. We can already see that happening with Netflix original programming like Marco Polo and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Sword of Destiny. The film was partly funded and distributed by Netflix in the U.S., but was also produced and distributed by the China Film Group in China. Netflix is already working with Chinese partners on content and distribution.“
What does not help Netflix’s case is the fact that most successful streaming services operating within China’s walled-off internet are funded by the government itself, adding to the list of hurdles that Netflix must vault over before it can even begin operating within the region. Other limitations include regulations like the mandatory government requirement for all broadcasters to host no more than 30 percent of foreign content, something that Netflix already struggles with when it comes to content licensing (as noted in previous examples).

To put things into perspective, it took a juggernaut like Apple Inc. six years just to forge a partnership with China mobile before they were able to launch their products in the region. Similarly, Uber spent an exorbitant amount of time, money and effort to set up its operations in China.
The fact that these companies still took on these challenges and investment risks to break in to these markets, however, stands as a testament to the lucrative nature and the shifting benchmark for successful globalization that Asia represents to the world. And here we have a company that has single-handedly declawed traditional TV and cinema’s monopoly on entertainment, and has transcended into millennial culture like no other brand before it. If there’s anyone that can make lightning strike twice, it’s probably Netflix.",2016-07-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/netflix-password1.png?w=738,"streaming,india,china",The threats and challenges for Netflix in Asia
526,Jon Russell,"Uber has abandoned its ‘land grab’ approach to Southeast Asia and instead switched its focus to new products and services as it begins to see profitability in key markets in the region.
A source at the U.S. company told TechCrunch that its operations are now profitable in Singapore and the Philippines, two of its largest markets for numbers of rides and revenue, with others close behind. Uber declined to respond to repeated requests for comment.
This is an interesting reveal since Uber said last month that it has reached profitability in all of its Western markets. Little is known about its emerging market presence, particularly in Southeast Asia — where it covers 15 cities across Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.
The company entered the region via Singapore more than three years ago, but its most ‘recent’ new country expansion — Vietnam — was two years ago. Since then, its team has been tasked with scaling the business across the region, and now it has been decided that it is time to push on by introducing new services to tighten competition and grow its user base.
Despite a cumulative population of more than 600 million people, Southeast Asia sits in the shadow of China and India. That’s certainly been true for Uber, which has invested multiple billions into China via its Uber China subsidiary, while last summer it revealed a billion-dollar war chest to battle Ola, a $5 billion-valued rival backed by SoftBank, in India.
Southeast Asia, with its population spread across six primary countries with differing currencies, cultures, regulation barriers and languages, was a distant priority. But TechCrunch understands things are changing, with Uber keen to increase its rivalry with Grab, the ride-hailing service that claims 19 million app downloads and 350,000 drivers and is affiliated with Ola, China’s Didi and Lyft.
UberEats, its food-delivery service, its UberPool ride-sharing service, and UberMoto, its bike taxi service, are the three priorities, we understand. UberRush, its courier service, isn’t currently present in Asia but may also be introduced in selected markets before the year is out.
UberEats recently entered Singapore, which became its first launch market in Asia, and the company hinted that it would also bring the service to Bangkok, among other cities.
Singapore was also one of the first ports of call for UberPool, the service that lets passengers ride with others who are headed in the same direction to save costs and ease inner-city congestion. It is also in Indonesian capital Jakarta, while a similar service with shuttle buses launched in Manila, Philippines, this year.
Finally, there’s UberMoto, which hasn’t quite been the success story that Uber had for hoped. Initially launched in Bangkok in February, it was banned from the Thai capital in May, while it has also struggled to find legality in India, the second launch market.
Indonesia is the major focus for UberMoto now, but Uber has plenty of competition. Go-Jek, a local company backed by Sequoia, pioneered motorbike taxis as a service. With more than 200,000 bike drivers on its platform, it goes beyond helping passengers weave Jakarta’s gridlocked cities to get from A to B faster than four wheels. Go-Jek also offers services and food on-demand options. Establishing a motorbike taxi fleet as a platform for additional services is the same play that Uber is opting for, but it is up against a very strong incumbent.
Uber’s push for new services isn’t without other rivalries and resistance. Plenty of food-delivery companies exist in the region. That’s mainly FoodPanda, but Deliveroo recently came to town and there are bespoke companies, like Grain, too.
Then there are those that are financially well-equipped.
Go-Jek seems to be preparing itself for an arms race. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that the startup — which only operates in Indonesia right now — is raising $400 million in fresh capital at a valuation of more than $1 billion. We’ve independently verified that with sources close to negotiations, who told us that the round could be completed within the next couple of weeks.
Go-Jek aside, Grab rivals Uber on motorbike taxis — as well as private cars — and the $1.6 billion-valued company has raised over $650 million to date. Its GrabBike service was also barred from Bangkok, but it continues to do business there as a delivery service for packages and documents. Grab recently disclosed that Indonesia is its largest market in terms of rides, but it did not provide raw figures for how its business is performing.
Grab has also introduced services. GrabHitch, its take on carpooling, launched in Singapore last year and has since expanded to Malaysia, while GrabFood is present in Indonesia. A Grab representative told us that, as of last month, GrabHitch counted 5,000 drivers in those two countries.
That’s not quite all. Grab last week announced plans to introduce a payments platform this year, initially in Indonesia. A payment system that can be used in shops and stores — Grab partnered with Indonesian retail conglomerate Lippo to kick this off — will take it in a different direction as it too seeks to grow its user base through services.",2016-07-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/shutterstock_315926132.jpg?w=738,"grab,indonesia,southeast-asia",Uber focuses on services as it begins to see profits in Southeast Asia
527,Jon Russell,"Sony posted a slim ¥21.2 billion ($205 million) profit for its Q1 2016. That’s down on the ¥82.4 billion profit it carded this time last year, but in general the quarter was a mixed bag of positives and negatives following the impact of cost-cutting initiatives.
We already knew the firm would take somewhat of a hit this quarter after it warned of the impact that the Kumamoto earthquake had on its manufacturing operations nearby. Revenue for the three-month period did reflect that, coming in at ¥1.613 trillion ($15.662 billion), down 11 percent annually.
Other factors besides the quake, Sony said, included the strong yen — a factor Nintendo cited in its earnings yesterday — “the deterioration in investment performance” of its Sony Life business, and the downsizing of its smartphone business, which brought in 33 percent less revenue than one year previous.
There’s a positive side to Sony Mobile’s performance, however — it is now at breakeven. Slowing growth and increased competition in the smartphone market had weighed on Sony’s previous financials, with the smartphone business alone responsible for a $544 million loss in the last financial year. So it is quite notable that its mobile communications division posted a very slender ¥400 million ($4 million) operating profit for the quarter.
That, Sony said, was down to tactical withdraws from tougher markets, as well as a shift away from mid-range phones where competition is fiercest toward higher-end devices with better margins. Restructuring also boosted its home entertainment and sound unit, operating income which increased 85 percent annually to ¥20.2 billion ($197 million) despite revenue dropping seven percent over the period.
Amid those changes, Sony’s PlayStation business, which surpassed 40 million consoles sold to date in March, stood tall.
Sony’s games and network unit — which includes PlayStation — was the stellar performer, accounting for the most revenue across the firm and over 75 percent of total Sony profits. It posted an operating profit of ¥44 billion ($427 million), up 126 percent year-on-year, on revenue of ¥330.4 billion ($3.2 billion) for the quarter, up 14.5 percent.

As mentioned at the top, many Sony units were impacted by the recent earthquake. Its imaging component business took a 26 percent revenue dip year-on-year, the semiconductor business was down 23 percent, and its component business saw revenue fall 23 percent.
Sony Pictures carded a ¥10.6 billion ($103 million) loss which Sony blamed on currencies, despite some strong box office hits like Angry Birds, and revenue in its music business was up 9 percent year-on-year.",2016-07-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/shutterstock_174155708.jpg?w=738,"gaming,japan,sony-mobile,sony",Sony posts $205M profit as downsized mobile business stops bleeding cash
528,Jon Russell,"Flagship phones are often make or break in the mobile industry. Just ask LG. The Korean company’s G5, an ambitious effort at modular devices, continues to weigh on the company’s financial performance this year.
LG announces its Q2 2016 report today and, in short, its mobile business is still some way from breaking even. While LG Electronics — the entire group — posted an operating profit of KRW 584.6 billion ($503.10 million), up 140 percent on the previous year, LG Mobile dragged things down with a KRW 153.5 billion ($132.10 million) loss for the period, though that is a 35 percent improvement on the loss in Q1.
LG shipped 13.9 million devices over its most recent three-month period, that’s higher than the 13.5 million it recorded in the previous quarter but lower than the 14.1 million from one year ago. The mobile business saw overall revenue lag, too. Its Q2 2016 revenue came in at KRW 3.33 trillion ($2.86 billion), an increase on the previous quarter — KRW 2.96 trillion ($2.46 billion) — but down nine percent year-on-year.
The company said the quarter’s loss “reflected increased marketing expenditures and somewhat slow initial sales of G5 smartphone.” LG didn’t give an exact figure for G5 sales, but it did convey its hope that a slate of new lower-end devices — the new V series and more devices within with K and X series — can reverse its fortunes in the next quarter.
LG’s mobile play might not be going as swimmingly as Samsung, which just recorded its most profitable quarter for two years, but it does have other business units to crow about.
This latest quarter’s impressive profit and KRW 14 trillion ($12.05 billion) in revenue — up just 0.5 percent year-on-year but five percent quarter-on-quarter — is predominantly down to its home appliance and air solutions and home entertainment units which pulled in record revenues.
Sure, air conditioning may not be as sexy as smartphones — don’t say that to Xiaomi — but with a KRW 433.7 billion ($373.24 million) profit on revenues of KRW 4.70 trillion ($4.04 billion), the division was LG’s stellar performer courtesy of increased sales in Europe, Korea and the rest of Asia.
Likewise, the home entertainment division carded an operating profit of KRW 356.7 billion ($306.97 million) on revenues of KRW 4.16 trillion ($3.58 billion).",2016-07-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/lg-g5-8-of-14.jpg?w=738,"g5,gt,lg-g5",LG Mobile reports $132M loss as flagship G5 gets off to a slow start
529,Jon Russell,"China took a big step forward today after it announced national guidelines to make ride-hailing services like Uber and Didi Chuxing legal in the country from November.
Drivers from both services and others like Yidao Yongche, majority owned by big-spending LeEco, have operated in fuzzy areas, with police arresting drivers and impounding cars on a seemingly inconsistent basis in China. (As a non-Mandarin speaker, having police stop your Uber or Didi is a truly worrying experience that I’ve lived through.) These rules are still to be adopted by regional and local officials across China, but this is most definitively a step in the right direction for ride-hailing operators.
Sources told Bloomberg that the main features of the rules, which are slated to go into effect from November 1 this year, include:
Some of those stipulations may count against part-time drivers, and it remains unclear how that will impact Uber and Didi’s fleet of cars. In general, though, the duo have both been very vocal in welcoming the regulations — most likely because they are not as extreme as an earlier version of the proposal had been.
Uber called the announcement of the regulations “a welcome step in a country that has consistently shown itself to be forward-thinking when it comes to innovation.”
“Modern regulations can let these services grow while ensuring public safety and protecting consumers,” the company added in a blog post.
Didi Chuxing, the company that is widely acknowledged to be leading Uber in China and recently raised a round in excess of $7 billion, called today’s development “a positive first step.”
“We believe the Rules reflect the government’s open-minded regulatory approach to the mobile car-hailing industry in the broader context of the sharing economy,” it said in a statement.
“As a member of the rideshare community, DiDi welcomes the government’s endorsement and encouragement of the industry and China’s emerging sharing economy. We believe the Rules will usher in a new stage of growth for China’s online ride-booking ecosystem and that DiDi is prepared to meet these new requirements,” the company added.
It isn’t all rosy right off the bat, however. As mentioned, these rules will need to be adopted at both provincial and municipal level across China, and, in order to comply with them, the ride-hailing companies will need to apply and secure new licenses for their businesses.
Didi — which said it will set aside around $15 million for a “development fund” to speed up its integration with regulators, taxi firms and drivers — did voice some concern at the licensing issue process proposed.
Didi claims 14 million drivers and over 300 million active users with 10 million rides per day. Uber China doesn’t issue figures, but Chinese cities account for a number of Uber’s busiest cities on the planet. While those figures are impressive and indicative of how large a market China is, these companies are still scratching the service.
Li Zijian, senior director for international strategy at Didi, recently estimated that his company has reached just 1.1 percent of consumers in the country. Li pegged the on-demand transportation industry in China to be worth $200 billion over the next five years, and legitimizing the industry is surely an important component — for both Didi and Uber.",2016-07-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/traffic-in-china.jpg?w=738,"china,didi-chuxing,uber-china",China issues guidelines to legalize ride-hailing apps like Uber and Didi Chuxing

Ask any retailer or merchant who sells online and they’ll tell you that cash-on-delivery is their number one pain. Not only does it requires the buyer to be home when their delivery arrives — you can hardly expect your neighbor to look after your new product and pick up the tab for it — but managing cash floats, and the added expense of redeliveries is both painful and costly, not to mention impractical.
Cummer told me in an interview that unlike other ‘cash economies’ in Asia, such as Southeast Asia where a minority possess credit cards, Japanese e-commerce buyers favor cash transactions because it is the easiest way to check out at an online store.
“It isn’t because people don’t have a credit card,” he explained. “People just don’t use them when shopping online. That’s because the majority of purchases are made on a mobile device, that form factor plus the fact they are probably on the go, means paying without a credit card is easier.”
Paidy removes the inconvenience of having to whip out your credit card and key in your digits while on the train or bus by instead giving you an account that is tied to your phone number and email address. In that respect, the service operates much like a virtual credit card facility. You pay your bills using Paidy — enter your number and email address then verify via a PIN code — and then clear the debit at the end of the month or via installments if you prefer.

Cummer said that, beyond simplicity, Paidy is also more secure.
“People worry about security,” he said. “We are just using an email address and phone number which isn’t inherently risky.”
He explained that “the majority” of customers opt to settle their bill each month and the structure is very organized, in true Japanese fashion. You’ll be sent an SMS with your Paidy bill on the first of each month, and then have until the 10th to clear it. Merchants are paid on the 20th of each month. Thanks to Japan’s highly organized credit data system — which has proportionally more information per population than even the U.S. — Paidy can assess every user for credit when they sign up, meaning that it also offer longer term payback options for larger ticket purchases or larger debts accrued.
Interestingly, the company said it hasn’t spent a dime on user acquisition, since it sits at the checkout for its partners. It is closing on one million registered users, and has grown its presence by working with large retailers, integrate with shop platforms that power smaller merchant stores, and aligning itself with payment providers.
Beyond being a user-friendly funnel for online purchases, Paidy houses a credit underwriting business and Cummer hinted that it could move into loans and other financial products in the future. That makes a lot of sense given the spending history and other personal details that it holds on its users, and the level of trust that its users have in its services.
For now though, the company is focused on growing its core business and adding logical features such as subscription billing for online services and auto-payment to cover a Paidy debt by default each month.
The company claims over 600,000 merchants but that vanity number includes the long-tail of smaller, independent stores. Some of its larger customers, which drive most of its transaction volume and revenue — both of which are not disclosed at this point — include Adidas, Reebok and Dean & Deluca.
We’ve seen a number of fintech companies pop up across Asia offering personal financing products — e.g. My Wish Marketplaces in India — or virtual credit card style services — e.g. FinAccel in Indonesia — so the market is certainly gaining momentum. Paidy has been going at this problem longer and with more money, but Cummer doesn’t anticipate that it will expand overseas just yet.
“For sure we will” expand overseas over time, he said, “but you have to win at home first.”
While there’s no immediate plan to venture abroad, Cummer hinted that markets with similar economics to Japan — like Korea or Taiwan — could be on the radar when the time comes, but he did also suggest that smaller but growing regions like Southeast Asia could be of interest, too.",2016-07-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/paidy.jpg?w=738,"payments,japan,paidy",Paidy lands $15M Series B to simplify buying online in Japan
531,Jon Russell,"Xiaomi dropped a surprise today when it outed its first laptop — perhaps predictably a cheap rival to Apple’s Macbook — at an event in Beijing, but it also made a more routine reveal: the Redmi Pro.
The Redmi family is Xiaomi’s low-cost device series. Redmi phones are typically around the $150 mark, and they’ve been Xiaomi’s most successful in terms of sales — with over 110 million units shifted in the past three years. (That’s “1.2 units sold every second,” Xiaomi clarified, for those of you who were wondering.)
With the Redmi Pro, the company is looking to bridge the gap between its lower-cost phones and its higher-specced/more expensive Mi range. The Redmi Pro is the first Xiaomi phone to feature an OLED display, measuring 5.5-inches, and two cameras on the rear. Xiaomi said those two lenses — a 13-megapixel Sony IMX258 sensor a 5-megapixel Samsung sensor — work in tandem to help replicate DSLR-style image capture. Xiaomi supplied the below samples.
The device is available in China from August 6 in gold, gray or silver with variable pricing based on specs, including different versions of its MediaTek Helio processor:
(There’s no word on international launch plans right now.)
For an idea of the market gap that Xiaomi is looking to plug here: the Redmi 3 was unveiled in January and is priced at 699 CNY; Xiaomi’s current flagship is the Mi 5, announced in February and priced from 1999 CNY; the deluxe version, the Mi 5 Pro, retails for 2699 CNY.
Xiaomi sold “over 70 million” smartphones last year. That’s impressive given that growth is slowing worldwide, but it came in below internal expectations and there’s more competition than ever in China with Huawei leading the charge. Xiaomi will hope that filling in potential product gaps helps boost its sales in China which, according to reports, have been stagnant.",2016-07-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/redmi-pro_02.jpg?w=738,"china,smartphone,redmi",New Redmi Pro gives Xiaomi’s budget smartphone line a touch of class
532,Jon Russell,"It’s finally here, folks: Nintendo’s quarterly earnings day has never been so anticipated. But the Pokémon phenomenon hasn’t translated into success for the games giant — Nintendo carded a $49 million loss (5.13 billion yen) for Q1 2016 on revenue of $587 million (62 billion yen), down 30 percent.
Nintendo had already explained that Pokémania has little financial impact on its business, despite taking its valuation past $40 billion in recent weeks. The game launched after this quarter, it’s important to note, so it is not reflected in this earnings report — it was its Wii U business that cut deepest for the April-June period. Nintendo sold 50 percent less of the console than one year previous — just 220,000 units — while it also suggested that a stronger Yen had an impact given that close to three-quarters of its sales are from outside of Japan.
The Wii U looks to have had its days in the sun, but Nintendo has a number of new irons in the fire.
The Nintendo NX, its next flagship console, is scheduled to launch in March 2017 and, if recent reports are to be believed, it’ll be a high-powered portable device that Nintendo will hope appeals to a new-generation of gamers.
Nintendo also has potential on mobile, having released its first iOS and Android game this year. Revenue from Miitomo, which has seen its popularity shrink of late despite once having 10 million users, hasn’t been amazing but it’s a start. Nintendo reported 1.65 billion yen ($15.6 million) in revenue from smart devices products and IP licensing, which includes Miitomo.
Miitomo is a very Nintendo-y game that most likely has very limited appeal to newer audiences, but the firm said today it has at least two new titles coming to mobile this year — Fire Emblem and Animal Crossing — which will likely raise revenue from smartphones.
Then there is Pokémon Go. While Nintendo’s equity is Niantic Labs is 13 percent, after it invested last year, and it has a 32 percent holding in The Pokémon Company, there’s still money to be made there. In particular, the game has just begun allowing “sponsored locations” — initially with McDonald’s in Japan — and there is a $30 wearable device on its way, albeit with a later launch date of September.
There’s also a miniature version of its iconic NES console. At $60, it isn’t likely to change Nintendo’s financials single-handedly, but it is one of a number of projects that is making Nintendo more relevant again and that does bode well for the future.

533,Jon Russell,"A number of Australia’s largest banks have come together to challenge Apple and its Apple Pay service in the country.
Apple’s digital payments solution landed in Australia in April with Samsung Pay and Android Pay following thereafter, but the banks are unhappy that — unlike the latter two services — they are unable to rival Apple Pay by offering their own digital payments service for iPhone-owning customers. That’s because Apple outlaws third-party digital payment solutions on iOS, instead preferring to integrate banks and payment providers into Apple Pay.
National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac — the one, two and three lenders respectively — and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank filed an application with the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission seeking permission to collectively negotiate with Apple to enable their respective services without violating anti-competition laws.
Just one major bank, ANZ (Australia and New Zealand Bank), partnered with Apple for Apple Pay in Australia and, unsurprisingly, it isn’t part of this complaint.
Here’s the summary of the submission, which was first reported by Reuters:
Apple did not reply to our request for comment.
This appears to be the first action of this kind against Apple and Apply Pay. The U.S. firm has generally had success bringing banking partners to the service. It began with just six in the U.S. where it now covers 2,500 bank locations, while in China the 12 partners it launched with in February is now at 19.
Apple Pay is currently available in nine countries: the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, China, Singapore, Switzerland, France and Hong Kong. Back in May, Jennifer Bailey, VP of Apple Pay, told us that the company was working “rapidly” to launch in more countries, and a number of those launches have occurred since her comments.",2016-07-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/apple-pay-barclays.jpg?w=580,"payments,australia",Australia’s largest banks unite to challenge Apple Pay
534,Jon Russell,"Finally, Rocket Internet has managed to sell Jabong, its fashion e-commerce site in India, after more than a year of speculation. Myntra, the fashion portal which itself was acquired by Flipkart, has stepped up and bought its rival in a $70 million deal announced today.
The deal is all in cash but it is not completed yet, it is expected to close within Q3 2016.
Flipkart CEO Binny Bansal and executive chairman Sachin Bansal both confirmed the deal on Twitter, with Sachin keen to “make history” with Jabong.
Global Fashion Group (GFG), the umbrella company that runs Rocket Internet’s fashion-focused e-commerce businesses worldwide, explained in an announcement that it spent months deliberating on which suitor to sell the Jabong business to:
India’s Economic Times reported that Myntra/Flipkart beat out a range of competitors, including Snapdeal and Future Group, but plenty of others have been linked with a deal in the past.
Jabong was once thought to own one-quarter of India’s fashion e-commerce market, making it the chief threat to Myntra. Back in 2014, Amazon was reportedly nearing a $1.2 billion deal to buy the company before backing out months later. Alibaba, Flipkart, Paytm and countless others have been linked with deals since then as Jabong failed to maintain its position in the market.
The (inevitable) sell-off comes amid challenging times for its parent company.
GFG raised $365 million at a drastically reduced valuation of $1.1 billion last week. We reported at the time that the group had met with as many as 90 investors and yet failed to land capital outside of its existing investor base. GFG sold off two business units belonging to Zalora, Jabong’s sister company in Southeast Asia, earlier this year, and we wrote that the sale of Jabong and other unwanted businesses is likely to happen now that this new financing is secured.
Jabong’s finances haven’t been too impressive of late. The company carded a €60 million ($66 million) loss for 2015 with €211 million ($232 million) in GMV for the year. During its most recent quarter of business, Jabong’s losses narrowed to €11.9 million ($13.1 million) from €16.3 million ($17.9 million) one year before, but its margins nearly halved from 59 percent to 36.5 percent over the same period. That shift, which GFG put down to fewer discounts, was presumably to get the business into shape for a sale.
Our source suggested that there could be other business units within GFG sold off, although that might be country-based operations like Zalora’s previous deal and not entire companies like Jabong.
“Through the sale of Jabong, we are achieving a milestone in our strategy to refocus and invest in our core markets that show both, significant growth and revenue potential but also a clear and predictable path to profitability,” GFG CEO Romain Voog said in a statement.",2016-07-25,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/screenshot-2016-07-26-13-43-33.png?w=738,"e-commerce,myntra,flipkart,jabong",Rocket Internet’s Jabong sold to Flipkart-owned rival Myntra for $70M
535,Jon Russell,"Singapore-based media company E27 has closed a SG$3 million (US$2.2 million) Series A round as it looks to redevelop its tech-focused news website and events business following some tough times.
The company previously raised seed rounds, the most recent being a $650,000 raise last summer, and there had been talk of new financing for the past month or so. Now the company has confirmed its raise from a bevy of new investors each of whom is involved in early-stage tech. The round was led by China-based TechTemple Group with participation from Linear Venture (also China), Indonesia’s Convergence Ventures and Singapore-based duo Venturecraft and venture builder Spacemob.
E27 is best known in Southeast Asia for its news site — e27.co — and its long-running Echelon events business. First founded in 2007, it has endured a rough past year which included making layoffs and general restructuring. With new money in the bank, though, E27 CEO and co-founder Mohan Belani plans to make new hires across the company to grow the editorial and events teams, as well as strengthen newer businesses which include a job listings service, Crunchbase-style database and ‘marketplace’ where third-parties offer bundled deals.
“The objective here is to be an ecosystem player not just media,” he told me in a phone interview. “Media was our first foray but we realized that, as the company grows, challenges evolve. Our database and marketplace come together to serve the greater community — pair them with events, and you get a nice online-to-offine mix.”

Belani said that E27 will work with its new investors in a fairly direct manner. He hinted that could mean events in China in sync with TechTemple Group, which provides a range of services to help startups including co-working spaces and incubation services, or Convergence Ventures, which is focused on early-stage investments in Indonesia. Likewise, the other investors have a dedicated early-stage presence which could also mean more potential for tie-ins.
“A lot of the focus will go to events and online, we’re looking at being more heavily focused on the Southeast Asia market [because it is] the area we know best and work we know best,” Belani added, noting that the tech communities in China and India are increasingly looking at Southeast Asia’s potential.
Tech In Asia is E27’s big rival in terms of editorial and the events business. Tech In Asia has raised nearly $7 million to date, including a $4 million round last year, and it has more than 70 staff working on its business, which also includes Techlist, another Crunchbase-esque analytics service for Asia which graduated Y Combinator. Those two aside, other blogs that focus on tech news across Southeast Asia include Digital News Asia and Deal Street Asia.",2016-07-25,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/echelon-asia-summit-2016-in-singapore-organised-by-e27-echelon-top100-winner-softinn-with-finalists-and-judges.jpg?w=738,"linear-venture,mohan-belani,e27",Southeast Asia tech media company E27 raises $2.2M
536,Sarah Perez,"On the fence about whether your child is old enough for their own smartphone? A new app called Luna Launcher can help you warm to the idea, by offering a simple way to limit access to select apps and actions, including who they can call or text – a list you can restrict to family members, for example. Of course, because of the way it needs to interact with your phone’s operating system in order to restrict access, Luna Launcher is only available on Android.
One of Android’s advantages over iPhone is that it permits the use of launchers, which allow you to entirely customize the Android experience, whether that’s access to apps, as with these kid launchers, or just with new themes and layouts. iPhone, on the other hand, requires parents to look down apps and other activities using parental controls.
Today, there are a good handful of kid-friendly launchers for Android smartphones. However, some are focused on littler children or providing access to educational content or games, instead of just being a smart utility.

Luna Launcher, on the other hand, is appropriate for toddlers to preteens, as all it does is lock down access to apps and actions, like who they can call and text. In other words, if you don’t want your 10-year old spending all day texting friends, but want them to have a way to reach mom or dad in an emergency, Luna could be a good fit.
To get started, you create your child’s profile, pick the apps you’ll allow them to use, then choose the shortcuts you want to add, like those to message mom, call dad, etc., by selecting from your contact list. These actions can also including calls and texts from third-party apps like WhatsApp, Skype or Messenger.
When setup is complete, you can further customize the launcher experience by turning on or off the weather, picking a color for your theme, or choosing to disable access to the status bar and notification area.  You can also set daily quotes in Luna, and track usage.

One especially nice feature is the custom YouTube player that’s built-in.
From the settings, you can configure very limited access to YouTube by adding only individual videos to the launcher’s homescreen, playlists, or favorite YouTube channels. This prevents the child from being able to surf across YouTube, where they might encounter more adult content. (You could also add the YouTube Kids app as one of your applications, if you’d rather not take the time to customize access so specifically.)
“The product comes from my real problem,” explains Hoa Le, one of Luna’s two indie developers, based in Vietnam. He says when he bought a new tablet, he decided to hand down his old Nexus 7 tablet to his son since.
“A few months later, I found out that my 5 year-old son spent too much time on the device, mostly playing games. I was struggling to find an app that helps me to set up a kind of ‘parental control’ on the device,” he says.

He and a college friend decided to build Luna as a side project for their own use, which is why the app is currently free.
Unfortunately, during testing, I found that after exiting the parental control screens, Luna would sometimes stop responding to presses. This was only fixed by rebooting the phone. Others don’t seem to have the same issue, so your mileage may vary. Hopefully, it’s a bug that will be addressed in a future update.
Luna Launcher is live now on Google Play and will be available on the Amazon Appstore soon.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/luna-launcher.jpg?w=738,"kids,android-apps,apps",Luna Launcher turns your Android phone into a kid-friendly device
537,Jordan Crook,"Drizly, the service that lets you order alcohol online, has today announced a major transition of the company with the launch of its marketplace.
The Drizly marketplace will let any retailer integrate with the Drizly software to generate extra sales. And for the user, the marketplace will allow more pricing transparency and flexibility.
The old Drizly, by comparison, would use a set of criteria to connect a user’s purchase order with the fastest delivery time from a vendor nearby. But not all consumers are concerned with speed, which is where the marketplace comes into play.
For the past 2.5 years, Drizly has been working quietly to be able to seamlessly integrate with as many point-of-sale systems as possible. As it stands now, the company can quickly tap into over 75 different POS systems, giving Drizly near-immediate access to a store’s entire inventory.
Considering that many liquor stores are small businesses, it’s necessary that Drizly take the time and effort to make each POS work with the platform.
But creating a liquor, wine and spirits marketplace on the internet is harder than just checking off a long list of POS integrations.
With thousands of different products on the market, Drizly was also tasked with the job of standardizing information around these products. More than 3 percent (roughly 1,500) of all U.S. wine and liquor stores are currently on the Drizly platform.
This means that Drizly has to take all the information it sources, across 75 POS/inventory systems, and turn it into something legible to the consumer.
“People have been thinking of us as an on-demand company,” said founder and CEO Nick Rellas. “But what we’ve been working on is much bigger than quick delivery. After our work since launch, standardizing a market that 50 sets of laws for 50 different states on the internet, I would say we’re more of a data company.”
With the new marketplace structure, users can not only compare price between retailers, but they can choose between different delivery methods, too. For example, a user searching for a rare whiskey can choose to have it delivered tomorrow for a cheaper price than immediate delivery. Or, users who’d prefer to skip the wait and pick up the booze themselves can elect that option.

Along with added transparency to the user, the new Drizly will also offer a wider reach for retailers. Stores that couldn’t handle the demand to deliver within an hour on the old Drizly will now have more options to offer consumers, including later delivery, pick-up, etc.
That said, retailers will also be moving into slightly more competitive territory, as they’ll have to compete with the prices of other retailers in their area, instead of blindly taking the orders that the old Drizly sent their way.
“We tell our retailers that the Drizly storefront should be treated just like the brick-and-mortar storefront,” said Rellas. “Whatever makes your store great, whether it’s price or selection or speed of delivery, you should it on Drizly, too.”
Drizly makes money by charging a licensing fee to retailers using the software, as opposed to taking a per-transaction slice of the pie.
Today’s launch comes in conjunction with the opening of the San Francisco market.

538,Jordan Crook,"The AOL Alto team is today delivering a new version of the product that may make some of your biggest email woes disappear.
Enter the Alto Dashboard.
With the latest version of AOL Alto, users can choose between a regular inbox view and a dashboard view of their communications. Dashboard view surfaces contextually relevant information right to the top of the page and offers the ability to take action on those emails.
Let’s say you booked a flight to South Korea two months ago, and your flight leaves tomorrow. Rather than scrolling back through your inbox to find your ticket confirmation, Alto will serve that email up to you as soon as you’re able to check in to your flight. When it’s time to hit the airport, Alto will again serve up that email with the opportunity to retrieve your ticket QR code, without you ever having the need to open up the United Airlines app.
When you land in South Korea, an email with your hotel confirmation will pop to the top of the dashboard with the option to order an Uber straight from the airport to the hotel, with one click of a button.
Alto determines what should be in the Dashboard through an algorithm, but users can tell the system what should or should not be in the dashboard to help it get smarter.
Emails that are deemed worthy of the dashboard, however, don’t look like ordinary emails. Alto transforms the content of those messages into “Cards”, which enables those same integrated actions like checking in for a flight, ordering an Uber, or getting directions to a destination.
Alongside the Dashboard and its Cards, Alto is also introducing Stacks. Stacks are categorized inboxes that put various email verticals all in one place, from travel to shopping to social.
Alto is available as a native app on both iOS and Android, and works across a variety of browsers. The company says it is considering plans to build a native desktop app.
AOL Alto will remain free to users, but there is an opportunity down the line to generate revenue off of brands who wish to engage more directly with consumers via email, according to the team.

539,Sarah Perez,"Amid an increasing number robo-investors like Betterment, Stash, and Robinhood, a new San Francisco-based fintech startup called Grow is entering the fray to compete based on investment type, not only financial returns. While the app operates much like its rivals in terms of making it easier for novice investors quickly build their portfolios, its biggest differentiator is that it focuses only on environmentally sustainable, socially responsible companies with good governance.
This makes the app something that may appeal to younger users, who are typically more selective about where they choose to spend their money.
For example, Nielsen studies have found that the majority of millennials make sustainability a shopping priority. Grow aims to find out if they make it a priority when they begin investing, too.
The startup was founded by Head of Product Michael DeMaria, who has a background in finance, and CTO Anthony Randazzo. It’s led by CEO Doug Heske, a Bay Area finance vet who joined in March 2016.
To determine where to invest, Grow has developed its own proprietary database and analytics tool, Grow Analytics, to identify those investments that respect certain values, like environmental, social and governance, while also minimizing portfolio risk. It seeks out investments across sectors, industries and assets classes, too, in order to offer a balanced and diversified portfolio. That means you can use Grow as your primary robo-investing app, not as a supplemental product.

To use the app, you first tell it what sort of values you most care about – like the environment or social responsibility, for example. You can add money to Grow or schedule a monthly deposit to fund your account by linking your bank, then Grow will automatically invest in your personalized portfolio on your behalf.
You can see your investments’ growth right on the app’s homepage, displayed as a circle that shows both the present and future value.

 
To generate revenue, Grow charges 0.25% for management fees through the app. However, its business model also includes other means of generating revenue outside the app, as well. For example, Grow’s full service asset management arm, Grow Capital Management, charges management fees between .25% and .75%. Also, it licenses Grow Analytics to investment and research institutions for a monthly fee.
The app itself soft-launched back in February on the iTunes App Store for testing purposes and feedback with some 350 users. As of this week, a revamped and redesigned version went live, and is now available to everyone.
The startup has been self-funded up until last month, but is currently raising $3 million in seed funding in a round that’s only partially complete. So far, two major California-based family offices have committed capital.
Grow is a free download on the iTunes App Store. ",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-29-at-10-26-56-am.png?w=738,"investing,fintech,finance,apps",Grow launches its app for socially responsible investing
540,Josh Constine,"Robinhood says it will never charge commissions to trade stocks, but the $66 million-funded startup is finally ramping up monetization with the launch of “Robinhood Gold” premium features. For $10 per month, users can skip the three-day waiting period with instant deposits and reinvesting, trade 30 minutes before and 2 hours after the market is open, and borrow up to double the money in their account to trade on margin with leverage.
The basic zero-fee trading appeals to younger, less wealthy, less experienced traders who make small investments where the $7-plus commission fees charged by competitors like Scottrade and E*Trade could eradicate their potential gains.
That’s nearly as much as Robinhood charges for its Gold subscription, which could lure veteran traders from those services. That could in turn bring in larger balances which fuel the original way Robinhood makes money — interest on cash people store in their account.

“Robinhood Gold is to our core product as Amazon Prime is to Amazon” says Robinhood co-CEO Baiju Bhatt [Disclosure: We were friends in college]. “It makes it better in a consistent way for people who use the product a lot.” At first, Robinhood Gold will roll out to about 15% of the app’s user base, and extend from there to other qualified users after testing.
Gold users won’t have to wait three days for the ACH transfers to process when they fund their Robinhood balance from their bank account, or when they sell stock and want to buy more stock with the proceeds. Pre- and post-bell trading gives smaller investors an option to trade on after-hours news like earnings reports. Trading from 9am to 9:30am when markets open and from 4pm to 6pm after they close was typically reserved for big institutional investors.
The most important premium feature, though, is additional buying power. which Bhatt calls “basically a credit card for the stock market.” As long as users have at least $2,000 in their account, they can borrow up to 2X that amount for $10 per month and trade with it.

Robinhood is also selling higher-priced subscriptions with more buying power: $4000 for $20/month, $6000 for $30/month, $10,000 for $50/month, and buying power up to $50,000 at a 5% interest rate. There are some restrictions on risky buying behavior, so you can’t dump thousands into a newly IPO’d company, leveraged ETFs, or stocks priced under $3.00 because they’re too volatile.
Now the question is whether traders interested in these advanced options are ready for a mobile-only trading app. Bhatt expects Robinhood Gold will be the startup’s primary revenue source.
The income could help Robinhood make good on the $66 million in funding it’s taken from Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, GV (Google Ventures), Index, Slow Ventures, and celebs like Nas, Snoop Dogg, and Jared Leto. Robinhood is looking like one of the top portfolio companies for Rothenberg Ventures, the disgraced fund that recently changed its name to Frontier Tech Ventures.
Founded in 2013 by two Stanford grads who’d built high-frequency trading tech for big hedge funds, Robinhood now has over one million registered users. It’s handled $12 billion in transactions and saved people over $200 million in commission fees. The app is hockey-sticking, with transaction volume doubling just since June.
Yet Bhatt laughs that “The oldest question people have about Robinhood? ‘How are you ever gonna make money?'” The startup had until now focused on democratizing stock trading by making it affordable to everyone, not earning money for itself.
Robinhood’s mobile nature makes it tempting to impulse-buy stocks which could get people in trouble if they’re trading on borrowed credit via Gold. Bhatt is cognizant of the risk, saying “We want to help people make decisions that they’re comfortable with and that they understand.” Otherwise, who would want to come back to an app where they lost a ton of dough?
And since Robinhood is storing people’s money, the startup has to be extraordinarily vigilant when it comes to security. A breach could scare customers away to more established brokerages.
Down the line, Robinhood plans to build a web product to complement its mobile-first apps, and will keep adding features to Robinhood Gold. For now, it’s software will keep eating stock trading, replacing brick-and-mortar brokerage offices with apps, and sharing the savings with its users.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gold-iphone-shot1.png?w=738,"stock-trading,robinhood",Free stock trade app Robinhood monetizes with $10/month to buy on credit
541,Lora Kolodny,"Boston-based Lose It! (incorporated as FitNow Inc.) has released a new beta feature today called Snap It within its weight loss and calorie tracking app.
As is easily guessed by the name, Snap It beta lets users take photos of their daily meals and snacks to automatically log them and derive approximate calorie counts.
For now, users will be able to open the Lose It! app, pick a meal-type (breakfast, lunch, dinner or snack), take a photo of their food, submit and wait briefly for Snap It to analyze it.
Snap It will present users with a few best guesses of what food was portrayed in the submitted pic. Users can then confirm the food seen in the photo, and add more detail.
For example if they’ve uploaded a pic of sushi, Snap It may recognize “sushi roll,” but not know if it contained salmon, or just cucumbers, or whether the roll was made with brown instead of white rice.
After labeling the contents of their meal, users are prompted to confirm an approximate serving size, and the meal is officially logged.
Lose It! built Snap It as a neural network that gets smarter over time, or better able to identify foods in photos and their portions automatically.
Because the system is still in beta, CEO Charles Teague says, it’s more like Tesla’s driver assistive technology today, than the Tesla vehicles of the future that promise to be fully self-driving.
Lose It built its initial model for Snap It beta using something called the Food 101 dataset, which defines 101 food categories and contains 101,000 images that map to these categories.
Lose It claims that Snap It beta achieves 87.3% to 97.1% accuracy already within that data set. And as users contribute more images and descriptions, Snap It should become even more precise and accurate.
While logging meals with photos on social media is common, Lose It is taking on a more complicated endeavor. It wants to deliver accurate assessments of meals seen in users’ photos, but also help them count calories as precisely as possible, and even figure out nutritional information to improve their diets.
Lose It!’s goal is to help its users lose weight or maintain a healthy weight.
Teague said, “Ultimately we want to make understanding your diet as simple as Fitbit made understanding your activity. Snap It is going to give us the opportunity to reach a whole new set of users that may have found tracking frustrating or might’ve never even tried it because it seemed too time consuming. When tracking is a simple as snapping a picture, it becomes accessible to nearly everyone.”
The company’s new Snap It! initiative is competing with food recognition technologies like SRI International’s Ceres project, and Google’s IM2 Calories.
Though ultimately, FitNow Inc. could put others’ AI systems to work to power Lose It! features as well.",2016-09-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/lose-it_stills_in-app_4x3-ratio_orange.jpg?w=738,lose-it,Lose It launches Snap It to let users count calories in food photos
542,Romain Dillet,"French startup Lydia raised $7.8 million (€7 million) from New Alpha AM and Oddo & Cie in order to expand to other European countries. The startup lets you easily pay back your friends without any fee using a mobile app — among other things. Think about it as a sort of Venmo for France.
While Lydia has only been available in France, with today’s funding round, the company plans to launch in other European markets. With 500,000 users in France, it’s time to look at other countries.
Lydia plans to launch in the U.K., Germany and Spain during the first half of 2017. Lydia also has some ambitious goals, including reaching 3 million users in two years.
Other startups in other European countries also provide peer-to-peer payment services — for instance, Revolut in the U.K. and Cookies in Germany. So Lydia will have to expand quickly before these local competitors become too ubiquitous.
But Lydia doesn’t plan to stop at geographical expansions. Just a few weeks ago, the company introduced a good old plastic card to pay in millions of retail stores. It’s a regular MasterCard, but you can customize it to your needs in the Lydia app.
Transactions appear instantly, you can block and unblock online payments, foreign payments, ATM withdrawals and more. Similarly, you can set different payment limits and all changes are reflected instantly.
When I talked with Cyril Chiche about this new product feature, he had an interesting take on the future of consumer fintech startups. According to him, all fintech startups start with a simple product and add features that make them compete with all other fintech startups.

543,John Mannes,"Skymind, a company developing an open-source deep-learning library for Java, along with tools for implementation, today closed $3 million in financing from Tencent, SV Angel, GreatPoint Ventures, Mandra Capital and Y Combinator. Skymind was previously part of Y Combinator’s Winter 2016 batch and has taken money from Joe Montana’s Liquid 2 Ventures and a number of other prominent angels.
Chris Nicholson, the company’s co-founder and CEO, decided to start the company after he noticed the steady stream of deep-learning researchers leaving the halls of academia for the six- and seven-figure salaries of large tech companies. With human capital becoming a finite resource, the challenge quickly became about helping companies leverage existing resources to play in the world of deep learning.
Eighty percent of the world’s programmers are versed in Java programming. Nicholson, and his co-founder Adam Gibson, began to question whether it would be possible to build a library that would let those developers put their skills to work on AI challenges. This idea became Deeplearning4j, and it remains the core of Skymind.
Nicholson describes his company as the Red Hat of deep-learning. Red Hat, a company that produces open-source software for the enterprise community, has grown to become an over $14 billion company.
For startups that produce software for the Fortune 100, the pressure to create in open-source has never been higher. Not only does open-source allow companies to stay competitive, it allows the startups producing the technologies to hire the best engineers.
Skymind employs 15 people, but they are not all centralized in a single opulent Palo Alto or SoMa headquarters like most startups these days. Instead, members of the team operate out of Japan, South Korea and Australia. Many of these engineers came directly from the Skymind open-source community, where they were working on their own challenges with the library. Of course, the company does have a small SoMa headquarters, but it’s not nearly as integral to the core business.
$42 billion French telecom Orange SA is already using Skymind and its Skymind Intelligence Layer (SKIL) to build and deploy production code for deep-learning projects. SKIL facilitates the digital interactions between Skymind and existing tools like Hadoop. Nicholson also notes interest from medium-size companies in traditional data-rich sectors like financial services and e-commerce.
One sector that will not be leveraging Skymind is the top layer of large tech companies that have poured billions of dollars into developing their own open-source technologies. Google’s TensorFlow, Amazon’s DSSTNE and Baidu’s Paddle have all found their way into a number of external applications. Importantly, however, none of these tools are built for Java.
Skymind libraries were downloaded 22 thousand times last month, and that number is growing at 17 percent month over month. Nicholson wants the company to continue to develop tools for  data scientists. These tools could eventually include packages to better democratize access to reinforcement learning, a categorization of reward-based machine learning, for existing businesses.
Other investors in the party round include Muse’s Matthew Bellamy, Hemi Ventures, JPush’s Chris Lo, Wei Guo, Rising Tide Fund, Ullas Naik’s Streamlined Ventures, Soma Capital, Lookout’s Kevin Mahaffey, GMO Venture Partners, FundersClub, S2 Capital, former head of Google search Amit Singhal and Google News creator Krishna Bharat.",2016-09-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-545863031.jpg?w=738,"java,artificial-intelligence",Skymind raises $3M to bring its Java deep-learning library to the masses

They also pair participating startups with an industry-relevant mentor to help bring the startup to market. This year, the eleven of the twelve startups received a seed investment of $40K from the ERA.
One such notable alumni of the program is Public Stuff, a software company that assists clients with managing complaints — currently, they assist Burj Khalifia building management with customer complaints.
This year, the startups range everywhere from B2B marketplace offerings, a cybersecurity platform and yes, even a connected dog house. Here’s the rundown on each company and what they’re all about.

A DevOps (developmental operations) platform, that is designed to help software developers build, rollout and manage their containers through the cloud. Caylent is about making it easier for programmers at a company to build out and maintain new programs and projects, essentially becoming single-unit powerhouses.
Caylent’s pipeline includes testing, building and deploying applications, including server management. Partnered with Docker for their container technology, thus enabling 1-click deployments of new code, monitoring and automated testing — turning a company programmer into a DevOps machine.
Microsoft was also noted during their presentation as having invested cloud infrastructure in Caylent, adding to their potential appeal as a go-to solution in the field.

An enterprise cybersecurity platform for secure communications that we’ve covered before. Aimed to target the increasing need for secured team communication and file sharing, suited for finance, health, legal and government — and yes, even a publication like TechCrunch.
ClearChat is looking for Slack’s lunch, essentially. Every other week or so, a major communication platform gets breached, and personal information is compromised. ClearChat wants to end that practice, while also being a better communication platform for teams who want to keep what they’re communicating about private and secure.

A B2B marketplace that aims to go after the antiquated international ocean freight industry. CoLoadX is about modernizing ocean freight shipping, with the end-goal to not only save on shipping costs, but become the de factor way of doing shipping at scale.
Currently, some of their initial clients that range from New York City to Dubai, so they’ve covered a few seas and oceans, already.
Lead by Fauad Shariff, Petere Miner and Salima Fassell, the trio are dead-set on bringing new life to the shipping container industry by not only finding the most cost-effective offers for clients, but doing it through the internet — which is fresh, for an industry that is mostly reliant on fax machines and phone calls. Just how many clients who think they’re the right approach to this dilemma remains to be seen.
We had these guys at Disrupt NY this year, but here’s the rundown: secure, temperature controlled dog parking, by the minute. Not particularly illuminating.
The goal of Dog Parker is allowing stores to have a secure dog house on their premises, specifically Dog Parker’s. The business perspective is that retail locations will attract dog owners who otherwise wouldn’t be allowed within the store, usually due to health regulations, and thus will drive further drive business, no matter the industry.
Meanwhile, the real idea is that dog owners will trust Dog Parker with the life and security of their dog, by locking it in the secured, anti-bacterial and temperate-controlled housing, which can be reserved in advance via an app, should the owner know they’re going to be in a certain area.
Problem is, not one of my German Shepherds would ever fit in it.

A startup founded by David Roger and Chris Benedict, Felix Gray is a startup that is conscious about eye health in the 21st century, for both adult millennials and today’s children. Selling eye glasses aimed towards protecting the eyes from the blue light spectrum that causes eye strain and glare of screens (tech which is eerily similar to Gunnar Optiks), including preventing eye strain, which in turn is said to cause dry eyes and ultimately, poor sleep.
After all, everyone stares at screens for hours and Felix Gray’s argument is that by providing an affordable solution for reducing eye strain for all of us who stare at screens for hours. Felix Gray glasses cost $95 with blue light filter or $75 without.
Problem is, this is a temporary solution to a problem that may very well be fixed from the hardware, not optical, end.

Founded by Catie Cole, Dae Lim and Harry Lee, First Round on the House is a marketing platform designed for alcoholic beverage brands in New York City.
Its aim is to carry the marketing influence of beverage brands to consumers, through an iOS app. If you like Absolut vodka, but never drink it, then Absolut could make you like their vodka.
Brands make use of the app by targeting a specific spot (a bar) for drinkers. Drinkers (the user), make use of the app on their end by specifying a drink they’re in the mood for, in a location of the user’s choosing It’s through this connection that beverage brands can target the user and provide the drink of choice — on the house, as part of a tasting. It doesn’t take long to realize that people like to have free drinks, and might even be more predisposed towards a brand that got them to try a beverage for free, that also turned out to be to their tastes.
Bullet Bourbon and Ketel One Vodka are two of FROTH’s new partners, with plans for non-alcoholic brands to join the app later this year.

InkHunter is an augmented reality platform that is aimed towards improving mobile apps overall, since AR is noted to be slow, or inconsistent on mobile.
Founded by Oleksandra Rohachova and Pavlo Razumovskyi, inkHunter allows the user to preview tattoos on their body using AR — thus fulfilling one such user-case of their mark-based augmented reality technology. By drawing a smiley face where the tattoo is desired on the body, the inkHunter app will recognize the doodle and transform it to a tattoo on-screen, using AR.
So far, inkHunter has scored more than 2.5 million App Store downloads. In their presentation, their hope is to go beyond the tattoo, and make use of their AR tech within the e-commerce, health and gaming industries.
A data science-driven health startup, founded by Arif Sorathia and Brett Adelman, for sufferers of chronic and autoimmune conditions, like lupus.
Karate Health is an app that combines peer relationships, medication/side effect tracking and education materials, the user will enter their prescribed medications, experienced symptoms and some required personal info (like age and gender). Karate Health’s end-goal to educate patients about their conditions, while also giving health care providers a more cost-effective way of learning about their patients’ conditions and symptoms, to better improve research and clincial trials.
In terms of being viable, Karate Health noted in its presentation that it’s on track to helping more than 1,500 suffers of lupus, and soon will expand its expertise to helping those with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Founded by Mike Hartman, Koa is a software platform for buyers and sellers of mortgage loans. An end-to-end deal and loan management system, it’s aimed towards modernizing an industry that hasn’t been up-to-date ever since the ’08 financial crisis.
Koa’s current and future clients get to manage, analyze and execute their loan investments using a online control panel, from a computer, naturally. Koa’s claim to relevance is that Koa’s out-of-the-box software implementation allows the user to benefit from cost savings and increased profits. Not terribly exciting at first glance, but with the potential increase of clients, Koa’s ultimate vision is to allow trades between clients — and that may prove useful.

Pairprep: a education startup and platform, powered by AI and founded by Sean Lanning. By taking a picture or uploading a PDF, a teacher (or parent) can create assignments, and adapt those assignments to the individual needs of their students.
Collaboration tools exist so that multiple teachers (or parents) can build better, more enriching assignments, ultimately competing with the staple education textbook publishers. Pairprep’s argument is that a team of 50,000 algebra teachers can produce better assignments for students than a few specialists at heavy-hitters like Pearson and McGraw-Hill.
With 358,000 users, PairPrep thinks it has the strength and knowledge (from its library of teachers) to disrupt that industry. At first, teachers don’t pay for the basic features of the software, with the goal of getting schools to pay for the premium features (like individualized help for students) on their behalf.

Founded by Houtan Fanisalek and Kenneth Kruger, SensorKit is an activity and gesture recognition platform. Their argument is using machine learning to improve the tracking from wearables like the Apple Watch and Moto 360 smartwatches. Thankfully, this isn’t about producing new hardware, but improving the sensors in existing wearables.
SensorKit is the brains behind an app built by the same folks called YouMove, available for Android and iOS, which uses the platform to automatically detect user’s actions including bench presses, squats, rows counting reps, set and resting times — all coached to the user, using auditory feedback.
Previously just an iPhone app, SensorKit will take advantage of the newly-unlocked sensors in the Apple Watch, so YouMove will launch on the Apple Watch, come October 7th.

Co-founded by Julien Newman, Turnout.ai is a B2B analytics platform, providing companies with modernized public opinion polls.
Gathering public sentiment data manually from pollsters and sign-up forms is a chore, so Turnout.ai scans those forms and types them into PDFs and searchable data.  A “grassroots company with a grassroots app”, a pollster takes a picture of the lists and collected data, where Turnout.ai digitizes the data and can email supporters regarding the cause you have, which was outlined when signing-up.
The first client added to Turnout.ai’s roster is Uber, which uses only the analytics engine (not the whole app) to find qualitative data from the data quantified by Turnout.ai’s analytics, thus in some ways avoid public backlash. Yes, in essence they’re mining conversations to assist companies and personal agendas — take that as you may.",2016-09-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dsc_2782.jpg?w=738,entrepreneurs-roundtable-accelerator,The 12 startups making their case at ERA Demo Day

546,Lora Kolodny,"Today, goTenna is taking pre-orders for their new product, a device called the goTenna Mesh that lets smartphone users text and share their GPS locations, off-grid and across miles of terrain.
The new device works like goTenna’s flagship product did in that it can be used where normal cellular, satellite or wifi services are not available. And like the company’s flagship goTenna, users pair the device to their phones using bluetooth, then use goTenna’s app to create and send messages.
But what’s different is that the goTenna Mesh sends communications across publicly available UHF frequencies, and it meshes.
The new hardware doesn’t have an external antennae —that means it is compact, and allows the company to sell the goTenna Mesh internationally.
Daniela Perdomo, goTenna’s co-founder and CEO said:
“Sometimes you cannot plug into traditional communications systems because they are not available, like after a storm, or are unreliable at a crowded event, or unaffordable, say if you are traveling or living on a restricted budget. So we’re building grassroots, bottoms-up communications systems.”
The startup also launched its premium, goTenna Plus service today, which gives users access to offline topographic maps, read receipts for messages they send, trip statistics, automated location tracking and the ability to relay messages across traditional SMS networks when a goTenna comes within range or bounces that message to someone connected to a traditional network.
The company also released a software development kit today.
According to a company statement, “The goTenna SDK allows any developer to use goTenna hardware and protocols to transmit small bursts of secure data, at long ranges, completely off-grid.” It has already been in pilot tests with the U.S. Air Force and health tech companies.
A goTenna Mesh pair costs $129 if you pre-order via Kickstarter today, and will later retail for $179, no subscription required. The optional goTenna Plus premium subscription costs $9.99 a year for the first year, and $29.99 per year after that.
That’s a significantly lower price point than military- and enterprise-grade communications systems would cost, the kind that are used to keep people connected in off-grid situations, like after a natural disaster, or regions without much telecom infrastructure today.
Those typically cost thousands of dollars, Perdomo said.

According to the Brooklyn-based startup, point-to-point range for the goTenna Mesh is typically up to one mile in most congested areas and up to about three miles in a typical open terrain.
But the new devices allow users to privately relay a message through another goTenna user to the one they’re trying to reach if that intended recipient is out of range.
So, for example, if a group is on a camping trip off-grid, and one person is injured, the group’s members could spread out but still stay in touch as one person hikes furthest away, beyond 3 miles, to seek help.
The more users join a goTenna Mesh group, the more powerful it becomes, in essence.
GoTenna was co-founded by brother and sister duo Daniela and Jorge Perdomo after they experienced widespread communications systems failures following Hurricane Sandy in New York City.
GoTenna is backed by venture investors including Walden Venture Capital, MentorTech Ventures, BBG Ventures (a subsidiary of Verizon), and Bloomberg Beta.

547,Anna Escher,"Interface design collaboration tool Figma is launching its Multiplayer feature, which allows designers to collaborate in real time on the same projects.
The service, now available for everyone, is kind of like a Google Docs for interface design in that it wants to bring all of the pieces of the design process together so individual designers and teams can work in one integrated, browser-based system. Powered by the new Multiplayer functionality, the idea is to let designers and their teammates collaborate in real-time on professional design files.
For example, if two team members need to fix several parts of a design quickly before a deadline, they could both work on different sides of the image. Or if designers on opposite ends of the world need to compromise on a design, they can make their edits simultaneously while discussing them instead of clumsily passing static files back and forth.
The SF-based, 20-person startup was co-founded by CEO Dylan Field and CTO Evan Wallace in August 2012. It has since raised $18 million from Greylock Partners’ John Lilly, Index Ventures, OATV and ICONIQ, among individual investors LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, White House Chief Data Scientist DJ Patil, Wealthfront CEO Adam Nash, and former head of design at Dropbox, Soleio Cuervo. 
“Enterprise companies care so much more about design these days,” says Field. “The demand for design in tech has gone up so much. Despite that, we still work like we did 20-30 years ago with offline software applications.”

The company is trying to solve a problem for designers where collaboration is difficult across other teams of engineers and marketers. Importing and exporting dead PNGs for cross-team review is inefficient, and Figma wants to introduce a living, breathing system that makes sharing and building upon assets harmonious.
“Designers encounter a lot of different roadblocks working with engineers, product mangers and marketing people,” says Field. “Offline tools are totally divorced from the process. We’re trying to unite everything into one solution that’s seamless.”
The new Multiplayer feature enables this real time, collaborative editing, but the service also has a few other enticing features, like the ability to view designs and make real-time changes on mobile. Constraint systems let designs automatically adapt to devices of different sizes so you can preview complex designs cross platform. The company has been praised for its reimagined approach to the pen tool with Vector Networks.
Figma also touts its commenting feature, which allows for contextual direct feedback on designs. Say you want one of your designers to change a color on a file. You can make a comment to show this in real time. The system is integrated with Slack, too, so comments on files will mirror on Slack channels.
Recognizing that it’s the underdog in a market run by Adobe’s Creative Cloud suite, Figma says it won’t start charging for its services until January and wants to remain free for students forever. It’s important for them to let people develop an experience with the service and make a purchase decision when the time is right.",2016-09-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/twenty20_8f61b967-331e-4d13-8709-9a0446264055.jpg?w=738,figma,Figma now lets interface designers collaborate on projects
548,Anthony Ha,"Be honest: Have you ever spent an entire day working at a coffee shop, despite only buying a single cup of coffee?
I’ve definitely been guilty of this, and I’ve also been to coffee shops that try to fight back by removing outlets, turning off their Wi-Fi or outlawing laptops on certain tables. A startup called GoGoGuest is taking a different approach that could help coffee shops combat this kind of freeloading — and deliver a better experience for paying customers.
GoGoGuest installs printers in coffee shops, so that when you make a purchase, you get a receipt with a unique code. Depending on how the coffee shop has chosen to implement the technology, this code might be the only way you can get onto the shop’s Wi-Fi, or it might be your ticket to a special high-speed, “premium” network. Then, after an hour or two, the coffee shop can ask you to make another purchase if you want to stay online.
I’ve tried this out myself at GoGoGuest’s first location, the Chai Bar in San Francisco, where I ordered a cup of chai, got my code and was surfing high-speed internet a few seconds later. The company says it’s already seeing a 30 percent conversion rate from customers who are spending two to six hours online.
Co-founder Christopher O’Connor acknowledged that all of this is already possible with existing Wi-Fi technology — but it’s complicated enough to do that most coffee shops haven’t tried it. (Put another way: I’ve been to many shops where there’s a single password for the Wi-Fi, and only a handful where I got an individual code.) So GoGoGuest makes it easier by handling the installation, then gives store owners and managers a dashboard where they can manage the system.

GoGoGuest also offers an iPhone app for consumers, allowing them to browse a curated list of nearby coffee shops. As the system gets installed in more locations, you can imagine those stores being highlighted in the app, which could also be used to deliver targeted offers and promotions.
O’Connor said he sees GoGoGuest as a way for “mobile, social workers” to find places where they can work with the guarantee of a good internet connection, while his co-founder Jessica Valenzuela added that it’s a way for independent coffee shops to promote themselves and “be better positioned against the bigger coffee shops.”",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gogoguest.jpg?w=738,"wifi,coffee-shops,gogoguest","GoGoGuest helps coffee shops manage their Wi-Fi, customer-by-customer"
549,Jordan Crook,"Tinder is introducing a new premium feature called Tinder Boost. The feature will let users pay to have their profiles displayed first to other users on the app in the same locale for 30 minutes.
According to the announcement, it’s all about saving users’ time and making sure that the Tinder experience is maximized during the time that they’re actually using the app.
From the blog:
Tinder often tests new products in Australia first before going live globally, and Tinder Boost is no different. Australian Tinder users will have access to Tinder Boost soon, while other markets will have to wait until Tinder launches the finalized product.
Which brings me to pricing. Just as much as Tinder is using Australia to test the product itself, the company is likely also going to be testing pricing. That said, you can expect this particular feature to err on the pricier side, given that it’s only useful if it’s relatively scarce.
If everyone in a five-mile radius is able to purchase a quick Boost on a Friday night, showing up ‘first’ in someone’s Tinder feed starts to lose its effectiveness, and ultimately, its allure.

Tinder Plus users will get one free Boost per week, with the ability to purchase more. Users who don’t have Tinder Plus will also be able to purchase Boosts without joining the premium tier. To use the feature, you must be in Tinder swiping mode.
Taking cues from the Super Like, a premium feature that lets you send someone an extra-special like instead of a regular like, we can expect the Boosts to be sold both as singles and in packages.
That said, Tinder isn’t sharing exact numbers on the price just yet.
“With Tinder Boost, users can maximize their time and match potential by being one of the top profiles seen in their area with the tap of a button,” said Sean Rad in an emailed statement. “With 1.4 billion swipes a day on our platform, sometimes our users want to be sure that they are swiped to the front. We think our users in Australia will love this feature and hope to release it globally soon.”
Tinder isn’t the first to offer a product that puts you at the front of the dating line.
Match.com, a brand within Tinder’s parent company Match Group, also offers a paid Boost feature that puts a user’s profile in the Popular Singles tab and at the top of search results. Bumble, an app like Tinder but where women are in the driver’s seat, also launched a time-saving feature as part of its premium tier, letting you see at the top of your feed people who have already liked you.
However, like Match’s Boost, Tinder stands to generate even more revenue off the Boost feature as it’s sold on top of Tinder Plus (save for the free weekly Boost) and it isn’t available for free to unpaid users.

550,Josh Constine,"LendUp was supposed to be different than the payday loan sharks that rip off the poor when they need emergency cash. But in its early days, LendUp charged customers illegal fees, miscalculated interest rates, falsely advertised loans nationwide that weren’t available there and misled people that borrowing from LendUp would boost their credit score.
Now LendUp will have to pay $6.3 million for the violations in a combination of refunds, fines, and settlements. That includes a $1.8 million fine by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for failing to keep its promises, and a $100,000 fine from the California Department of Business Oversight for the fees and interest rates.
LendUp CEO Sasha Orloff spoke to TechCrunch, admitting his company didn’t have a big enough compliance and legal team to review all of its promotions and features. To remedy the situation, LendUp proactively refunded any wrongly charged customers and ceased all problematic practices as soon as the investigation began. Now, Orloff says his 190-employee company has a 15-person-plus legal and compliance division — more people than the entire LendUp team at the time of the infractions.
You can read the full announcement from the CDBO here:
In a statement to the press, Orloff tried to pass off the problems as growing pains of a young startup, which he told me was cash constrained, and had to make tough decisions about who to hire and what to build. He wrote, “These regulatory actions address legacy issues that mostly date back to our early days as a company, when we were a seed-stage startup with limited resources and as few as five employees. In those days we didn’t have a fully built out compliance department. We should have.”
The penalties might merely be a speed bump for LendUp, though. It raised a $47.5 million Series B round last month to bring itself to $111.5 million in equity funding, giving it plenty of cash to pay the fine and keep operating.
Founded in 2011, the startup sells its LendUp Ladder payday loan, which comes with a flat fee and lets you borrow more if you pay back promptly. More recently, it launched the LendUp credit card, which is free if you pay back on time and lets you pause charges and watch your credit from an accompanying smartphone app. The company claims to have saved Californians over $18 million during 2016, and an estimated $40 million for customers nationwide.
LendUp positioned itself as a compassionate alternative to high-interest credit cards and scammy debt trap payday loans that can charge up to 500 percent to 700 percent in interest. That might ring hollow if customers dig out LendUp’s skeletons.
Now LendUp claims it’s locked those skeletons in the closet long ago. Orloff writes, “We are a different company today, with a compliance team of ten and a separate in-house legal team of six, including our Head Regulatory Counsel and seasoned General Counsel. Importantly, those teams are brought in at the beginning of the development lifecycle for every new product and feature.”
Additionally, Orloff tells me LendUp hired former regulators to come in and build out its compliance program. A study shows it now makes good on its claim about boosting financial health, as a third-party review by TransUnion found LendUp customers are more likely to raise their credit score than non-borrowers or those borrowing from another lender.
To customers, Orloff writes, “We take our commitment to operating in a transparent, compliant and socially responsible way very seriously.” He says the company’s morale remains strong because employees believe it’s evolved significantly from when it was one-twentieth its size and made these errors.
The startup wasn’t allowed to discuss the ongoing investigations until they were recently completed. But now Orloff is sad about what regulators defined as a fee. He and General Counsel Angela Jeffers explained that LendUp offered a 30 cents per day discount if borrowers pledged to pay back early. But if customers missed the self-imposed discount deadline, their discounts would be removed day-by-day, which regulators considered a fee.
You can read LendUp’s full statement here:
LendUp didn’t have to legally admit wrongdoing… but it clearly did things wrong. Not as wrong as Zenefits, which had to fire it CEO, blow up its whole brand and start from scratch rebuilding trust with insurance clients. But LendUp has given old-school banks and competitors in the increasingly crowded fintech space the ammunition they need to cast doubt on the startup’s claims of trying to help the poor.
That jeopardizes LendUp’s dream of building a compassionate modern banking brand, which attracted investment from top VCs like Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, GV (Google Ventures), AFSquare, Data Collective, Kapor Capital and SV Angel. Alternatively, the fines could be seen as growing pains that signal LendUp was trying to rush to market and stake a claim, which some investors endorse. Uber’s cavalier attitude toward regulation has shown the potential of the “move fast and break things” mantra popularized by Facebook.
But Uber typically hurt taxi drivers by sidestepping the rules while providing convenience to its users.

551,Ludovic Ulrich,"

The startup world moves at breakneck speed — what’s hot one minute is old news the next, and it can feel like the rules of the game change every day.
For successful startups, rapid growth often attracts the attention of incubators and accelerators, and popular programs such as Y Combinator and Techstars have been instrumental in launching some startups to great success.
However, there are other options. Namely, partnering with tech “titans” — bigger technology companies that used to be startups themselves and understand the journey. These titans can offer access to resources, R&D, capital and customers, and many are now seeking to attract startups to their own ecosystems.
Business visionary Steve Case argues we are now entering the Third Wave of the internet — an era in which entrepreneurs have the ability to change the way we live by driving transformation through technology. Part of this new era requires rethinking relationships, specifically those with large organizations that have the capability to support startups’ missions to invent new business models and scale.
Founders may be wary of partnering with a large company because they don’t want to get locked into a particular platform, or, even worse, look uncool to fellow startups! But partnering with a tech titan to advance goals is actually a very smart move. Of course, careful calculation is required. How do you choose the right titan? Here are some things to look for.
Choosing a tech titan with which to partner requires an honest assessment of the company’s credibility in the market. Beyond ensuring their values are a match, it’s important to assess whether the titan’s reputation and brand cachet has the power to attract and provide you with top-tier guidance, technology and go-to-market capabilities. Another indicator to consider is the titan’s track record of dealing with startups positively and supportively.
Once startups build their products and obtain seed funding, they often struggle to scale and gain traction with their market. In fact, 75 percent of startups fail, according to The Global Startup Ecosystem Ranking 2015. This is due to lack of customers, not necessarily funding — although many founders spend a huge amount of time chasing their next rounds.

To succeed, early-stage startups not only need to build the right product, but also need to gain traction with the right customer base. Titans may introduce you to their established customers, in addition to potentially investing directly. In fact, corporate venture capital is picking up speed, as many large companies that prioritize innovation are setting aside funds for external investment in companies and startups. According to the Venture Pulse Q2 2016 report published jointly by KPMG and CB Insights, VC-backed companies raised $27.4 billion across 1,886 deals in Q2 2016.
The reality facing founders today is that there is no shortage of potential partners in the market willing to hedge their bets on a group of promising startups. For that reason, selecting a titan that truly understands the market you are targeting is paramount. Key to establishing and defining this shared commitment is holding open and honest conversations during the discovery period of your relationship, setting joint milestones and remaining true to your vision but open to suggestions. This will help you determine if a titan is willing to invest some skin in the game and be a true partner when you need it.
The best companies understand that innovation doesn’t happen in a vacuum, and that relationships are the key to success. While tech titans might not be the most obvious place to start when thinking about partnerships, ignore them at your peril! All startups don’t want to be startups forever. Titans can share key insights for navigating your growth journey. And many are generous when it comes to sharing resources, customers, experience, funding and more.",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/app-store-graveyard1.jpg?w=738,"partnerships,mentors",Avoid the startup graveyard
552,Matthew Lynley,"Othman Laraki and Elad Gil were sitting on Twitter’s roof deck after their previous company Mixer Labs had been acquired. Gil had brought a small hard drive with him — which happened to contain data on his genome being sequenced — and Laraki wanted to take a look at the data.
That led to the original hypothesis of Color Genomics: what if you could apply the same principles of data science and deep learning to analyzing the human genome, bringing the cost of scouring our information for signs of cancer and other potential problems and making it more widely available?
Fast forward a few years later and the pair, along with co-founders Taylor Sittler and Nish Bhat have started and are running a genomic testing company, Color Genomics. The company today said it has raised an additional $45 million in capital in a round led by General Catalyst Partners, with new board members Hemant Taneja (of GC) and Susan Wagner (co-founder of Blackrock and also on the board of Apple).
“We’re living through that transition into really starting to use this massive amount of data in the actual delivery of care process,” co-founder Laraki said. “It’s kind of funny when we take our cars to get an oil change they probably pick up more info from the car’s computer than our bodies when we go see the doctor. That transition I think is one of the big things that’s happening, what I think is really exciting about this timeline, we are living through that massive addition of data into how we think about care and prevention and such.”

Right now, Color Genomics is focusing on testing for mutations that can lead to a higher risk for cancers, like ovarian, breast, prostate and colon cancer. If the patients know that they are higher-risk, they can practice the best-known methods to help prevent those cancers from getting worse, such as getting regularly tested — in the case of colon cancer, regularly getting colonoscopies.
Color Genomics patients provide the company a saliva sample, which is tested with a combination of in-house scientists and software engineers that dig through the data available from those tests in order to find mutations that can lead to a higher risk of cancer. The data collected is shipped off to cloud servers to crunch through it.
There’s an incentive for companies and other payers to get these kinds of tests. While the current test costs $249, if a payer ends up covering part or most of the cost, in the long run detecting risk for cancer and intervening can lead to an incredible cost savings for payers. If you’re a company covering medical insurance, it makes perfect fiscal sense to offer — and encourage — employees to regularly get these kinds of tests done.
“For companies in many ways, they wear multiple hats,” Laraki said. “They’re payers, they’re covering the cost of cancer treatments which is very expensive. Preventing late-stage cancer once pays for an entire program. In addition they’re obviously very deeply aligned with the well-being and the actual outcomes for their population. For them it ends up being this double-value where it has a very direct ROI but in addition the employees and families are very grateful and happy to have access to something like this.”

“I don’t think you can subsidize your way to something that’s accessible to a full population,” Laraki said. “Having something that’s truly worthwhile from a payer standpoint, government or company, that if you invest X and get more than X back out — turning that and demonstrating it’s ROI positive, that’s a big piece there.”
As part of extending the test’s reach into additional markets — and people — Color Genomics is launching a program that offers family members of people who have paid for tests an option to also get tested for $50. If someone ends up being a carrier of a mutation that can lead to a higher risk of cancer, that mutation came from somewhere in the family tree, and identifying who else possesses it can also help them potentially intervene before things get worse.
Of course, relative to any kind of genetic testing — or any medical-related testing — is the overcast of the fallout from the Theranos scandal. What Laraki says is that the company applies many widely used standards and robotics, in addition to being highly transparent and publishing its validation data and working with well-known scientists.
There are, of course, potential competitors that could arise. Genetic testing startups like 23andMe and Ancestry.com, which Laraki says focus more on “recreational” understanding of the human genome and a person’s background, could decide to branch into an area like this. Laraki says the company’s deep focus initially on detecting risks for cancer and application of data science is what will eventually lead Color Genomics to being a full-fledged company. And if they’re successful, they can potentially grow into other kinds of operations.
“Part of the conversation was, what happens when you assemble truly world class software engineering team to work on this information, what can we do for people,” Laraki said. “If we can drop the cost of these tests by an order of magnitude, do we fundamentally change the math around clinical genetics. Not the recreational genetics, but clinical stuff. We’re really focused on building the infrastructure to make that possible, proving to ourselves that was something that would work.”
Color Genomics launched its first product about a year ago, and has in total raised $60 million.",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/color-lab-2.jpg?w=738,"ancestry-com,color-genomics,23andme,theranos",Color Genomics raises $45 million to provide cheaper genetic tests that detect cancer risk
553,Sarah Perez,"Tinder today is launching a new application for social polling. The company announced the debut of “Tinder Stacks,” an app for iMessage users that will let you use the “swipe to like” gesture the dating app popularized for anything you want – whether that’s polling your friends which photo should be your new profile picture, what outfit you should wear tonight, or anything else.
While Tinder Stacks is discoverable though Apple’s iMessage App Store, it’s not technically a standalone application. Instead, the new app is included with the flagship Tinder application. That means if you already have Tinder installed, the new Tinder Stacks app will automatically become available in iMessage – if you haven’t turned the “Automatically Add Apps” switch off from the “Manage” tab of the iMessage App Store.

The idea behind the app is fairly straightforward.
You simply select a group of photos you want feedback on by selecting them in the app’s interface. This creates a card stack, similar to what you would find in Tinder. You can then send out the card stack to your friends, and they’ll be presented with a familiar Tinder-like interface where they can swipe right or left to indicate they like or don’t like the item in question, respectively.
While just a fun little app, Tinder Stacks could allow the dating service to reach a younger demographic. Many pre-teens, teens and young adults favor social polling applications, as peer feedback and social acceptance is an important part of their lives at their age. The App Store today is filled with dozens of social polling apps, but many have focused on sharing out polls via social media sites, like Twitter and Facebook.
Tinder Stacks’ launch follows a slew of product updates for Tinder in recent days. The company also this week announced Spotify integration with user profiles, following its rival Bumble. It has also added other social features like the ability to recommend Tinder profiles to friends, and the expansion to include new friend-finding through the launch of Tinder Social.",2016-09-21,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/tinderfeature.jpg?w=738,"mobile,apps,imessage-apps","Tinder’s newest app, Tinder Stacks, lets you swipe on anything"
554,Haje Jan Kamps,"As any eBay, Etsy or Shopify seller will tell you, if you’re selling stuff online, photography is up there with the top most important parts of your sales listing. And yet, there’s a load of sellers who are great at making doo-dahs, gizmos and wotsits but who post photos that are, frankly, embarrassing. Orangemonkie fixes that with smart and easy-to-use lightboxes and turntables, making photography fool-proof for online sellers.
How important is it? Very. In fact, Shopify itself is including Orangemonkie’s Foldio in its Stockroom — the company’s collection of products “to help you start your business.”
Orangemonkie’s Foldio360 is a Bluetooth-driven turntable controlled via a smartphone app. You can either use the smartphone itself to take the photos, or a supported SLR camera. Given how good smartphones are these days and how tremendously easy to use Orangemonkie’s app is, it hardly seems worth it to bother with the fancier cameras.
The one exception I can think of is if you prefer to use studio flashes or a strobist-style photography setup. If you do have a hankering for a bit of SLR action, you’ve got to admire the company’s solution. Triggering the camera is done via the IR receiver used for the remote control on most cameras. The turntable itself has an IR transmitter and the app tells the turntable which signals to send. Ingenious, because it means the company can add additional camera compatibility with a software update.
Foldio360 is available for pre-order now on its own for $119, or for $194 including the additional softbox/lighting kit. It was originally a half-million-dollar Kickstarter campaign, and Daniel Kim, the company’s marketing manager, assures me that the Kickstarter backers are receiving their turntables in the post as we speak. For orders placed now, the company expects to ship later this month.
Foldio2, Orangemonkie’s softbox, is available to order now for $75.

555,Lora Kolodny,"Gametime has raised $20 million in venture funding for an app that allows people to find and buy tickets to a nearby concert or sporting event at the last minute, and even up to a half-hour after a game begins.
Evolution Media Partners led Gametime’s Series B round, joined by GV, Stanford’s StartX Fund, Accel Partners, Casey Wasserman and Jeff Mallett.
The funding brings Gametime’s total capital raised to $33 million to-date.
Founded by Brad Griffith in 2013, Gametime has steadily added tickets from more professional sports teams and to a wider variety of events over the years. It sells tickets from both primary sources and resellers.
The startup has also rolled out features and video advertising to attract millennial sports and music fans.
For example, Gametime’s Snap and Sell feature lets users take a photo of a paper-based ticket to list it on their marketplace, and price it automatically.
And Gametime Connect allows app users to find and follow friends, see the events for which they’re purchased tickets, or have tickets to sell, then buy one to go along.
To promote its Connect feature, Gametime created a video spot that quickly racked up over 4 million views on Facebook, driving thousands of transactions for the company.
The campaign helped Gametime stand out in a market rife with competition.
Gametime is up against longstanding marketplaces like Ticketmaster and Ticketweb (both owned by Live Nation), Stubhub and its parent company Ebay, Pandora-owned Ticketfly, and private equity and venture backed players like Vivid Seats, SeatGeek and Applauze.
The startup, which now employs about 65 full-time in San Francisco, estimates that the “last-minute” segment already represented some $7.5 billion in North American ticket sales last year.
Colin Evans, Gametime’s Chief Revenue Officer and a founding employee of Stubhub, said he predicts this segment will grow, thanks to the fact that consumers, especially 18-34 year olds, are increasingly purchasing via smartphones and on-the-go.
Griffith added that stadiums’ adoption of mobile instead of paper tickets has also helped drive the trend, and Gametime’s growth.
Virtually all stadiums and professional sports teams now accept mobile tickets, he said, and many smaller music venues that you would not expect to be technologically advanced do as well.
According to PriceWaterhouse Coopers, the North American market for sports tickets sold from primary sources is projected to grow to $20.1 billion by 2019. And according to Pollstar, the North American concert business saw sales hit $3.12 billion just across the top 100 tours in 2015.
Early Gametime investor Jeff Mallett, a part-owner of the San Francisco Giants and former Yahoo executive, said he expects the startup to use its new funding for hiring, and to build new event discovery features for ticket buyers, and tools for ticket suppliers.
Mallett said, “We are a clean sheet company with no legacy behind us. We want to be the best option, on the supply side, for teams sending us inventory.”

556,Frederic Lardinois,"Google first announced Allo and Duo, its new messaging and video chat apps, at its I/O developer conference earlier this year. Duo launched about a month ago and today it’s Allo’s turn.
With Allo, Google is combining everything it has learned from its previous messaging products with the company’s machine learning smarts. Indeed, Allo marks the first time you’ll be able to use the Google Assistant, the company’s more conversational version of Google Now that will also soon find its way into products like Google Home, Android Wear and others.

Given that Google already owns Hangouts, a messaging service that also includes video chat, the obvious question here is why the company would launch another one. As Google’s VP of communications products Nick Fox told me, the reason for this is that the company wants to position Hangouts as its productivity and enterprise service, while Allo and Duo are its consumer products.
“When we think about the enterprise case, it’s actually different from the user case,” he said. “We made a choice to have a different case for enterprise and one for consumers.” The team basically decided that in order to build the product it wanted, it had to make a set of core decisions (which included splitting video and text chat into two different apps) and start from scratch. One area in which you can see this new approach is that Duo and Allo are based around your friends’ phone numbers — not Google accounts.
As far as the core messaging experience in Allo goes, everything is pretty straightforward. The Allo feature that got the biggest applause at its unveiling was the ability to make text appear bigger or smaller (to shout or whisper) when you press and hold the send button and then drag up or down. I don’t think that’s Allo’s most exciting feature, but it does allow you to add a bit more personality to your chats.

Talking about personality: Where Apple went with lots of corporate partnerships with the likes of Disney and Nintendo, Google opted for working with independent artists for its stickers in Allo. There are currently just under 30 sticker packs in Allo. Themes range from a pack that features an alcoholic and moody sloth to ones that feature partying marshmallows, Otto the Octopus and Stella the Starfish and a very sad puppy. The style here is more often reminiscent of some of the edgier animated shows on Comedy Central. All of the packs are available for free.
You can, of course, also send images (and draw on them), share your location and dictate text.
All of that is table stakes, though — and Fox pretty much agrees with that, too. “Because messaging is already used by billions of people, people think messaging is a solved problem,” he told me. “But we don’t see it that way. We actually think we are on the cusp of a new generation of messaging apps. We think of it as smart messaging.”
What makes Allo different then is its integration with Google’s machine learning smarts and the Google Assistant.
I mostly think of Google Assistant as the conversational version of Google Now. While you could already have some basic back and forth with Google Now ever since it started understanding pronouns, the Google Assistant takes this to a new level.
There are two ways to work with the Google Assistant (which is officially still in preview) in Allo. You can simply chat with it directly, just like you would do with a friend. Or you can bring it into a conversation by typing @google and asking it a question.
When you first start chatting with the Google Assistant directly, it’ll politely introduce itself, ask if it can use your device’s location and then give you a few examples of what you can do. Like Google Now, it can tell you the weather, and it lets you set timers, alarms and reminders and ask general questions. You can also use it to see the latest news or specific news about a person or event (and subscribe to daily updates about them) or ask about nearby restaurants, flight delays and other standard queries you are likely familiar with from Google Now. You can also play a trivia game and, if you feel like you are in a confessional mode, you can tell the Assistant things about yourself, too.
Ideally, this results in a conversation with the Assistant, though you do hit upon its current limits pretty quickly. Too often, you ask it a question about a topic it doesn’t know about and all the Assistant returns is a link to a web site. At that point, the conversation simply ends.
The ideal conversation is basically: “Show me some nearby sushi restaurants.” “Here are the listings for sushi restaurants within 4 mi.” “Which ones are open now?” “Here are listings for Shogun Sushi within 10 mi.” “Give me directions to there.” And then you get directions. At every step, Allo presents you with a few tappable options, too.
For the most part then, chatting directly with the Assistant doesn’t always live up to its potential yet, though it’s easy to see how this will become more useful as it gets smarter over time.
Where the Assistant does come in handy, though, is in chats with other people. You can easily pull in a Google search for a restaurant when you are looking to go out as a group, for example, or want to give directions to somebody.
While support for the Google Assistant is probably the marquee feature of Allo, its use of smart replies — that is, the canned, pre-written responses you may already be familiar with from Google Inbox — is also very interesting. For the most part, these work really well. When you are chatting with the Assistant, this feature will often pull up useful follow-up questions, but even as you are just chatting with a friend, it’ll regularly pull up just the right response. In the worst-case scenario, that means you may end up having a conversation with a friend that’s really just two bots talking to each other, but ideally, the response you would’ve typed is there already and you can save yourself a few taps (which is especially useful when you are on the go).
Smart Replies even works for photos, so when your friends send you pictures of babies, you can save yourself from typing the obligatory “oh, he’s so cute!”

By default, all of the chats in Allo are encrypted using standard protocols. Allo does have an Incognito mode, too, though. Once you turn that on, chats are end-to-end encrypted and you also get the advantage of features like discreet notifications, which doesn’t show the message content in the standard mobile notifications, and message expiration, so your message auto-deletes after a set time that you can set from 5 seconds to a week.
The obvious question here is why Google didn’t turn these features on by default. Fox tells me that when the chat is end-to-end encrypted, features like smart replies and the Google Assistant simply can’t work because Google’s algorithms can’t see the content of the chats, either. For some people, that may just be what they want. “We think it’s important that users have the choice,” Fox told me.
And given that users do have a choice, chances are most of your friends won’t be on Allo just yet. For them, the app allows you to kick the message over to your SMS client to chat with them, but for Android users, Google is also introducing a new feature called “app preview messages.” With these, your friend still gets a notification and the ability to write an in-line response, just like you would do with a chat app you have installed on Android. The message will also include a link to download Allo, of course.
Google’s strategy around messaging has been rather confusing in the past. Hopefully, the focus on specialized apps will put an end to this for the time being, especially if Hangouts does indeed become its enterprise/productivity app. I understand Google’s reasoning for launching yet another set of apps, but, personally, I would have rather seen the company build these features like Google Assistant into the Hangouts app (and I assume it will actually do that in the future).
To be fair, the Assistant is still in preview; I’d like to see it get a bit smarter still, though. When it gets everything right, it’s a great user experience — but step outside of its comfort zone and you’re better off just doing a regular search in your browser. As Fox rightly noted, though, there is a reason it’s in preview right now. He also noted that part of that reason is that it’s meant to work together with Google Home and other Google apps that are either not on the market yet or don’t feature Assistant support yet. For now, Allo is the only app that features the Assistant, so some of the cross-service functionality remains limited.
Still, Allo is a competent messaging app that gets all its core features right. I can see myself switching to it from Hangouts for chatting with friends and family (though I do miss the fact that there’s no built-in voice-calling feature yet).",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/allo-head.png?w=738,"google-hangouts,google-duo,google-allo",Allo brings Google’s smarts to messaging
557,Matthew Lynley,"A big annoyance of city living is checking a site like Nextbus for your bus or rail’s arrival time, and then getting there only to find that you’ve missed it by a split second or the doors close as soon as you get there. Now, there’s actually an app that will yell at you to walk faster if you’re about to miss that bus.
With a big update today, Transit — an app that cleanly shows all the upcoming arrival times of public transportation in your area — is hoping to keep your daily commute on track with a new tool called Go. The app is getting a redesigned look in order to keep up with the ever-changing aesthetic desires of picky smartphone owners.
The app monitors your walking speed, telling you whether you’re going to get to your stop in time. It then will change your connections around if there are detours or delays in order to get to your destination on time. It’ll even wake you up before you get to your final stop, if you’re on a long commute and decide to use the train ride to catch a quick nap before work.
“When we first launched our app there wasn’t even a journey planner, this was back in 2012, because for us it was nailing that [commuter] experience,” Transit COO Jake Sion said. “I’m standing in a bus stop, leaning into traffic to see when my ride is coming, the only info I care about is when the bus arrives. With transit, there is so much info you provide the user and our goal is to make sure we don’t forget what it is most people want.”
The company said it has raised $2.4 million from Accel Partners, Accomplice, Real Ventures and BDC. Before raising this financing, Transit had only raised a small amount of seed funding for its operations based in Montreal. The app is available in around 125 cities in more than 9 countries.
The argument against using Google Maps, Sion says, is that you’re required to put in information for your entire route before you even have access to the next arrival times for buses. Google Maps is an experience largely centered around getting from point A to point B, while Transit is designed to be a quick lightweight commuter experience — you glance at your phone to see where it is, and then you move on.
For the more curious Bay Area transit nuts, some of Transit’s data is actually pulled from Nextbus — the typical go-to tool for figuring out when your next bus is arriving. Sion says that, in addition to Nextbus, Transit works to collect information from a number of municipal sources into getting the most accurate arrival time. Earlier this month, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority chose to endorse Transit as effectively the official app for keeping track of transportation in the Boston area.
But, in short, the data simply isn’t that reliable sometimes. And it can prove to be one of the most costly experiences of taking public transportation, such as being in a rush and being forced to call an Uber or Lyft to get to your destination on time. If Transit can help mitigate that risk, not only would it make for a generally better user experience, it could help make the municipal transit systems in cities overall more efficient and attractive to riders. And that means it could get additional revenue coming in and more opportunity to continue improving.
Going forward, there are a couple of things that Transit would like to do — number one, making sure it’s more accurate. If you’re in San Francisco you’ve probably experienced the frustration of arriving at a Muni stop only to find an asterisk next to an arrival time, basically telling you to stay put and, hey, maybe sometime in the near future it’ll get there (or call an Uber). Transit wants to do a better job of keeping track of user interactions in the app in order to more accurately predict bus and rail arrival times.
The problem already requires a lot of technical expertise, as the data coming in from all these different transit authorities is coming in through different channels and in different forms. That makes it a huge unstructured data problem, and cleaning all that up and compressing it is probably Transit’s first big challenge. A large part of the financing the company is raising is to ensure that it can continue to be the fastest and most accurate way to get that information by hiring additional engineers.
“It’s about bringing that entire urban transportation experience into one place,” Sion said. “What we realized is at the core of how people travel through cities it’s still public transit, it’s about how we improve that experience the most.”",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/export_screenv2.png?w=738,"transit-app,transit",Transit’s public transportation tracking app gets a big overhaul and $2.4M in funding
558,Matthew Lynley,"While there’s plenty of talent in the San Francisco Bay Area — where Pinterest’s main office is over at 5th and Brannan in San Francisco — it can be very costly to find and recruit that talent. And there’s a lot outside of San Francisco as well.
One city, in particular, that Pinterest has turned its eyes to is Seattle. Last month, it opened an engineering office in the city, and today it said it has hired its first head of engineering, Ruben Ortega, who was most recently the CTO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and an engineering executive at Nordstrom and Google prior to that.

Like looking for talent in cities like New York and other places, building and staffing up these offices serves two purposes: it helps keep talent that don’t necessarily want to move to the Bay Area to be in the mothership, and it also opens an opportunity to poach talent from other companies in an area.
In this case, Microsoft and Amazon can basically serve as an engineering graduate school for many potential candidates for companies based a few states south. Right now, it looks like that’s where things are headed for the office for the time being, with it largely being centered around engineering. But as the company continues to grow and more resources are poured into hiring, looking beyond the Bay Area is one of the first big steps it has to do in order to remain competitive.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-20-at-8-04-13-am.png?w=738,pinterest,Pinterest hires a head of engineering for its new Seattle office
559,Kjartan Slette,"

When Apple launched its iBeacon protocol at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2013 it laid the foundation for an entire new industry — the proximity industry.
Three years later, close to 500 proximity companies operate globally, and between 6 and 7 million beacons are deployed in commercial settings with the latest forecasts pointing to a total of 500 million beacons by the end of 2020. Not bad for something that was really only launched as a side note amongst several other new technologies at the Apple conference.
Beacons are cheap, easy to use and can run on batteries. They quickly became the de facto technology to connect the physical world with the digital due to beacons being able to inform a phone of their precise physical location and context.
This is something marketers globally have dubbed “the holy grail of marketing,” and no wonder – as the physical world and how we use it has been largely unchartered territory. To not only finally discover that world, but to also connect it to our digital footprint has immense value both product wise and economically.
Apple knew this, and so did Google. Google’s competing beacon standard, Eddystone, which is interoperable with iBeacon, could do something that Apple couldn’t or wouldn’t — open URLs directly from the beacon interaction.
This, coupled with the fact that Apple favors closed environments, propelled Google’s Eddystone — with its openness to the developer community — onto the proximity scene. Eddystone was launched mid-2015 and has seen immense growth since then. As seen in the recent Q2 Proxbook Report, the industry support for Eddystone from proximity companies has grown from nothing to 50 percent in just one year, while Apple is losing ground.
Apple being largely quiet since its 2013 iBeacon release has led to widespread speculation around the launch of “iBeacon 2.0” — an improved protocol that mirrors Eddystone’s web capabilities while pushing the boundaries for how to integrate the physical world more deeply into the OS itself. Apple is in a prime position to do precisely that, and yesterday we might just have seen the first signal of what is to come.
Beacons require Bluetooth to function, and while the percentage of “Bluetooth on” is between 40 percent and 50 percent in the U.S., there is still a way to go to reach a market adoption that makes sense for most large global advertisers. And guess what is one of the main drivers for Bluetooth adoption? Yes, Bluetooth headsets. And what did Apple just kill? Headphones that are not Bluetooth-enabled.
Interestingly enough Bluetooth headphones now account for 54 percent of U.S. dollar sales in the category according to NPD, and the timing for Apple to accelerate that growth is perfect.
So, is this a sign of Apple being determined to fix the Bluetooth adoption issue before they release iBeacon 2.0 and push back toward Google? Or, more radically, a sign of Apple backing a wireless technology standard that is superior to the Bluetooth we know, spearheaded by its new wireless AirPods and W1 chip?
Both are interesting thoughts, and while nobody really knows but Apple, two things are crystal clear: Bluetooth adoption is going to increase, and the war of ownership over the physical world has just begun.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/beacon.jpg?w=738,,The evolving road of beacon tech
560,Frederic Lardinois,"One of Google Photos‘ standout features has long been its ability to automatically create short movies whenever it recognizes you went on a trip. Until now, though, the system that built those movies mostly used time and location (as well as some image recognition tools) as markers for which photos to include. Starting today, Google is going beyond simply making these vacation-/trip-related movies and is launching its first theme-based movies for Google Photos, too.
The first movie the company is rolling out centers around children. This is meant “to help people who have tons of photos and videos of their child or another kid in their life and little time to organize them,” a Google spokesperson told me.
Ten years ago, the photos you took of your children probably ended up in an album (or a shoe box, depending on how organized you are). These days, parents take hundreds of pictures of their children, upload them to a service like Google Photos and then maybe share one or two more widely. With this new type of movie, Google Photos will look at the photos and videos you’ve taken of a kid — even if they are spread over multiple years — and Google’s algorithm will then pick the best ones and create a movie out of them.
“People have told us ‘it would be wonderful if Google Photos could make a movie showing my child growing up over the course of years,'” Google Photos product manager Tim Novikoff told me. “So we’re doing that, with one movie concept — users with years of photos of a child will get one of these.”
Novikoff says this is only a first attempt at bringing themed movies to Google Photos, though. “But we’re also making movies that span months and days. An example spanning months is a concept which puts together your smiles from this past summer to commemorate the good times. An example spanning a much shorter time range is a concept for formal events like weddings,” he said.

Also new in Google Photos today is an easier way of sharing photos and videos. It’s now easier to share them with other Google Photos users, for example. Google Photos already offered the concept of shared albums that multiple people could contribute to. If you simply wanted to share a photo with somebody, though, you had to email it to them or send it through some other Google or third-party app. Now, if you are sharing with another Google Photos user, the experience will be significantly smoother.
If you are sharing a photo with somebody who isn’t on Google Photos, you still use the same sharing dialog and contact picker and simply enter their email address or phone number. Google then handles the rest for you by either sending and email, text message or in-app notifications.
Also new: When somebody opens a photo you shared, you’ll now get a notification.
“This update is all about making it simpler to get photos, videos, and albums to the right people,” Kedar Kanitkar, the tech lead for the Google Photos Sharing project, told me. “Sharing photos with friends and family isn’t super easy — everyone uses different apps, and it’s hard to keep track of who is using what. For example, one of my friends is a die-hard Google Photos user, another I usually contact by email, and a third has changed his email address so many times that a text message is the only way I know I’ll reach him. ”",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/google_photos_select.png?w=738,"digital-media,business,world-wide-web",Google Photos ups its movie and sharing game
561,Darrell Etherington,"GoPro is revealing many new goodies today, including a few new accessories with run the risk of getting the lost in the noise. They’re actually pretty interesting, though – there’s the Quik Key, a micro-USB card reader that lets you grab pics and video from your GoPro and pop them right onto your phone for sharing and editing; and the REMO, a voice-powered remote control that adds extra range to the built-in voice command features of the new HERO5 camera line, as well as a manual one-button interface.
The Quik Key works with the Quik mobile app, which automatically edits your clips and adds transitions and music, matching the pacing of cuts to the beat of the background tunes. With the Key, you can grab your content easily from the camera’s memory card, and then quickly insert it into your phone to get the clips into the app, where they’re automatically integrated into your video edits. It’s also on a keychain so you don’t lose it, which is good because it’s tiny.
GoPro’s REMO builds on the idea that what you really want to do with your action camera is yell at it, which makes a certain amount of sense because you’re likely going to have your hands full if you’re extreme sportsing (me and Nick Woodman decided this is a real term. Not really but I feel like he’d back it).

562,Sarah Perez,"Google today is launching a new mobile application, aimed at helping you better plan your vacations and other travels. Called Google Trips, the iOS and Android app pulls in a combination of data from Google Maps and crowdsourced contributions from other travelers, in order to offer a personalized travel guide that helps you keep track of your day trips, reservations, points of interest, tourist attractions, restaurants and more.
We already knew Google was working on a travel application, thanks to a leak earlier this year when the app was being tested within Google’s Local Guides community. Local Guides help to improve Google Maps and business data by writing reviews, correcting listings, and taking photos. In return, they gain exclusive access to try out new Google products and features, such as Google Trips.
The app looks today much like it did then.
The home screen includes a search box with a prompt “where do you want to go?” for planning new trips, and other cards let you keep track of your current and upcoming vacations and plans.

What’s helpful is that each city you plan to visit during one of your trips can each have its own tab within the larger “Trip” section, and with a simple toggle switch, you can download all the information about that destination for offline access.
Meanwhile, on each city’s screen, a variety of colorful cards help you jump into various sections like “Saved places,” “Day Plans,” “Food & Drink,” “Getting around,” “Things to do,” “Reservations,” and more.
But the app isn’t just for collecting information – it can also make suggestions. Google says Trips can show you the most popular day plans and itineraries for the top 200 cities worldwide. This information is actually based on historic visit data from other travelers, which Google has then assembled into lists that include the most popular sights and attractions.

Also interesting is how this crowdsourced data is combined with other information pulled from Google Maps to help you find things to do near one of your planned sightseeing destinations.
You can add a spot you want to visit to your plans, and you even can tell the app if you have only the morning or afternoon available for this outing. The app can then show you other attractions near that original spot, so you can take in other sights worth seeing within having to commute too far.
This can definitely help with time-constrained trip planning, as it allows you to cram in more activities within a certain vicinity.

Plus, there’s some automation involved here, too – you can tap and pin a spot you have to visit to your itinerary, and Google Trips will automatically fill in the rest of the day for you. Meanwhile, you can also tap a “magic wand” button for more options of nearby sights, then pin those you like to further customize your itinerary.
In addition to sightseeing, the app can also track flight, hotel, car and restaurant reservations, which makes the app something of a competitor to Concur’s TripIt, and, to some extent, the new territory Airbnb is carving out with its own forthcoming Airbnb Trips app, which will focus on travel services.

However, what makes Google Trips compelling is that it leverages Google’s ability to tap into the data you have stored in your Gmail, as it automatically gathers your reservations from your email and organizes them into trips on your behalf.
While the new app will be useful for travelers, it will also serve as another means of data collection for Google itself, which will be able to better augment its business listings data in Google Maps with the information collected by the app and its users.
Google Trips is live now on Android and iOS.
In addition to Trips, Google has also now launched its Destinations search feature on the desktop worldwide, following its mobile debut this March.

563,Diomedes Kastanis,"

Throughout history, new technologies have constantly changed the way we’ve worked. They’ve been responsible for full-scale revolutions. And continued investments have come as corporate demand for worker productivity drives tech spending.
We should expect augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) to eventually attract increased spending in the enterprise as they combine with new mobile network advancements to make an emerging trend called “productive mobility” a reality.
Productive mobility is about being as productive out of the office as inside, and as productive in a virtual instance as a physical one.
Consider Boeing’s use of augmented reality glasses to streamline plane assembly workflows, decreasing assembly time and reducing errors by 25 percent. This is amazing. It’s also just the beginning of this reality-transforming workplace future.
That’s where critical mobile network developments come in. Many of the most exciting AR applications require instant environmental interpretation, and rapid delivery of contextually relevant information and functionality. VR, in particular 360 stereoscopic video, greatly raises the payload overhead of rich media.
Fixed and mobile broadband network advancements like fiber and 5G, along with service provider-centric content delivery topologies, deliver higher throughput with lower latencies. New convolutional network designs find patterns among previously insurmountable massive data sets, enabling rapid, intelligent predictions about the network, the things connected to it and the users engaging with it.
This is opening new doors to productivity and information sharing in the enterprise.
Today, typical network management sees supervisors tracking field technicians using a wall of screens. Those in the field can share what they see via streaming phone video, but that leaves their most precious resource — their hands — unusable.
A VR interface replaces a wall of screens with a massively expanded desk space, giving supervisors front-seat insight into what their techs experience. Remote feeds are shared by techs via their AR-enabled headsets, and access to tutorials, checklists, voice guidance and visual cues from supervisors collectively shortens repair times. For common issues, this information is automatically displayed as the tech works through repairs.
Experts and highly skilled contributors need no longer be physically present to solve remote issues — their precious knowledge now a scalable resource thanks to the application of AR and VR.
It’s hard to think outside the box when your work ends at a screen’s edge. Network managers must monitor large sets of data to assure performance, services and more. Current work spaces are cramped with 2D screens and computers. Keyboard and mouse-based input limit speed and interactivity. Locating and sharing the right views while collaborating with others can be cumbersome, particularly during time-sensitive crises.
VR changes this dynamic. It provides a virtually scaled collaborative canvas that lets teams work from shared data sets, spread out and arranged in a manner not possible with physical screens. Virtual hands can manipulate data, such as rotating a globe to identify the geographical source of an issue. Voice commands further streamline work flows, allowing collaborators to ask common questions, access different network views or perform complex tasks while simultaneously drilling down into other resources.
Along with hand gestures and voice commands, VR creates a team fluidity that is lacking in today’s work environments. Different team members can have different default views based on their roles, with global communication taking place in the same virtual environment.

The use cases and applications discussed here aren’t just cool ideas. Some were on display this year at IBC in Amsterdam, showcasing transformative approaches to common enterprise needs to operators, content owners and broadcasters.
Productive mobility isn’t a theory, it’s a practice, advanced by network innovations and interface achievements. An exciting new future of enhanced enterprise productivity is within reach — even if a VR headset is required to touch it.",2016-09-18,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/workoutside.jpg?w=738,"virtual-reality,augmented-reality",Productive mobility is poised to give business a virtual boost
564,Brian Heater,"This isn’t so much an acquisition as a welcoming back into the fold. Urban Engines was formed in 2014 by a bunch of former Google employees, with backing from Google Ventures and Eric Schmidt. The startup was formed to help deal with urban congestion and improve user commutes.
Last February, the company launched a self-titled app that brings some key features to mobile mapping – among them speedy computation, an augmented reality mapping mode and the ability to utilize maps offline line in the key North American launch cities, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Portland, San Francisco, Seattle, Toronto, Vancouver and Washington, D.C.
Urban Engines uses the buzz phrase the “internet of moving things” to describe its big picture idea, utilizing analytics gathered by urban commuters to help control the flow of cities. And now the company is taking its data collection and platform back to the Mountain View mothership.
Hidden way down in a blog post outlining the company’s history, Urban Engines announced that it’s being rolled into the Google Maps team, “we’re excited to combine forces to help organizations better understand how the world moves.”

565,Brian Heater,"While the rest of the iPhone obsessed world was getting ready to stand in line or just impatiently waiting for their pre-order to arrive, the teams at iFixit and Chipworks were sharpening their tools like underfed lumberjacks sitting down to a steak dinner.
Both sites offered liveblogs of their iPhone 7 (and 7 Plus) teardowns and spotted some interesting tidbits in the process, discovering a handset that looks a lot more different on the inside than out. But first they had to dig through a whole lot of glue – a membrane of sorts that seems to play a key role in the phone’s newfound water resistance rating, along with the haptic home button, which also serves to eliminate a long time pain point of broken buttons.
Among other issues, using glue as part of the waterproofing process may mean that you lose some of that feature when the phone is repaired.
On the chip front, the A10 is front and center. And there’s a whole lot of it on the surface, with a 125 sq. mm footprint. The chip, which also bears the far less memorable name APL1W24, looks to be manufactured by TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), tapped in part due to its InFO technology, which keeps the chip extremely thin.
On the unit torn apart by Chipworks (A1778), an Intel mobile cellular platform is present, including two RF transceivers, power management and modem. There may well be Qualcomm manufactured chips on the CDMA A1660 version, due to some CMDA licensing issues for Intel. Info on that is still to come.
Both Hynix and Toshiba have been employed to provide storage for the new phone. As for memory, there’s 2GB on the 7 and 3GB on the 7 Plus, according to the reports.
iFixit’s report gives the handset a bit of a mixed bag on the repairability front. In addition to the aforementioned glue, Apple has added yet another screw type, bringing the required screwdriver count up to four.

566,Anthony Ha,"Optimizely has helped to popularize A/B testing — the idea of trying out different versions of a website or mobile app to see which one performs better.
However, co-founder and CEO Dan Siroker said the practice has largely been limited to marketers testing relatively superficial changes, such as the text or the layout of a page. So today, at its Opticon user conference, the company announced a new version of its platform, now dubbed Optimizely X, which Siroker said will allow for “experimentation in code.”
“We made experimentation accessible to the mere marketing mortal — we made this good idea something that anyone could do,” Siroker said. “That same thing will happen for developers.”
For example, Optimizely says customers will be able to experiment with search results, product recommendations, pricing and various product features. While I suggested that experimenting with the core functionality of your website or app might seem a bit riskier than fiddling text, Siroker replied, “Most of our customers love the idea of experimenting as a way to mitigate risk. The worst outcome is to go live too soon to 100 percent of [their] customers.”

Optimizely X includes support for experiments in Python, Java, Ruby and Node. Siroker noted that the platform will allow testing across different types of devices, including connected TV apps built for tvOS and Android TV.

568,Devin Coldewey,"The flaming train wreck that is the Galaxy Note 7 recall finally has its official stamp of approval from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and there’s now a hard date for when you can swap your phone for a new one: September 21.
The CPSC previously issued a brief statement saying it was working on an official recall — but that the delay shouldn’t stop users from powering down the affected phones immediately. CPSC chairman Elliot Kaye announced more details today, and said at a press conference that he is “urging all consumers to take advantage of this recall right away.”
The language of the recall notice is similarly forceful. “Consumers should immediately stop using and power down the recalled Galaxy Note7 devices,” it reads. Do not pass go, do not check Instagram. Ninety-two phones have already overheated, resulting in 26 burns and 55 reports of property damage — don’t increment those numbers by failing to heed this advice.
It’s been a protracted process, this recall: Samsung took action directly when reports of combusting phones began to bubble up, first in Korea and then elsewhere; it vacillated on the severity of the problem and eventually announced a full recall of the 2.5 million Note 7s already in the wild (about 1 million are in the U.S.).

It could be that Samsung was working out whether they could get away with simply replacing the batteries in the phones, or whether recalling the entire device was necessary. That would, after all, be much cheaper, and users could keep the phones they’d bought.
The full recall ended up being necessary, of course, and now owners of the devices at least have a date when they can get a new one, if they decide to give the phone — which, other than its habit of burning up now and then, is really quite nice — another shot.
Put your phone’s IMEI or serial number into the box at the official Samsung recall page to make sure you’re affected — ironically, after telling users to power down the phone immediately, the instructions suggest “going to “Apps > Settings > About Phone or General Management > Status > IMEI information or Serial number.” We’d recommend just checking the back of the phone.",2016-09-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/smartphones3.jpg?w=738,"consumer-product-safety-commission,galaxy-note-7,recall",Official CPSC recall goes out for Galaxy Note 7 — replacements will be available September 21
569,Haje Jan Kamps,"As any eBay, Etsy or Shopify seller will tell you, if you’re selling stuff online, photography is up there with the top most important parts of your sales listing. And yet, there’s a load of sellers who are great at making doo-dahs, gizmos and wotsits but who post photos that are, frankly, embarrassing. Orangemonkie fixes that with smart and easy-to-use lightboxes and turntables, making photography fool-proof for online sellers.
How important is it? Very. In fact, Shopify itself is including Orangemonkie’s Foldio in its Stockroom — the company’s collection of products “to help you start your business.”
Orangemonkie’s Foldio360 is a Bluetooth-driven turntable controlled via a smartphone app. You can either use the smartphone itself to take the photos, or a supported SLR camera. Given how good smartphones are these days and how tremendously easy to use Orangemonkie’s app is, it hardly seems worth it to bother with the fancier cameras.
The one exception I can think of is if you prefer to use studio flashes or a strobist-style photography setup. If you do have a hankering for a bit of SLR action, you’ve got to admire the company’s solution. Triggering the camera is done via the IR receiver used for the remote control on most cameras. The turntable itself has an IR transmitter and the app tells the turntable which signals to send. Ingenious, because it means the company can add additional camera compatibility with a software update.
Foldio360 is available for pre-order now on its own for $119, or for $194 including the additional softbox/lighting kit. It was originally a half-million-dollar Kickstarter campaign, and Daniel Kim, the company’s marketing manager, assures me that the Kickstarter backers are receiving their turntables in the post as we speak. For orders placed now, the company expects to ship later this month.
Foldio2, Orangemonkie’s softbox, is available to order now for $75.

570,John Biggs,"The EpiPen, a spring-loaded device full epinephrine, of has entered the pantheon of modern pharmaceutical chicanery of late after its maker raised its price to $600 a unit. Now, however, you can make your own EpiPencil for about $30.
The EpiPencil is a project by the Four Thieves Vinegar Collective, a group of pharma hackers who are trying to loosen medicine from its arguably necessary commercial restraints. One of the project’s leaders, Dr. Michael Laufer, created a how-to video describing how to make and load the pencil with epinephrine.
You can find a complete list of parts here.
The concept isn’t without its detractors. Jennifer Miller, a professor of medical ethics at NYU, told Spectrum that “releasing a schematic of a medical device that hasn’t been validated by a regulatory agency is irresponsible” and that a DIY pharmaceutical system without regulation is dangerous.
“If your child is having a life-threatening allergic reaction, you want to make sure they get the right medicine, at the right time, at the right dose,” she said. “An EpiPen will give you what you need, she says, “but you can’t guarantee that with this other device.”
Hacking pharmaceuticals is a very dangerous game. But if we run major electrical and transportation systems on “home-grown” Linux why can’t we experiment with simple tools like the Epipen? Given that it’s basically an injection system that can be easily re-engineered in multiple ways there must be a way to re-engineer it to make it cheaper and easier to acquire. Pharmaceutical companies obviously have dueling missions, first the Hippocratic injunction to do no harm and second the impetus to raise money to further research. While many see Big Pharma as rapacious a greater number have been saved by its products. On the other hand we have philosophy of free knowledge and this is one of the most dramatic examples of that principle. While not many folks will follow Laufer’s instructions to hack the system, it’s nice to know the plans are available and out there and someone is thinking about alternatives.",2016-09-21,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-11-30-06-am.png?w=738,medicine,"Pharma hackers create a DIY EpiPen, the EpiPencil"

More precisely, Apple is talking with McLaren Technology Group, the parent company of all things McLaren, including McLaren Automotive.
While McLaren is a famous name in the world of supercars and Formula One, it isn’t a gigantic car manufacturing company. The company reported $617 million in revenue (£475 million) for the entire year of 2015, representing $27 million in net profit (£20.8 million).
The FT thinks this acquisition could cost between $1.3 billion and $2 billion (between £1 billion and £1.5 billion). While this seems like a significant acquisition for Apple, the company has made a bigger acquisition in the past with Beats.
In particular, when it comes to automotive, rumor has it that Apple has been working on a secret car project for years.
Bob Mansfield recently took over the car division at Apple. The company also recently made a $1 billion investment into Didi Chuxing.
While Apple engineers are hard at work on self-driving technology, manufacturing a car is still uncharted territory for the tech company. Acquiring McLaren could be a way to hire many engineers who know how to make cars, engines, chassis and more.
This is still an early report and the acquisition talks could still fall through. Either way, it’s interesting to see that Apple wants to be a serious player in the car space.
Update: McLaren told the BBC that the company isn’t having any investment discussion with Apple right now.
Independently, the NYT confirmed that Apple and McLaren have been talking about a potential investment. McLaren’s statement could mean that it’s an acquisition (not an investment), it has closed (not in discussion) or the discussion has ended.",2016-09-21,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/7896672886_f3980efa58_o.jpg?w=738,mclaren,"Apple is in talks with McLaren for a potential acquisition, report says"
572,Haje Jan Kamps,"Freshly launched at Photokina, Z Cam just launched its S1 camera. Aimed at the VR crowd, the camera captures four perfectly synchronized 4K streams for high-end 360 video recording. With the new camera, the company is gunning for GoPro’s $15k Odyssey rig. Z Cam’s team claims that its sleek four-eyed beast can match Odyssey’s video quality at a tenth of the price, with far shorter post-processing times and the option for real-time stitching.
“The S1 has a lot of advantages over other camera systems,” the company’s CEO Kinson Loo explains. “We use four Sony sensors, but only a single PCB. As a result, we can get perfect synchronization between the cameras, which is virtually impossible when you connect a number of GoPro cameras together.”
The camera is capable of outputting 4K at 60 frames per second or — more relevant to filmmakers — 6K at 30 frames per second.
“It’s no really about resolution, however,” says Loo. “Image quality is far more important than the number of pixels a camera delivers. That is where our camera really shines. We talked to VR studios and content creators and all of them are looking for a better VR camera. So we decided to create one for them.”
“Smaller is better,” Loo explained when I asked him what the biggest challenge in creating the camera was. “but we had to find a balance between heat dissipation and size. The camera’s body is an aluminum alloy which helps keep the electronics cool. We have been very successful: The camera can run for hours at the time without overheating.”
The company’s CEO quips that this might have been the reason the newest generation GoPro cameras are water-proof: dunking them in ice water is the only way to keep them from over-heating, he says.
Not-so-gentle ribbing of the competition aside, the Z Cam S1 is a serious piece of kit, with a serious price tag to match. At $2,000, it’s a high-end product aimed at VR professionals.
Each of the four lenses on the camera has 190 degrees of coverage. The four streams can be saved to four SD cards inserted into the camera, or streamed straight out from the four dedicated HDMI ports. There is also a Gigabit Ethernet port that enables high-speed image transfer and live preview of what the camera is filming.
Even sensors from the same batch have slightly different characteristics, but Z Cam claims it has found a way to overcome this, with special algorithms to coordinate exposure, white balance and the aforementioned synchronization to make the post-processing as painless as possible.

In addition to the camera, Z Cam is marketing a video stitching suite for real-time stitching. If you don’t require streaming video, the company claims you can use any video stitching software to combine the four streams into a fully immersive 360 video package.
The product launched on Indiegogo earlier this week, with a $2,000 price tag.
Z Cam supplied a sample video shot with the camera; it’s is embedded below.

573,Devin Coldewey,"Asteroid mining is coming soon to a planet near you: this planet, and in 2021, to be specific. But NASA’s Asteroid Redirect Mission has lots of work to do before that point. Today the space-faring organization issued an official “request for proposal” from four partners on how they would go about creating the robotic spacecraft that would perform the actual asteroid redirection in question.
This mission is a bit different from OSIRIS-REx, which recently got underway. The idea there is to go to an asteroid, grab a piece and return it to Earth — difficult enough, but it wouldn’t be the first collection of “live” asteroid matter — that was already achieved by the Japanese probe Hayabusa a few years ago (an astonishing achievement, by the way).

Boeing, Orbital ATK, Lockheed Martin and Space Systems all participated in a “conceptual design phase” in which the basics of the spacecraft were established, but this is the opportunity for each to differentiate itself from the others. The configuration of, say, the sensors with which the ARM craft will scan the surface, or the mechanism of its lander, are still up in the air.
Those four will have about a month to get their proposal together: October 24 is the due date, and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory will make its decision some time next year.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/arm_nasa_asteroid_mission.jpg?w=738,"asteroids,jpl,space,nasa",NASA’s asteroid-harvesting mission solicits proposals for its robotic spacecraft
574,Jon Russell,"Last week we wrote about Timeular, a nifty little box that makes the dreaded chore of tracking your time at work easy, and now it is available on Kickstarter.
Essentially it is an eight-sided device that is Bluetooth-enabled and acts as a timer. You simply program each side to a different task and tip it when you’re working on a particular task or change to another.
The polyhedron is called the Zei and costs €69 (just under $79) for the first 1,000 early birds, and then €79 ($89) thereafter. There’s a cheaper option for a DIY model (€39) and, at the higher end, a series of packages that look targeted at larger companies with many employees that fill out timesheets for their work. That could be a legal practice, marketing agency or any business that works with clients and/or bills based on time.
Timeular was developed over a paid beta testing period that filled up quickly when announced earlier this year. Aside from the hardware, it includes compatible apps for tracking time spent on work and assigning tasks to the box. There’s also a pro version of the software with features designed to boost productivity. Timeular CEO Manuel Bruschi told us last week that the team is working to develop a productivity recommendation system, too.

575,John Biggs,"The promise of premium home 3D printing hasn’t panned out. Hobbyist printers are common and cheap these days – there are plenty of models at around $500, the price of a really good laser printer – but the original vision of a 3D printer on every desk didn’t quite pan out. And Makerbot learned that piece of news the hard way.
When the company started it was the brand to beat. Makerbots were well-made, nicely designed, and reliable. They were proudly made in Brooklyn in a way that electronics hadn’t been manufactured in that borough for a century. in fact, in July 2015 the company opened a new factory in the heart of hipster country.
“The launch of factory here today is just evidence to the fact that we expect and are committed to remaining here,” said Makerbot CEO Jaglom that July at the factory’s opening. A year later that factory closed. Growth fell. The Makerbot name became, in a way, toxic.

A poor cultural fit as well as a class action lawsuit related to the company’s seemingly faulty Smart Extruder brought the high-flying company crashing down. Now it’s bringing things back home.
Fast forward to today. As Brian Heater wrote, Makerbot has launched two new printers, a “Professional” model and an educational one. Rather than offer a few simple sizes – a tiny one, the Replicator Mini, for fun, a bigger one called the Replicator, and the biggest one, the Z18 – they’ve focused on two markets, education and pros. Even their website, once a whirlwind of consumer facing fun, is now focused primarily on those two segments.

It’s a strange thing to watch. Makerbot was supposed to commercialize the 3D printer, to give us all a reason to churn out plastic gewgaws with our super-cool 3D printer. Instead it brought about countless competitors who all raced to the bottom and, after rushing to market, a faulty product that ruined its reputation.
Makers aren’t going away. There is still plenty of call for a home 3D printer. Now that they are inexpensive, efficient, and easy-to-use there is little reason to pay a premium for a premium product when you can pick something up at half the price.
I’ve had Makerbots since they launched and I haven’t had trouble. But I know plenty of owners that did. Now that the company has gone from general-purpose fun machine to a professional and serious 3D printer company, I suspect many of those frustrated owners will abandon the brand for something cheaper. While Makerbot still has the best software and the new models have some truly interesting improvements (including a unique flexible bed that makes it easier to remove prints) I think the true test will be who wins the hearts and minds of average person looking for a 3D printer in the next few years. Given that no one has truly cornered the market I suspect they will do a quick Google search and find Makerbot complaints, lawsuits, and product announcements… and will head somewhere else.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/makerbot-2015-featured-image.jpg?w=738,"makerbot,printing,printer,3d-printers","Makerbot doubles-down on its sure bets, professionals and teachers"
576,Devin Coldewey,"When someone has lost a hand, particularly the dominant one, it can be a real challenge to do the simple clicks and drags that all of us take for granted on our desktops and laptops. A German design team has created a device to remedy this, detecting signals from the user’s remaining muscles and translating them into common digital gestures.
Even the best prosthetics lack the fine motor control that allows for efficient operation of mice made for smaller, more pliable digits. And forget about holding a mouse steady between thumb and finger while using a third to scroll.
This isn’t just an annoyance; with computer use critical to practically every job now, having a prosthesis entails a great deal of retraining or workplace accommodation, neither of which many employers are likely to relish (equal opportunity hiring notwithstanding).

Shortcut — you’ll forgive these Germans their dark sense of humor — removes the necessity of physically performing those tiny movements. Instead, the user equips the inside wrist of their prosthesis with a watch-like wristband. This has an optical sensor in it, and acts like a wireless mouse when the user moves their prosthetic around.

The Shortcut team instead maps these movements to mouse gestures while the accessory is active. Imagine making a quick pinching motion, and the muscles in your arm will twitch in predictable fashion, which the software sends on to the computer as a click. Pinch with your second finger and it’s a right click. Scroll up and down by bending your wrist.
These motions are familiar; at the tips of our fingers, so to speak. They simply have no fingers to act on. So repurposing them in this way is both ingenious and practical.
The team prototyped the device with a 3D printed case and wired Arduino, but the final product will be wireless — who wants to plug in their arm while they work?
“Right now it is just a proof of concept,” wrote Maximilian Mahal, one of Shortcut’s creators. “It works, though. But not very stable. We are using a Myo bracelet for the current prototype, however we plan to use more sophisticated myoelectric sensors somewhere in the near future. We want to develop a more reliably working prototype for intensive user testing with amputees, in order to refine the concept and design.”
The designers, David Kaltenbach, Lucas Rex and Maximilian Mahal, are design grad students at Weißensee Academy of Art Berlin. Shortcut won them the STARTS prize, awarded by Ars Electronica.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/shortcut-prosthesis-1.jpg?w=738,"design,robotics,prosthetics",Accessory for prosthetic limbs lets users interact directly with digital media
577,Romain Dillet,"After a summer of beta versions, Apple has just released the final version of macOS Sierra. macOS Sierra is the major update of OS X El Capitan — yes, OS X is dead, long live macOS. Other than the name change, this year’s update brings many neat improvements over El Capitan, making it a polished update from day one.
It’s available in the Mac App Store as a free download. If you don’t see the update right away, don’t panic as it could take a few minutes due to App Store propagation.
But first, backup your Mac. Make sure your Time Machine is up to date, clone your hard drive to an external hard drive, save your data to your favorite online file storage service. Try to have at least two different backups — you don’t want to lose your data.
After downloading Sierra from the App Store, the installer should open automatically. If it doesn’t open automatically, go to the Applications folder in the Finder and open the “Install macOS Sierra” app.
One of the most promising changes is that Siri is coming to the Mac for the first time. The assistant can replace many of Spotlight’s features – like helping you find a file, perhaps, or search through photos. It can also help you interact with your Mac, like turning on or off your Wi-Fi, start FaceTime calls, set reminders, or adjust your volume.
Like on iOS 10, the Photos app has also been overhauled with new features that take advantage of computer vision to recognize the people, places and things in an album, then organize them into intelligent collections. It also curates your past photos into collections via a new tab called “Memories.”
Messages on macOS Sierra is getting tweaked as well, with rich previews for web content as on iOS. You also get the ability to watch video clips in the app, and other features like iOS 10’s bigger emoji, ‘tapback’ options that let you respond to messages with emojis (e.g. Heart, Thumbs Up, Ha ha, and more). Unfortunately, you won’t be able to access the iOS 10 Messages app. But you’ll be able to view stickers.
Safari’s big improvement in macOS Sierra is picture-in-picture for watching videos – something that’s already available on select iPads. Meanwhile, other applications like TextEdit, Pages, Mail, and Maps are getting Safari-like Tabs.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/macos-sierra.jpg?w=738,"macos-sierra,macos",macOS Sierra is now available to download
578,Haje Jan Kamps,"You don’t have to spend a long time in tech journalism before you get pitched a whole stack of companies that make you scratch your head and ask yourself “why?”
LuDela is but one example. The company makes a smartphone-controllable candle featuring real, actual fire. Why? There are plenty of real problems to solve; creating fire at the touch of an app isn’t among them.

A small part of me loves these pitches. The creativity is incredible. The chutzpah is admirable. The amount of time and money invested in their pet projects is balls-to-the-wall hard-core. A much bigger part of me doesn’t love these pitches.
What worries me is that none of these projects are without challenges, and the fact that people have invested weeks, months, years of their lives into making these products a reality is a bona-fide tragedy. These are people with real skills and entrepreneurial spirit, investing a renewable resource (money) and a non-renewable one (time) into products that really aren’t going to move the needle.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m as bored as the next man of startups that are going to change the world, but at least they have one thing clear in their minds: They think that what they are doing is worth doing.
Before you start your next venture, consider the opportunity cost of starting that venture. A startup will take years of hard work, inhuman amounts of dedication and will come with a very real personal cost. Startups are stressful, bad for your physical and mental health and often bad for your existing and new interpersonal relationships. The question becomes simple: Will the world be better off if you invest your time in this venture, or if you invested your skills, experience and — most importantly — time into another project?
“We’re the creators of the world’s first and only real-flame candle you can light and extinguish from your smartphone,” writes the company’s co-founder and CEO. “LuDela candles meld the beauty of traditional candles with 21st century technology to maximize safety and convenience.”
While it’s probably neat to be able to light a candle from your phone, it’s a fantastic example of something the world could do perfectly well without.
The company is launching its crowdfunding campaign on its own website today. It will probably be mind-bendingly over-subscribed. And for every dollar it raises, I will lose another fragment of my already fraying faith in humanity.

579,Darrell Etherington,"Surprising no one, The Pokémon Company’s CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara told the WSJ in an interview that Pokémon games will appear on Pokémon’s upcoming console, which is codenamed the “NX” and which Nintendo says is launching around March 2017. It’s not clear whether Pokémon games will be available for NX in time with launch, but assurance that the maker of the beloved series (the  second highest selling in history, in fact) is on board might help sell consoles regardless.
Ishihara also told the WSJ that he’s interested in the approach Nintendo is taking with its upcoming NX hardware, which sources suggest is a hybrid device that can operate as both a home console, and as a completely independent mobile gaming platform.
“The NX is trying to change the concept of what it means to be a home console device or a hand-held device,” Mr. Ishihara told the newspaper. While it isn’t definite confirmation of the rumors, it does suggest that reports of a hybrid hand-held approach are on the right track.
Pokémon was already among the most popular video games in the world prior to the launch of Pokémon Go on iOS and Android earlier this year, but the runaway success of that game, developed by Google spin-out Niantic, has helped raise Pokémon’s profile to a new category of players, and has helped inject new life into the sales of existing Pokémon games and Nintendo hardware.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/gettyimages-546827218.jpg?w=738,"the-pokemon-company,pok%c3%a9mon-go",Pokémon will come to Nintendo’s category-busting NX console
580,Darrell Etherington,"Higher resolution is making for larger video and images, but luckily, flash memory capacity seems to be keeping pace. A new SDXC card from SanDisk unveiled today has 1TB of space available, which basically means you can put it in a camera and essentially forget it even has a storage cap at all.
The new 1TB capacity is just a prototype for now, meaning there’s not pricing or availability date yet, but the company has launched a 512GB version for $800, so it’s likely to be expensive whenever it does land. But you also get more storage space than typically ships with the base configuration of most home computers, so premium pricing is to be expected.

581,Brian Heater,"I’m a bit surprised Canary didn’t just go ahead and make the Flex its flagship. For starters, the camera is just a heck of a lot nicer looking than its predecessor, a white (or black) pill-shaped product with a glossy black frot and a glowing power ring on the bottom that brings nothing more to mind than HAL-9000, that ultimate bastion of home security.
It there’s a complaint to be had about the Flex’s industrial design, it’s the fact that the security camera might be too nice looking to stick outside your house, since doing so may be akin to saying, “hey, free security camera.”

For the time being, however, the New York hardware startup is keeping its original model around. And, indeed, that first generation does offer some features not available on the new line, including temperature and air quality monitoring, maintaining that device’s position as sort of a central home hub – though, to be honest, those extras always felt more like the company’s attempt to distinguish itself from the competition, rather than necessary additions.
At $200, the Flex is currently priced the same as the OG Canary, though as the name implies, it offers a certain level of additional freedom. That comes thanks to a combination of added portability and the ability to operate on battery power, meaning it’s not tethered to an outlet all the time – definitely a plus for those looking to push their operations between a single, central room.

That titular flexibility is brought to the device courtesy of a beefy battery rated at “months” of life, in Canary’s estimation. And when time comes to charge it up, it does so via a magnetic charging port, which helps with another key element of the new camera: weatherproofing. That means that the Flex can also be set up outdoors, transmitting what it captures up to the company’s cloud storage service via WiFi.
There’s also a magnet on the bottom of the camera, which snaps into a base, making it possible to manually swivel the camera 360-degrees, so it can be pointed in any direction. Beyond just the one in the box, the company got pretty creative with the different bases here, no doubt enjoy the newfound freedom of an untethered product.

There’s a secure mount that screws into the side of a wall, keeping the Flex anchored and, hopefully, out of the reach of grabby masked bandits. A stake mount makes it possible to nail the camera into the ground, for patrolling backyards. The twist mount is the most fun/interesting of the bunch, a flexible, rubberized skin that can be wrapped around objects like pipes or tree branches or anything long and skinny, really.
The company has also partnered with Verizon on a beefy LTE mount that brings added cellular service to the portable security camera, so it can be moved well beyond the walls of the house. Pricing on that accessory has yet to be announced. As for Canary’s new Membership security software package, that will run $10 a month for one device and $14 for two to three cameras. The service features 30 days of recordings, unlimited storage and downloads, along with a $1,000 deductible.

The Flex is up now for pre-order. It’s set to ship before the holiday.

582,Devin Coldewey,"When you see or hear something happen, you can instantly describe it: “a girl in a blue shirt caught a ball thrown by a baseball player,” or “a dog runs along the beach.” It’s a simple task for us, but an immensely hard one for computers — fortunately, IBM and MIT are partnering up to see what they can do about making it a little easier.
The new IBM-MIT Laboratory for Brain-inspired Multimedia Machine Comprehension — we’ll just call it BM3C — is a multi-year collaboration between the two organizations that will be looking specifically at the problem of computer vision and audition.

Note: This article previously stated that “no money is changing hands,” but this is not quite the case. While IBM declined to provide specific financial details, these academic partnerships do involve varying amounts of funding and sharing access to resources and personnel on both sides.
The problem of computer vision spans multiple disciplines, so it has to be attacked from multiple directions. Say your camera is good enough to track objects minutely — what good is it if you don’t know how to separate objects from their background? Say you can do that — what good is it if you can’t identify the objects? Then you need to establish relationships between them, intuit physical rules… all stuff our brains are especially good at.
Handy, that last part, and also the reason why “brain-inspired” is in the name of the lab. Using virtual neural networks modeled on how our own real-life neural networks operate, researchers have produced all kinds of interesting advances in how computers interpret the world around them.
The MIT partnership is one of several IBM has established lately; the company’s VP of Cognitive Computing, Guru Banavar, details the rest in a blog post. Other collaborations are pursuing AI in decision making, cybersecurity, deep learning for language, and so on. IBM is definitely making a huge investment in foundational AI work and it makes sense to cover their bases. All together the group of partnerships comprises what’s called the Cognitive Horizons Network.
And yes, they’re working to make sure the machines don’t come for us all later:
“We are in the process of building a system of best practices that can help guide the safe and ethical management of AI systems,”wrote Banavar, “including alignment with social norms and values.”
Whatever those might be. At the rate social norms and values are changing, it’s as difficult a bet to figure what they’ll be in 10 years as it is to guess what AIs will be getting up to.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/shutterstock_228897490.png?w=738,"ibm,artificial-intelligence,computer-vision,robotics",IBM and MIT partner up to create AI that understands sight and sound the way we do
583,Stefan Etienne,"It was announced on the second day of the month, and, well, here it is: The wireless version of Bower & Wilkins’ P7 headphones.
Well, how are they? As great as I’d hoped, but there are some changes that were made that seem out of place. But rest assured: Despite being tailored to the mid and high frequencies, they still have those warm, roomy lows for bass.
Price as reviewed: $399 at B&W
Taking them right out of the box, you’ll understand what you paid for. Leather, metal and plush memory foam ear cups are the basis for the wireless P7’s aesthetic. Like, look at those hinges!
Being worn for extended periods of time, I find that they’re comfortable.
You might think this is a very subjective opinion, but over-ear headphone comfort can be boiled down to three points: not causing an immense amount of pressure on the temples; encapsulating the ear (and not resting on it); not leaving a massive imprint (again, pressure) on the top of your head.
A delicate balance between these three characteristics usually means that the headphones can balance themselves on your head, rather than being worn like some sort of audio helmet.
Now, with comfort out of the way, let’s talk about audio quality: It’s what $400 in audio hardware should usually provide. Punchy bass, clarity and a feeling of isolation that is not to be confused with noise-cancelling headphones — after all, these aren’t — but more akin to being in a very quiet room that’s always filled with music. No matter the genre of music, it sounds like it’s been enriched while not losing any of the inherent qualities of the music.
And all of these observations are made using the Bluetooth mode, which is important if you’ve purchased an iPhone 7 recently. Speaking of which: battery life. B&W says the P7 wireless lasts 17 hours, and it turns out they’re not entirely wrong: Depending on whether or not I make calls using the (very solid) built-in microphone, I find myself squeezing out 15 hours of collective — not continuous — usage.
Now that I’ve praised the auditory experience of Bower & Wilkins’ P7 wireless headphones, it’s time to take it down a notch and come to terms with its shortcomings. There aren’t too many, but they are there.
While not an immense setback, the lack of touch-based controls can be considered bland, considering the variety of “clever” solutions that rival companies like Bang & Olufsen and Harman Kardon employ in their higher-end headphones. Here, B&W gives you three rather indistinct buttons: volume up/down and play/pause.
The sliding power button also doubles as the pairing button if you hold it down for three seconds. None of these approaches are inherently wrong or non-functional, but they’re not novel, and not what I expect from a company like Bower & Wilkins.
While some might argue that touch-based controls are hit-and-miss, they’ve become accurate nowadays, even with the threat of wireless interference from the Bluetooth headphones they are mounted on.
Now it’s time for honesty: Not everyone is in the market for a $400 pair of headphones. But, if you happen to be, love the color black (which you should) and are conscious about Bluetooth’s inevitable rise (hopefully), then they’re worth a look. Or, perhaps you haven’t a choice, because you bought an iPhone 7; woe is you.
Regardless of what your reasons are for buying into Bluetooth headphones, B&W has a winning product with the P7 wireless. I’ll be glad to keep using them until I find something better.
Or maybe, something with touch controls.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dsc_2557.jpg?w=738,"wireless-headphones,bowers-and-wilkins",Bower & Wilkins’ P7 wireless headphones are all luxe and great performance
584,John Biggs,"Of all the products I’ve seen this year, none are more worthy of our time and attention than the Ripple Rug. Created by Fred and Natasha Ruckel, the Ripple Rug is a rug with holes and lumps in it. Your cat can climb inside, stick its paws out, and generally get all up inside that business. It’s 35 inches on each side and made of recycled plastic bottles.
Why is the Ripple Rug so interesting? Because after creating the product the Ruckels began dealing with drop shippers, eBay buyers who sold the product for a massive profit while saddling the creators with dissatisfied customers and returns. Day after day they had to send cease and desist letters to a legion of resellers who weren’t doing their customers any favors by charging $20 over their retail price and simply shipping the product through Amazon.
The effort was taking its toll on the couple and they were losing money. Their only recourse? To pull their product from Amazon and sell it themselves at a loss of almost $40,000 a month.
You can hear about their troubles on Planet Money and read this article about the couple by Jason Feifer. It’s a fascinating look at the other side of building a product.
In fact the Ripple Rug is a perfect example of where we’re headed on the Internet. Manufacturers like Apple control their pricing through extremely careful policing and big legal teams while small makers like the Ruckels face drop shippers by the eBay-load. If the customers looking for Ripple Rugs had only gone to the official Amazon store – a matter of running a quick search – they wouldn’t have cost the Ruckels all of that revenue and paid far less for the same product. But because we the consumers are lazy we will click to buy anywhere on the web and then whine when we spot things cheaper.
Further, it shows us why some industries – car dealerships, watch manufacturers, and luxury good makers – work so hard to control their markets. It makes no sense on the surface but it becomes increasingly clearer once you realize the ramifications of drop shipping.

585,John Mannes,"We’ve all had crappy customer service calls. Primed by staticky elevator music and the ever-mysterious agitating echo, most of us come into calls with strained patience. On the line, customer service and sales agents are paid to build relationships, but after a long day of working with callers (who typically only call if they’re having a problem), even the bubbliest of people can start to fade.
MIT Media Lab spinout Cogito is crunching the numbers to give workers real-time feedback on call performance to gently nudge better conversation habits. Cogito tracks dialog speed, pauses, interruptions, volume changes and tone, among other metrics, to provide real-time recommendations.
Cogito has effectively modeled typical conversations in various contexts and industries. The rapport of an outbound sales call will be much different than an inbound call from a frustrated customer. Data collected is compared to norms in specific call types and tangible conversational recommendations are fed back.

The technology is squarely focused on communication by phone, but real-time conversation analysis is primed for growth. In addition to serving call centers, the DARPA-backed startup has dedicated resources to solving a number of non-commercial problems. The U.S. Military Academy at West Point is working with Cogito to provide to cadets real-time feedback on negotiation skills.
Many of the greatest applications of speech analysis will come at the nexus of qualitative behavioral analysis and quantitative lexical analysis. As we accumulate larger data sets and our algorithms get sharper, we can expect to see things like better propensity modeling anchored with omnichannel data.
Cogito is already working with teams of hundreds of employees at companies like Aetna, Humana and BlueCross BlueShield. Customers have reported a 15 percent decrease in average call time and a 10 percent decrease in the average number of callbacks.
The simple reality is that most data analytics solutions do a really good job at the quantitative part, but fall short when it comes to influencing real-world best practices. There’s an API for just about everything these days, but doing behavioral nudges right takes an immense amount of data and a very low margin for error. A few misplaced recommendations, especially when used by managers for evaluation, can result in disengaged employees and strained customer relationships.
Joshua Feast, CEO and co-founder of Cogito, believes that one of the best things about the American entrepreneurial ecosystem is the innate competitiveness of large players. He says that fear of disruption has had a lasting impact on the willingness of corporates to give new technologies a chance. For Feast, the most challenging part of his role at Cogito is managing product development, not getting in the door at potential clients.
At first, the thought of a behavioral nudge can seem condescending, but in the right context it can be helpful. Nobody likes to be told what they already know — if a customer service agent is speaking louder because a customer is hard of hearing, they do not need to be reminded about rapport. In the event that an abnormal conversation isn’t even recognized by the agent, a service like Cogito can be informative rather than pejorative. Take for example automobile technologies that can detect deviations between steering wheel movement and road markings and advise drivers to take a break. Despite nearly universal disdain for backseat driving, such nudges can not only be lifesaving but appreciated.
To this purpose, Cogito has raised $7.5 million since 2007, with the bulk of the money coming from a $5.5 million Series A in 2015 led by Romulus Capital. While Feast recognizes the large size of the market, he stresses the importance of a clear focus. The company is working with Salesforce, and is focused on putting the product in the hands of healthcare and insurance agents.",2016-08-16,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/speech-data-conversation.png?w=738,"omnichannel,nudge,e-commerce,cogito",Cogito leverages human behavior to nudge customer relationships
586,Lora Kolodny,"A startup called Polybit has introduced what it’s calling the Standard Library of the Internet in open beta, a resource to make back-end coding easy for developers, even beginners.
The Standard Library, or the “stdlib” as the startup is calling it, allows developers to upload the functions they write to the cloud, and make their “microservices” or logic portable, and re-usable, no server management required.
Polybit founder and Keith Horwood earlier created Nodal, the open source node JS framework. He said, “I was pretty invested in the back end, API space for so long. Now my goal is to make it so software developers never have to worry about infrastructure whatsoever.”
It’s a complex process to write code and make it accessible to millions online today, Horwood explained. It involves implementing the logic you want to write, figuring out how to host it online, putting it on a server (and most likely paying some company to do this for you), then constantly worrying about your servers and how to make sure the web service you built can be discovered by developers.
The Standard Library is a repository of functions, the building blocks of any application, that lets developers make the functions they write instantly accessible online.
Here’s an example of a function Horwood shared from the stdlib. It shows Rio Olympics gold medal standings.
A developer could grab this “microservice,” and change the country name from Canada to any other quickly, or alter it to show the top 5 countries by medals won so far.
Other examples of what people can build and share on stdlib, he said would be: functions that connect hardware to the cloud, or relay info to third parties, or manipulate data. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrwTGq6SbE
Horwood thinks that making functions available online easily will also help IT teams to address the “de-prioritized” requests within a given organization.
If a sales team wants IT to take disorganized customer data to score potential leads and generate a spreadsheet, that’s not as important as keeping a company’s critical e-mail and benefits systems running. But the Standard Library may hold pre-built software packages that can be quickly adapted for that sales team’s needs.
While Polybit’s Standard Library has been in open beta for just about a week, it has already seen 500 functions deployed by approximately 1,500 registered users. The stdlib also has access to all of NPM’s 300,000 node.js software packages, Horwood noted.
Polybit is a graduate of the AngelPad accelerator.

587,Anthony Ha,"Vettery, a startup offering an alternative to the traditional recruiting process, has raised $9 million in Series A funding.
On the Vettery website, the company pairs potential job-seekers with a “talent executive” who helps them through the process of creating a profile and looking over interview requests from employers. If they accept a job, Vettery will give them a $1,000 signing bonus.
From the employer’s side, meanwhile, Vettery is supposed to be superior because it allows them to browse candidates and request interviews without having to go through a recruiter.
Vettery launched last year in New York, and co-founder Adam Goldstein (pictured above with co-founder Brett Adcock) said it quickly expanded from newer startups to more established ones, and then to large enterprises. There are currently 1,500 companies hiring through Vettery, including eBay, Amazon and JP Morgan.

The Series A was led by Greycroft Partners and Raine Ventures, and according to Goldstein, will accelerate the company’s expansion into San Francisco (where it launched about two months ago), help it move into new industries (it’s currently focused on tech and finance) and allow it to expand the product team, with the aim of building integrations with existing HR tools.
“One of the things we thought about was expanding across multiple cities really quickly, but we just have seen so much interest from traditional companies — it’s not just the early adopters like startups that are interested,” Goldstein said. “It’s really shifted our strategy to start to look at other verticals.”",2016-08-16,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/vettery-image-8-16-16.jpg?w=738,"hiring,raine-ventures,greycroft-partners,vettery",Vettery raises $9M as it expands its hiring marketplace to San Francisco
588,Brian Heater,"Your speech-recognizing friends at Nuance are back with a major update to their flagship app, Dragon. The popular productivity software is now in its 15th version, an update that promises some substantial improvements in accuracy courtesy of the company’s own deep learning tech, which forms the basis of its speech engine.
According to Nuance, this latest upgrade brings better accuracy “upwards of 24 percent,” with improved ability to recognize and learn accents and voice patterns, while adapting to the acoustics of the speaker’s environment.

Here’s a quote from the company’s CTO, “Training such Deep Neural Net models typically requires large amounts of training data and a high-performance computing environment. However, our new Dragon portfolio includes our latest breakthrough that allows Dragon’s Deep Neural Nets to continuously learn from the user’s speech during use on a standard personal computer, and drive accuracy rates in some instances up to 24 percent higher.”
Version 15 also brings a simplified UI, formatting improvements, more support for audio transcription and optimization for a number of touchscreen Windows PCs. And as per usual, there are a whole slew of different editions of the software, tailored to various usages. The list includes Dragon Professional Individual, version 15; Dragon Legal Individual, version 15; and Dragon Professional Individual for Mac, version 6.

589,Ron Miller,"In a year where money is harder to come by, especially from conventional venture capital sources, Rubrik is a notable exception, announcing a $61 million Series C round from several brand-named Silicon Valley venture firms.
The round was led by Khosla Ventures with participation from existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners and Greylock Partners, and unnamed angel investors coming back for more. Today’s investment brings the total raised to $112 million.
What is causing venture capitalist firms to shower this company with so much money? “We are not just doing well,” Rubrik CEO Bipul Sinha tells TechCrunch. “We are doing exceedingly well.” It may sound like bragging or hyperbole, but he says the company has been growing in leaps and bounds to the tune of 100 percent quarter over quarter in both revenue and customer numbers. He says he’s seeing $250,000 deals closing in just 76 days.
When we covered the company’s $40 million round last May, Rubrik had 20 employees. In 15 months since, they’ve added 140 more including teams in Europe and Asia/Pacific.
As Sinha pointed out, Series A and B funding tends to be based on a company’s potential. By Series C, you need to start to show some ability to scale and take the company to the next level. He says, he sees a company that’s on its way to becoming a $10-15 billion company.
While he admits, it’s going to take blood, sweat and tears to get there, he says that investors are seeing a company with strong metrics and a path to bigger growth — and the round reflects that.
Rubrik runs what it calls a cloud data management platform. Its claim to fame is the ability to manage content wherever it lives, whether in the cloud or on-premises. This type of flexibility is in high demand as companies balance a hybrid environment where some data lives on prem and some in the cloud.
While the cloud part is limited to AWS and Azure for now, that covers quite a bit of the market at present and the company could begin to add additional vendor support with the kind of money it got today to throw at development. Sinha says that given that his target market is just beginning to move data to the cloud, the timing and abilities of his company’s solutions are lining up nicely with the market — and sales are reflecting that.
The solution uses a data appliance stored on prem in the customer’s data center to manage the backups, taking care of standard backup chores like de-duplication and archiving and compliance, while distributing the backup wherever the client wishes. Some may live entirely on-prem today, but want that ability to go to the cloud in the future, or they may be mixing cloud services with on-prem tools — and Rubrik gives them a modern option to do that, while protecting their legacy investments.
What truly separates Rubrik from the pack, according to Sinha, is the ability to retrieve files instantly from the cloud, something he says is lacking in legacy solutions from companies like EMC, NetApp and Commvault, and even pure cloud backup from AWS or other cloud services.
With $61 million in Series C and some market proof points in place, Sinha is understandably confident, but now comes the hard part — taking that money and investing wisely to build a successful organization that can upset the backup status quo. Time will tell if Rubrik is up for the challenge.",2016-08-16,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-135205230.jpg?w=738,"hybrid-cloud,backup,rubrik",Rubrik snares $61 million Series C led by Khosla Ventures
590,John Mannes,"Business analytics platform BeyondCore will be officially joining Salesforce, according to a blog post by BeyondCore CEO Arijit Sengupta. BeyondCore is an enterprise analytics tool that bolsters business intelligence with computational and statistical analysis.
While Salesforce could have gone fishing and come up with a number of business intelligence companies to buy, BeyondCore was already integrated with the Salesforce platform.
“We decided to show off our integration into Salesforce, which would be part of our upcoming BeyondCore 7 release,” said Sengupta in the post.
Salesforce has an active corporate development team and has eaten at least nine companies this year, including three since the middle of last month.
The company’s $750 million acquisition of Quip places Microsoft squarely within their line of sight. Quip enables cloud-based word processing. Interestingly, BeyondCore consistently touts its integration with Microsoft Office. That said, there is little indication that BeyondCore will completely dissolve into Salesforce.
“We’ll continue to deliver our innovative technology to customers as part of Salesforce and deliver the same great service you’ve come to expect from us,” reiterated Sengupta.
Sengupta founded BeyondCore back in 2004 and raised a cumulative $9 million in financing from Menlo Ventures in a Series A back in 2014.
The transaction comes at a time of regular M&A activity in the Valley. A number of transactions, including Quip, came with at-least leaks of massive acquisition values, but an even greater number have not produced anything in the way of financial headlines. BeyondCore and Salesforce declined to comment on the specifics of this deal that’s expected to close later this year.
Some speculate this is the result of a cooling in valuations and a need for exits. However, it’s important to remember that not every transaction will fit neatly in a box.
“Acquisitions can still fill holes in the cloud space,” said Brent Leary, co-founder and partner at CRM Essentials. “Being able to more seamlessly integrate data analytics with cloud components fills a hole.”
Whether the transaction will turn out to be a critical key in an assault against Microsoft, or simply a strategic acquihire is yet to be seen. Until then, we will be eating popcorn waiting for the next Salesforce acquisition.",2016-08-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/beyondcore.jpg?w=738,"salesforce-com,cloud-applications,beyondcore",Another Salesforce acquisition with BeyondCore enterprise analytics grab
591,Lora Kolodny,"DroneDeploy released a new study of the commercial and industrial drones market this week, revealing bad news for the makers of fixed-wing drones — quadcopters are far outpacing this type of unmanned aerial vehicle in every industry.
Fixed-wing drones, like the SenseFly eBee Ag, 3DR Aero-M and PrecisionHawk Lancaster, promise performance benefits, including endurance and ruggedness.
A fixed-wing drone can fly farther and cover a greater area on a single charge than multi-rotor counterparts, generally. But they are also used in just 6 percent of the flights for commercial and industrial purposes, DroneDeploy found.
Meanwhile, quadcopters, which promise to be easier for drone operators to control in flight and allow for rapid takeoff, are used pervasively.
DroneDeploy CEO and co-founder Mike Winn explained, “People would rather fly a quadcopter multiple times over a large area, or stop to change batteries, than go through the process of assembling a fixed-wing drone before a flight.”
Thankfully, most manufacturers of fixed-wing drones for commercial and industrial use have also developed quadcopters or other multi-rotor models.
The DroneDeploy study also found that commercial and industrial users of drones mapped 3 million acres of land in the past four months alone. That compares to mapping fewer than 2 million acres of land in the entire year before that.
Agriculture is using drones more than any other industry, so far, followed by construction. But the fastest growth in adoption of drones is seen in mining, inspection and oil and gas.
New industries are finding uses for drones, these days, including: education, emergency services and real estate, though institutions in these industries were barely even testing drones just one year ago.
And in the past year, the drone hardware most used in this market came from DJI; SenseFly (a Parrot-owned company); 3DR; AgEagle and Parrot, respectively. The most popular drone-camera tech in the market came from DJI, Canon, Sony, GoPro and Mapir.
DroneDeploy provides software and systems to help organizations use drones for commercial and industrial purposes of any kind, from mapping and measuring traffic, to surveillance and venue security, to spraying crops and monitoring crop health from on high.
The company based its study on the drone-related activities of its customers in 130 countries over the past 16 months.",2016-08-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/dji-phantom-3-pro-drone.jpg?w=738,"commercial-drones,dronedeploy,drones","Fixed-wing drones not quite taking off in commercial market, a new DroneDeploy study finds"
592,Ron Miller,"Workday announced a 7-year cloud infrastructure deal with IBM Softlayer today to run their development and testing services on IBM’s cloud, handing IBM a huge win in the process.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.
It’s a big deal from a number of perspectives. First of all, it’s the size and scope of the deal, running seven years. Secondly, it’s a big-name SaaS vendor moving a big part of its workload to IBM’s cloud and forgoing a big competitor such as Google or Microsoft (or even sticking with AWS).
Workday runs parts of its business on AWS, but it chose to go with IBM for this aspect of its business, which could lead to additional business, reasons R Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst at Constellation Research.
“While this isn’t the production workload, it could lead to the shift from Amazon to IBM and that’s the big question — if you have test and development, why not production as well?,” he asked.
Workday, which sells cloud ERP software had originally looked at HP, but when they got out of the cloud business, Workday had to look elsewhere, according to Wang. He says that Google and Microsoft weren’t really options because in the case of Microsoft, it already offers Dynamics ERP (cloud and on-prem) and Google could be looking to move into this space, as well. Workday wanted to stay away from vendors who could potentially compete with them, Wang explained.
“Workday doesn’t want to be beholden to another competitor. It’s their biggest fear and IBM isn’t competing with Workday,” he said.
As for IBM, it brings the company a big-name cloud client into the fold, as it tries to compete with AWS, Google and Microsoft in the cloud infrastructure market. IBM is ahead of Google in third place in the latest marketshare numbers provided by Synergy Research.
 
But not all analysts agree with Synergy. A recent report from Gartner indicated IBM wasn’t doing as well as Synergy’s numbers suggested. Regardless, this deal should be good news for Big Blue.

593,Brian Heater,"The last decade-plus hasn’t been great for SGI. The company formerly known as Silicon Graphics declared Chapter 11 in 2009. That same year, it was sold to Rackable for a song, with that company somewhat confusingly changing its own name to SGI (short for Silicon Graphics International) during the process.
Now former competitor Hewlett Packard Enterprise (which spun out from HP last year) is picking up the whole kit and caboodle for around $275 million, a price tag that includes both cash and company debt. That all works out to $7.75 a share.
In its current state, the server and high-performance computer maker employees 1,100 people internationally.

But for the longest time, the company couldn’t get a foothold in the quickly growing cloud computing business while competitors like Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft Azure were growing rapidly. To right this ship, Google brought in Diane Greene by acquiring her startup BeBop Technologies for $348 million last year and named her its VP of Google Cloud Enterprise.
Greene will join us at Disrupt SF in September to talk about Google’s ambitions in the cloud and how she plans to bring more enterprises onto Google’s platform.
Few people have Greene’s experience in the enterprise. Before striking out on her own again with bebop, she was the CEO of VMware, where she oversaw deals like that company’s acquisition by EMC. She shepherded VMware through its IPO in 2007 and then left in 2008.
Greene joined Google’s board of directors in 2012, so she’s no stranger to the company and its overall vision.

596,John Mannes,"Among other things, CareSkore wants to use machine learning to anticipate mortality. However, the newly endowed platform is more than just a Facebook poll that tells you how you’ll meet your end this Christmas by being squashed by a falling piano.

Storm ventures, Cota Capital, Rising Tide Fund and Liquid 2 Ventures are rallying behind the Y Combinator graduate with today’s $4.5 million seed round.
CareSkore is combining clinical, socio-economic, demographic, and behavioral data to paint a holistic picture of patients that doctors and insurance companies can use to provide better preventative care.
The platform is leveraging Google’s TensorFlow and Hadoop to cut through massive third party data sets and generate insights by finding relationships between environmental and clinical data.
From a data-science perspective, CareSkore uses ensemble learning techniques like random forest analysis to combine various statistical models to produce a less noisy, more accurate result.
The platform can inform doctors of patients who are most likely to skip an appointment and who are likely to forget or intentionally fail to take medication on time. In addition to mortality risk, the platform analyzes readmission risk, fall risk, and infection risk by taking into account patient charts on file with hospitals and doctors offices. Doctors can use this information to inform their work, and proactively reach out to patients with appropriate recommendations and additional services.
Patients receive personalized text messages or phone calls gently nudging them to take action if a new risk factor emerges. CareSkore offers disease specific templates for conditions like COPD and diabetes that can make care recommendations. Patients can also use the system to inform doctors of new symptoms or questions about a condition or care plan. Information is passed on to social workers who ensure information gets to the right person. In many cases, data is fed back through the system to inform future CareSkore predictions.
The space is hot, with a number of players opting for different angles to enter the market. Predilytics got acquired by Welltok last year, but the company focuses more on health risk management than direct patient communication.
Third-party intelligence is where CareSkore looks to set itself apart from other analytics platforms like Ayasdi and Optum. CareSkore uses 23 environmental data sources, including Google Maps and Google APIs, to contextualize patient data.

While it would seem lucrative for the company to repackage data for insurance companies to incorporate into premium analysis, Jas Grewal, CEO of CareSkore, is perfectly happy sticking directly with the healthcare market. The relationship the company has with insurers is focused on supporting preventative care. If insurance companies can make the same proactive efforts as doctors, everyone benefits from reduced claims.
Since graduating from Y Combinator, Grewal has brought in $1.2 million in revenue from signed contracts. Another $3.4 million in revenue is sitting in the pipeline to be processed before the end of the year. The company’s SaaS model is based on the number of admissions for both in-patient and out-patient care charged monthly, quarterly or yearly in addition to a one-time up-front implementation fee.
In addition to long sales cycles in the healthcare industry, CareSkore also has to grapple with implementation hurdles. Grewal wants to reduce the on-boarding time for new clients from two to three months down to a few weeks. Without a standard format for patient data, the company has to convert some legacy patient tracking systems into a format usable by the platform. Fortunately, four large companies including Meditech control 80 percent of the hospital market and CareSkore is working to lock down partnerships with all four.
With the Affordable Care Act, the market has shifted to incentivize just about everyone to focus on preventative care.
“There has been a push from the regulatory side in this direction,” noted Arun Penmetsa, a Principal at Storm Ventures. “The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has made a push toward using quality as the leading metric for reimbursement.”
If Grewal and his early team of 15 can nail the execution, the M&A market remains hot for smart applications of data science that can support patient care and bridge the gap between the home and the hospital.",2016-08-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/careskoreproductdevices.png?w=738,"storm-ventures,meditech,ayasdi",CareSkore gets $4.3M to bring machine learning to preventive care
597,Matthew Lynley,"Abhinav Shashank was working on an academic project at Harvard with his colleagues Kanav Hasija and Sandeep Gupta — figuring out how to pool together large data sets from hundreds of different sources and APIs and manage them — when his business colleagues started asking him to help apply those tools.
The result was Innovaccer, a set of software that mashes together data from different enterprise sources and online data sets (ranging from Oracle data, SQL databases to social media feeds) to bring together a large database where companies can build application layers. That technology has seen applications ranging from health care to media, but the core remains the same: getting all the relevant data in one place where businesses can divine the information they need to best operate.
To do that, Innovaccer has raised $15.6 million led by Westbridge Capital Partners. The goal is basically to provide businesses with a white-labeled tool to apply high-level data analysis of large sets of data pulled from multiple different sources. With the right approach, firms can build tools to point that activity in pretty much any direction they want.
“The core platform remains the same, which is basically the integration, the data management layer and the dashboard,” Shashank said. “You don’t end up using iOS or Android, you end up using Gmail and Uber. From an application layer standpoint there are a few changes you need to do from what media wants to measure to what a healthcare wants to measure, versus what a bunch of other companies want to measure.”
Keeping an advantage is going to be a race against time. Innovaccer has to ensure it can very quickly onboard new data integrations and provide easy tools to apply new kinds of applications on top of them. If not, it’ll just be another piece of software in the stack that will collect dust in the corner while firms stick with more reliable, typical suppliers of this kind of technology.
The company has already seen applications in various fields like health care, where pooling data from multiple sources allows firms to create tools like electronic health records systems and a comprehensive patient overview. Innovaccer’s goal is to create a central piece of technology that can be morphed into something that’s industry-specific, while still constantly being improved by adding new sources of data.

There is plenty of competition for tools like this. There are many applications that focus on those specific industries — like electronic medial record systems in health care, for example — and other companies that provide high-level analytics like Palantir or IBM. Innovaccer’s challenge will be to ensure that it can prove it has enough core data to justify getting firms to build application layers on top of it, and that the data they have is more valuable and more useful than what businesses might find in other services.",2016-08-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/pipeline.jpg?w=738,lightspeed-venture-partners,Innovaccer raises $15.6M to give businesses one stop for all their data
598,John Mannes,"Silk‘s co-founder and CEO, Salar al Khafaji, announced today that private data analytics unicorn Palantir would be acquiring the company.
The transaction appears to be an acqui-hire, with members of the Silk team directly joining Palantir in new roles. Founded in 2010, Silk helps data journalists, activists, NGOs and businesses produce data visualizations in the cloud without the need for complex software and programming knowledge.
“Silk.co as a platform will continue to operate,” said Khafaji in a blog post. “Nothing will change to current Silks, and you can still create a new Silk for free.”
The Silk team noted that it was willing to transition to work on “even bigger and more important data problems,” signaling that the deal is likely not indicative of any new consumer pivot for Palantir. The $20 billion Palantir produces data analytics solutions for the U.S. government to aid in counterterrorism, as well as a platform for the financial services industry to support fraud detection.
Silk raised three small incremental rounds of financing totaling $3.66 million from NEA and others between 2011 and 2013.
As a result of today’s announced transaction, there won’t be anyone left to operate the Silk platform, amidst assurances that all Silk data will remain secure and proprietary.
“Silk.co will operate ‘as is’ and we will not be able to provide technical or customer support to new or existing Silk accounts any longer, nor will we be doing any further development work or adding new features to the hosted Silk.co product.”
We have reached out to both Khafaji and the Palantir team and will update this post with comments when we get them.",2016-08-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/palantir-silk2.png?w=738,"silk,valuation,palantir-technologies,unicorn",Palantir acquires data visualization startup Silk
599,Romain Dillet,"Service-level agreements (SLAs) are key when it comes to choosing a service that is going to play an important part for your own service. Cloud hosting services have an SLA, software-as-a-service products have an SLA, even airlines have SLAs. Software-as-a-service startup Algolia just revamped its SLA, and it’s interesting to see how the company is wording its policy.
SLAs are simple: if a service goes down, the provider agrees to pay you back to compensate for the inconvenience. But some services make SLAs hard to understand, and you don’t really know what you’re getting if a service goes down. For something critical, you want to make sure that a service is willing to pay a lot of money if it goes down — it’s the best way to know that it is serious about staying up nearly 100 percent of the time.
And yet, downtimes happen. Even big companies suffer from downtime. So 100 percent of service availability is just wishful thinking. You want a company’s word that it is going to do everything possible to fight downtime.
Algolia is a critical real-time search API that powers many of the services that you use and love. If Algolia goes down, you won’t be able to search for stuff on Medium, Twitch, Periscope or CrunchBase.
Those big clients want to make sure that Algolia is making everything possible to stay up. Otherwise, it becomes a trust issue and you’re going to look for another search provider.
Usually, services check every minute if everything is running smoothly. And yet, 59 seconds of downtime in a month means that you can theoretically only claim 99.9977 percent of uptime. Algolia wanted to go further.
So the company threw away all the usual monitoring services and built its own monitoring network that checks if everything is running fine every 30 seconds. This way, the company can provide a premium SLA.
If you’re a premium customer, “we replicate your search on at least three different machines hosted by three different providers in three different data centers with three autonomous systems using at least two different Tier1 upstream providers,” Adam Surak says. And the company promises 99.999 percent of uptime thanks to its monitoring network.
And instead of boring, complicated terms of services that tell you “for every minute of downtime, you’re eligible to blah blah blah,” Algolia has three charts that make it easy to understand what happens if the service goes down for 2 minutes, 20 minutes or 2 hours:
All of this information will sound useless if you aren’t using Algolia. But I feel like this is the kind of transparency that you should expect from your software-as-a-service provider. And I hope more companies will create this kind of charts to illustrate their SLAs.",2016-08-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/servers.jpg?w=738,"sla,algolia",Algolia wants to bring transparency to service-level agreements
600,Ingrid Lunden,"As LinkedIn inches closer to completing its $26 billion acquisition by Microsoft, smaller rivals have stepped up their game building viable alternatives for those who might want more independent products when it comes to managing contacts in their professional networks. FullContact — one such competitor — has now raised a further $25 million.
The funding brings the total raised by Denver-based FullContact to just under $45 million. FullContact’s co-founder and CEO Bart Lorang said the company is not disclosing its valuation.
The big elephant in the room for FullContact is LinkedIn. Fast approaching 450 million users, the company is one of the bigger players in the area of online professional identity and has become the go-to place for people looking to connect with people in their professional networks. On its own it was already a competitive threat, and its acquisition by Microsoft may be even more so, as it speaks to the bigger company’s ambitions to leverage LinkedIn’s social networking in its own enterprise-focused products, from sales through to productivity services.
But rather than wilting under the obvious challenges that this poses to FullContact and others in the space, FullContact’s CEO has a more constructive view on the deal and what it means for his startup.
“The LinkedIn acquisition demonstrates the power of the single ID and a unified contact record in the ecosystem,” Lorang said in an interview.
The key thing for him is that Microsoft remains a proprietary platform, and LinkedIn has not demonstrated itself to be particularly happy to share its data with the rest of that ecosystem, either. “FullContact’s strategy is to create an open platform that is owned by humanity. We allow and invite developers to integrate with our platform, unlike LinkedIn. It has been rather closed off. They very much want to build a wall,” he added a little mischievously, borrowing a phrase more commonly (and controversially) associated with something and someone else. 
Led by Foundry Group with participation from Baird Capital, Shea Ventures and Blue Note, FullContact’s latest round will be used for acquisition — “I see a lot of distressed startups out there in our wider field unable to raise more money for sure,” said Lorang; and also hiring, business development, and adding in new features that will expand FullContact beyond contact management and into new areas.
One of those new features, Lorang said, sounds like a way to use your contact information in FullContact’s database as an identity card across the wider web.
“We have quietly been working on FullContact Connect, our next-generation platform capabilities where you will have your own ID, your own contact record, and you can use it to consume and control content online,” he said. “We are working on that. We do have ambitions.”
Founded in 2010 in Denver (where it is still based), FullContact has built itself out as one of a group of companies that is trying to tackle the issue of managing contacts that you make through your normal business life, as well as growing that list through intelligent searches based on the people you already know, and turning piecemeal contact info into more complete profiles.
The company has its own primary data that it augments with data from across the web, and using algorithms — both built in-house and also picked up by way of acquisition of competitors like Brewster — it merges all of it to create a database of some 40 billion contacts that its users can access. (FullContact does not disclose its actual user numbers, except to say that they are in the ‘millions.’)
FullContact today makes revenues from three categories of customers: individuals, businesses and software developers. It taps the first of these groups via freemium-style iPhone and Android apps that let you do things like scan and digitize business cards and then augment that information with more data about those people.
Meanwhile, the business and developer solutions let third parties tap into FullContact’s database by way of APIs to help create more complete customer profiles. The latter of these is a smart area for the company to develop to pick up developers and others who found themselves in a lurch when LinkedIn shut down similar API functionality in 2015.
Ironically, while FullContact has built its business on the concept of being able to enhance contact information, another area where Lorang also agreed it might move in years ahead might be in helping manage that info for those who don’t want it out in the open.
This is a trend that we see picking up some speed with the recent surge in interest in online privacy and data protection. For example, in Europe, you have the “right to be forgotten” development, where Google and other search engines are required to remove search links on people’s names when requested to do so by those individuals.
“I love the trend of being more transparent,” said Lorang. While Lorang said you can already claim and manage a profile on FullContact, it’s now working on ways of expanding that to other data repositories. “We are just starting to roll out that type of capability to remove yourself,” he said. “You’ll see more from us on this in the next year.”
For now, FullContact and its investors are happy to keep the startup in Denver and well outside the Valley bubble to grow. 
“With over 40 billion contact records under management, FullContact was already on track to more than double recurring revenue for the fourth straight year,” said Brad Feld, MD of the Foundry Group, in a statement. “The funding will be used to support the company’s rapid growth by further expanding sales, marketing and engineering as well as pursuing strategic acquisitions that bolster our technology and data assets.”",2016-08-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/3122900531_8d3883f542_b.jpg?w=738,"shea-ventures,baird-capital,foundry-group,fullcontact",FullContact raises $25M more to take on LinkedIn in contact management
601,Frederic Lardinois,"Mirantis, which specializes in offering software, support and training for running OpenStack, today announced that it is partnering with Germany-based SUSE, best known for its Linux distribution, to offer its customers support for SUSE’s enterprise Linux offering. The two companies also said that they will work on making SUSE Linux Enterprise Server a development platform for use with Mirantis OpenStack. What’s even more important, though, is that the two companies will also work together to support Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS.
All of this may sound rather odd at first. Why, after all, would Mirantis want to offer support for these competing distributions, especially given that both SUSE and Red Hat offer their own OpenStack solutions, too. In reality, though, few companies only run one Linux distribution.
“Many of our larger customers run two or three different Linux flavors. Now OpenStack users can get support for their major Linux distributions in one place from Mirantis,” said Mirantis co-founder and CMO, Boris Renski, in a canned statement today. “Thousands of enterprises worldwide across major industries count on SUSE because they offer enterprise-grade, high reliability, bet-your-business service level agreements. Partnering with SUSE gives Mirantis customers access to this support as they build their private cloud.”
Similarly, SUSE’s president of Strategy, Alliances and Marketing Michael Miller told me that his company doesn’t believe in locking in its users. He also added that “where OpenStack is right now, we have to put aside the politics.” In his view OpenStack is still in the early adopter phase and it’s still too complex to deploy and manage. At the same time, the project is also still adjusting to all of the emerging technologies like containers and network function virtualization that sprung up shortly after the OpenStack project launched.
Mirantis’ OpenStack distribution is currently optimized for using CentOS (as the default OS for running the Fuel OpenStack deployment and management service) and Ubuntu (for running the OpenStack nodes). The latest versions of Mirantis already allowed you to use Red Hat Enterprise Linux as OpenStack compute nodes (because the open-source Fuel tool also did), but Mirantis did not offer support for these installs.",2016-08-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img_20160809_103941.jpg?w=738,"red-hat,suse,mirantis,openstack",Mirantis and SUSE team up to give OpenStack users new support options
602,Ron Miller,"Today, Pingpad, which launched last year as a consumer mobile app, did an about-face, announcing it has built a collaboration tool on top of the popular Slack enterprise communications platform. It shut down the consumer mobile app recently to concentrate on this approach.
Ross Mayfield, one of the founders of PingPad, has been around since the earliest days of Enterprise 2.0, founding Socialtext, an early proponent of enterprise collaboration tools that mimicked the ease of web-based tools like blogs and wikis emerging in the early 2000s.
Mayfield is building on that earlier experience to give users something he sees lacking in Slack, an integrated collaboration tool, and he’s taking a page from those early days by providing a Wiki to give team members more context and structure than they could derive from a linear Slack conversation.
The new tool is essentially a Slack bot that captures the conversations and converts it into an organized, searchable and usable document.
The bot can automatically extract information from the conversation and add it to the document on the fly or users can add content to the Wiki with a few simple Slack commands such as /note to write a note.
Slack has succeeded in enterprise collaboration where so many before it failed by building an open communications platform that’s friendly to developers and watching it grow. Pingpad, which began this pivot as an experimental side project, sees great promise in hitching its wagon to Slack.
As for a business model, Pingpad is free for up to 100 notes per team. After that it’s $4.00 per user per month with unlimited support.
Mayfield sees a lot of similarities between what Slack is doing and what he did with Socialtext Signals, a micro blogging tool back in the day. “A lot of the features Slack is building, like message buttons were things we built in Socialtext Signals. We had a good integration story where you could integrate it with third-party apps, have notifications flow in, the ability to interact with them and even change data through a message sent as a signal to an underlying system of record,” he explained.
For whatever reason, tools like Socialtext, which launched in 2002 and was sold in 2012 to Peoplefluent, couldn’t capture enterprise marketshare in the way Slack has to this point.
Mayfield admits there are inherent risks in tying his company to another’s platform, but he sees the obvious connection and he thinks it’s worth the gamble. For a guy who has been at this for 14 years, he seen more than a few attempts and believes this approach can work.
He hints the Wiki is just the first step, and if this takes off, you could see other tools and stand-alone mobile apps down the road.",2016-08-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-184313618.jpg?w=738,"bots,enterprise-collaboration,pingpad",Pingpad hitches wagon to Slack with new collaboration tool aimed at enterprise
603,Ingrid Lunden,"The use of Hadoop-based open source big-data technology continues to grow among enterprises, and today MapR Technologies, one of the bigger startups in the space, has announced another $50 million in funding to secure its place as a leading vendor and gear up for an IPO.
The investment is being led by Future Fund — Australia’s sovereign wealth fund — and also includes participation from MapR’s existing investors Google Capital (which led its last round of $110 million), Lightspeed Venture Partners, Mayfield Fund, New Enterprise Associates, Qualcomm Ventures, and Redpoint Ventures.
MapR is not disclosing its valuation, CEO and founder John Schroeder told me in an interview.
“I’m having fun running a private company for a little bit longer,” he said. “But the valuation was driven around comparative valuations for companies like Splunk [which is currently valued at $8.44 billion].” By this, he means something broader than a straight Hadoop play. “It’s a broad platform”
He also debunked the idea of how many companies do tout valuations without explaining what is behind them. “Many of the funding rounds have terms, and I could dial in any valuation I want with ratchets. Valuations can be very misleading,” he said, adding that the only thing more he would say about it is this: “Our cap table is in fantastic shape and way better than many other companies that went public recently, and employees will benefit from a future IPO because of that.
For some context, MapR’s last round valued it at more than $1 billion. The company has now raised $194 million to date in equity, with another $30 million in debt financing.
The Hadoop market is largely a three-horse race between MapR, Cloudera and Hortonworks. Cloudera has to date raised over $1 billion; and while Hortonworks had a strong public listing debut in 2014, it has more recently been taking a hit after missing analysts’ estimates and reporting widening losses earlier this month (its market cap is currently around $435 million).
With that in mind, MapR — which also taps and converges data in Spark and NoSQL, among other technologies — is in a somewhat enviable position: the company is growing well while steering clear of some of the pressures that might come with larger a financing load or a public-company profile.
MapR describes its last quarter as a “record” for the company, with a 100 percent increase in bookings compared to a year ago, with licenses and support agreements (the mainstay of the company’s business model) accounting for 90 percent of total bookings. It also said it had “multiple” license transactions of $5 million or more, although it doesn’t spell out total revenues.
Its customer list includes a strong roster of large corporations — underscoring just how widely used Apache Hadoop-based big data services are becoming. They include American Express, Audi, Ericsson, JLL, Mizuho Bank, NTT, Philips, Qualcomm, and Rubicon Project.
“Our ongoing momentum is fueled by a world-class team that is driving innovation and growth across every facet of our organization,” said Schroeder in a statement. “This new funding strengthens our balance sheet as we look ahead to an initial public offering.”
On the subject of an IPO, the company has been making some noises already this year, and tody Schroeder told me that a likely date at the moment appears to be the beginning of 2017.
“We’ve been beating [our and investors’] expectations for many quarters, and we should be in a position for an IPO by the beginning of next year,” he said. “We’ve been encouraged by Twilio and Talend. Investors want to put money to work; they just want the right companies to to invest in.”
Perhaps more interesting is the fact that MapR is keen on an IPO at all.
“The investment bankers we’re working with come by with pitchbooks, and ask us, ‘why would you want to go public anyway?'” he said when I asked him the same question.
“Historically it’s obvious. It’s a marketing event, it gives you access to more capital and the transparency can be a positive thing if you have good results. But today it is a harder question because you have many companies like the Uber’s of the world that are changing the rules. I scratch my head about what makes the most sense. I still think the norm will be that the majority of companies will go public and maybe we’re just going through a phase where they are not.”
As for why it chose to tap Australia’s sovereign wealth fund for this latest funding round, Schroeder says it fit both with the Future Fund looking to expand its investment activities, and MapR doing a lot more on the investor relations front lately, speaking with LPs at the VCs that already back MapR.
More generally, the company opened offices in the country in 2014 to serve Australia and New Zealand, and it has been making moves to establish itself as a key partner for businesses opting to use Hadoop-based big data analytics as part of their operations.
“Enterprise computing is going through one of the biggest transformations in decades and companies that are serious about leveraging data as a disruptive advantage are relying on MapR,” said Barry Eggers, managing partner, Lightspeed Venture Partners, in a statement. “The company has consistently demonstrated strong growth over several years and we believe its technology lead will continue to drive its success.”",2016-08-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/darpa_big_data.jpg?w=738,,Hadoop vendor MapR raises another $50M as it sets its sights on IPO
604,Darrell Etherington,"Snapchat has given observers another reason to suspect it might be working on hardware – the social network company joined the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) according to the Financial Times. The SIG industry association maintains the Bluetooth wireless standard, and membership is a necessary prerequisite for companies that want to employ Bluetooth in any hardware devices.
Snapchat is an “adopter” in the SIG, which is a free tier that provides member companies with a license to build Bluetooth-enabled products, and to work with other Bluetooth SIG makers on collaborative efforts. AS the FT notes, the only cure for companies to join the SIG, generally speaking, is if they intend to actually launch a wireless device.
Other companies dealing primarily in software are members of the SIG, however, including Facebook. But Facebook has dabbled in hardware previously, including with a project last year where it offered free Bluetooth beacons to business owners as part of a wireless, location-based ambient advertising push.
Snapchat’s own hardware plans including Bluetooth tech might be more ambitious; the FT report notes that it has recently done a lot to suggest an interest in augmented reality hardware, including the acquisition of AR headset startup Vergence Lab, recent hires and a number of acquisitions in computer vision and AR software. A report earlier this year suggested Snapchat might already have begun developing a pair of smart glasses, potentially similar to Google Glass.
Snapchat has good reason to be interested in AR as a category; its smartphone app is scene by many as one of the most successful existing examples of consumer AR, mainly through the use of their image filters, which can be applied to live video captured by a user’s device camera.",2016-09-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/snapchatshades.jpg?w=738,"wireless,bluetooth","Snapchat joins the Bluetooth SIG, fueling hardware speculation"

606,Sarah Perez,"Facebook’s goal of tracking ads all the way through to a customer’s purchase at point-of-sale is getting a big boost today with a makeover of the Facebook Offers program. Now designed to be more mobile-friendly, Facebook is allowing businesses to create two kinds of offers – those customers can redeem online and those they redeem in-store – while also making it easier for customers to pull up the coupon they need at the register.
Facebook Offers launched back in 2012 as a way for Facebook advertisers to reach customers through campaigns designed to tap into the social network’s viral effect – that is, Offers could potentially be exposed to a broader audience than targeted, thanks to people sharing the deal with their friends.
Now, Facebook says it’s making it easier for advertisers to reach customers on mobile. Offers can be designed to be used online or at point-of-sale, and they can be shared either via an Offers ad or via the business’s Facebook Page. The ads will appear in the News Feed on both mobile and the web, and can be customized as other creatives can be – such as by using carousel ads, for example.
Meanwhile, businesses can use the Offer Page Composer to share an Offer on their Facebook Page.
For Page visitors, there will also now be a new “Offers” tab available so you can browse through the business’s past offers in a single location. This will make it easier to find the current coupons and discounts, without having to scroll down the Page to see what you may have missed.
Of course, tracking an Offer’s redemption online is easy, and the number of claims will be available to businesses in the ads reporting product, says Facebook.
The larger challenge, historically, has been connecting a Facebook ad to a real-world purchase. In the past, Facebook has done this by connecting advertisers with data provider partners, like Datalogix, Epsilon, Acxiom, and BlueKai to parse lists of consumers’ offline purchases. More recently, it announced partnerships with POS systems Square and Marketo that would help Facebook better understand when an ad led to purchase – or even a store visit, thanks to a feature that matches GPS, beacons, Wi-Fi, radio signals, and cell towers with a brick-and-mortar store’s coordinates.

Today, Facebook is bringing a similar level of tracking in-house. From the new Offers bookmark, shoppers will be able to quickly pull up the discount and then show their phone at the register, where the business can scan the provided barcode or QR code. This definitively connects the Facebook ad to the purchase.
Meanwhile, when shopping online, customers can easily copy the Offer code for use at checkout, and view the terms and conditions.
The company says it’s now working on unique offer codes that allow advertisers to create specific offers for individuals, in order to prevent mass distribution, or select groups – like the business’s best customers, for example.
Facebook also says it will remind people to use their Offers before they expire, and will be reminded on their next desktop visit about an Offer they claimed while on their phone.
The online Offer ads are live now, while in-store ads will be available in the coming weeks, Facebook notes.",2016-08-30,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/facebook-offers1.jpg?w=676,"offers,facebook-offers,ads","Facebook Offers gets revamped for mobile, now lets you track saved coupons in a dedicated section"
607,Anthony Ha,"After opening up its Amplify program last fall to a wide range of publishers, Twitter says it’s expanding the video ad program again, this time to individual creators.
After creators are approved for the program, the company says that when they’re about to tweet a video, they can just check a box to include a pre-roll ad, with the revenue split between Twitter and the creator. The company has not yet responded to my question about the revenue split, but it’s being reported as 70 precent for the creator and 30 percent for Twitter.
That means creators can decide whether to include ads on a video-by-video basis, or they can just turn it on for all of their videos. (Twitter also says it’s not asking for exclusivity.)
“Today, we’re excited to announce the expansion of our creator revenue programs, which will provide creators of all sizes with the ability to monetize content in multiple ways and generate revenue at scale,” said Twitter’s Guy Snir in a company blog post.

In addition, Twitter is announcing a new Media Studio for publishing videos and visual content. It will include a unified media library of all your videos, GIFs and images, as well as tools for scheduling tweets and managing teams.

608,Josh Constine,"Who decides who’s cool? Snapchat refuses to recommend accounts for fear of feeling heavy-handed. Maybe it learned from Twitter, whose old one-size-fits-none suggested user list immediately made it noisy, impersonal and ruled by an oligarchy. But Instagram is betting that algorithmically personalized suggestions could make its new ephemeral slideshow Stories feature addictive… even if your friends are boring.
Today, atop the Explore tab, Instagram will start showing some users a bar of Stories from accounts you could follow, with the feature rolling out to everyone soon. Based on who you follow and the topics you care about, the tailored recommendations will make it easy to add someone new to your Home feed’s Stories section.
The suggestions are sure to get plenty of attention because Explore is surprisingly popular. Instagram says 100 million people visit it every day — the first time it’s revealed a stat about Explore. That’s one-fifth of Instagram’s 500 million monthly users, and one-third of the app’s daily actives.

Instagram’s Director of Product Management Blake Barnes describes why people visit Explore, saying, “Some seek it out as the primary way they use Instagram…Some people view it as a dessert.”
Beyond being entertaining, Explore helps people keep their feed fresh with new accounts. That’s critical after six years of photo sharing. This follows Facebook’s strategy of using artificial intelligence for curation instead of humans, like it just started to with Trending Topics descriptions. Algorithmic suggestions will allow personalization of Explore Stories at scale.
When the tab was first launched, it was called Popular and merely showed the most Liked and commented-on posts across Instagram. That ended up too skewed toward generic iPhotography, so the Facebook-owned app began personalizing Explore in 2014, and eventually started showing trends and themed playlists of videos.
Now Explore could give Stories a boost as it competes with its forefather, Snapchat Stories, which Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom told me deserves “all the credit” for pioneering the ephemeral slideshow format. Explore enhances Instagram’s biggest talking point here — that more people already have an interest graph and audience on Instagram than Snapchat.
Instagram refused to give specifics about how its version of Stories is growing, but Barnes did say “We’re really excited to see how quickly they’ve caught on, whether with everyday users or celebrities and brands.”
He recounts how his favorite story yet has been basketball star LeBron James showing himself lonely and eating cereal on a rented yacht. “Stories removed the fear of over-posting or worrying about Likes and comments,” Barnes explains.
After of month of using Instagram and Snapchat Stories, Instagram’s product clearly lags behind. Uploads don’t always get added properly, the lack of colored text is annoying and I miss the selfie lenses and geofilters. Yet I’m getting more of my real friends watching and replying, and the rewind feature makes consumption easy to control.
Snapchat doesn’t seem to be outright losing users to Instagram Stories, but the real threat is that this copycat could be cuddly enough to keep non-Snappers from straying. Barnes concludes, “It has the early signs of being a product people love.”",2016-08-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/explore-instagram-stories.jpg?w=738,instagram-stories,Instagram Stories diverges from Snapchat by suggesting who to follow
609,John Biggs,"In an effort to highlight its upcoming launch of more in-train Wi-Fi (not to be confused with in-train cricket attacks), the New York MTA, Transit Wireless, and publishing powerhouse Penguin Random House are getting together to release ebooks and articles timed to your commute. This project mirrors a product launched in London last year.
As The Digital Reader notes, even Governor Cuomo is in on the fun. “New York’s transportation network must continue adapting to the changing needs of its ridership and a key part of that is delivering the amenities that have become essential components of everyday life,” he said. “Bringing Wi-Fi into underground stations helps riders stay connected throughout their commute, allowing them to check in with friends or family and access news or entertainment. We’ve made tremendous progress in modernizing the system and Subway Reads is a fun way to introduce riders to the new Wi-Fi experience.”‎

610,Sarah Perez,"On Monday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan met with Pope Francis, as part of Zuckerberg’s trip of Italy, announced following the devastating earthquake that hit the country last week, killing hundreds. After discussing the importance of connecting people in the world without internet access, Zuckerberg presented the Pope with a drone – but, alas, not a working one. Instead, it was a model of Facebook’s solar-powered Aquila aircraft, designed to beam internet access to those areas of the world that are lacking connectivity.
The Aquila drone, which has a wingspan of over 113 feet – bigger than a Boeing 737 – just completed its first official test flight this summer. The drone will fly for 90 days at a time, and can blanket a 60-mile wide area with internet access.
According to a post on Zuckerberg’s Facebook page, the CEO told the Pope how much he admired his message of mercy and tenderness, as well as how he’s found new ways to communicate with people of every faith around the world. (The current Pope uses social media, having followed in Benedict’s footsteps by joining Twitter, and he signed up for an Instagram account just this March.)
In a statement released by the Vatican’s press office, the Pope and Zuckerberg discussed how technology can aid in continuing to spread the Pope’s message.

“Together they spoke about how to use communications technology to alleviate poverty, encourage a culture of encounter, and to communicate a message of hope, especially to the most disadvantaged,” said Vatican press office director Greg Burke in a statement.
As part of the trip, Zuckerberg also met with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to discuss the earthquake, the economy, and technology’s impact on job creation, among other things. The CEO hosted a Townhall Q&A in Rome, which was live-streamed on Facebook, as well.
“I told the Prime Minister I’m especially excited with the work being done across Europe on artificial intelligence,” wrote Zuckerberg on Facebook.
“As part of the Facebook AI Research Partnership Program, we’re providing 26 state-of-the-art GPU servers to research institutions across Europe — including one to the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia here in Italy. They’ve got a great artificial intelligence and computer vision program, and this new technology will hopefully help students and the faculty do even more,” he said.
Fifteen research groups across 9 countries in Europe will receive these computers, which are similar to those at FAIR (Facebook AI Research) with 8 high-end GPU cards each. The computers are meant to help recipients in research areas like computer vision, learning systems, deep neural networks, and more.
Beyond getting face time with the Pope, it’s also interesting to see Zuckerberg taking on the role that’s usually reserved for politicians – that is, touring a country after a natural disaster. While that wasn’t the primary purpose of the visit, it’s clear that Facebook has a larger role to play in the world economy these days, and is working to get key players to buy into its plans to bring the internet to the unconnected masses.
Earlier this year, Zuckerberg went to China, where he held a rare meeting with China’s propaganda chief, Liu Yunshan, to discuss internet development in China, and how Facebook could be included. The site has been blocked in the country, which hosts 720+ million internet users, since 2009.",2016-08-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/screen-shot-2016-08-29-at-11-54-47-am.png?w=738,pope-francis,"Mark Zuckerberg meets Pope Francis, gives him a drone"
611,John Mannes,"Microsoft today pushed out in a blog post for users of its consumer services new resources to reduce hate speech. Users will now be able to communicate directly with the company to report hate speech, and petition for reinstating content via new online forms.
Most people are familiar with efforts by social networks like Twitter and Facebook to ensure safety within their respective online communities. Just last week, Twitter announced the suspension of an additional 235,000 accounts for promoting terrorism.
While Microsoft has also been active in preventing terrorist content from propagating on its services, the company has received less attention than its peers. Services like Outlook, Skype, Xbox, OneDrive and Office 365 draw millions of users that are too easily forgotten with the rise of new platforms like Snapchat and Instagram.
And while most interactions on these platforms are positive, even Microsoft is not immune to the distribution of hateful, inappropriate and sometimes illegal content. Microsoft regularly processes European “Right to be Forgotten” requests and filings for the removal of revenge porn, copyrighted content and illegal content.
Tangibly, in addition to prior efforts, Microsoft is launching two new forms, one each for reporting content and restoring content. At this point, Microsoft already moderates content for inappropriate speech and allows users to request review of a content removal decision.
“We will continue our ‘notice-and-takedown’ approach for removing prohibited content on hosted consumer services, and the new form aims to improve the quality and speed of our reviews,” said Jacqueline Beauchere, Microsoft Chief Online Safety Officer, in a blog post about the new forms.

612,Josh Constine,"Twitter’s “Trends” are often confusing. Why is #MPBMS or #TechMunch trending? You had to click through and figure it out for yourself. When Facebook copied Twitter’s trends in 2014, it vastly improved them by adding human-written descriptions right below so you knew if you cared or not.
Today Facebook is removing those descriptions, and claims it’s to increase the scalability and personalization of the product. This is a win for users who don’t browse Facebook in English and might get access to Trending Topics sooner. But it’s a loss for those English-speaking users who could previously much more quickly scan the descriptions of Trends for whether they were worth a click.

Without humans slowing down and driving up the price of the product, everyone will get to see Trending Topics that are even better tailored to your interests based on Pages you Like, your location, Trends you previously interacted with, and more. It will also be able to bring Trending Topics to more languages.
One other explanation is that Facebook is seeking to minimize human interaction with trends. Earlier this year it was accused by Gizmodo’s anonymous sources of suppressing conservative Trends, though an investigation found no evidence to support that. [Update: However, Facebook doesn’t have complete data logs of curation choices from the time period questioned.]
The allegations still riled right wing feathers during an election cycle when Facebook is seeking to seem impartial. Humans will still ensure Trends are about something newsy, not just #Lunch every day.

Sure, if you’ve got some niche interests like an extreme sport, geeky academic pursuit, or B-list celebrity, the new Trending Topics will be able to show you more hashtags about them now. But you won’t be able to tell what the cryptic hashtags are about at a glance anymore. Instead, you’ll need to hover over the trends to see a news story, user post, or an excerpt from the original source about the trend.
The strategy seems like a step backwards. Facebook makes tons of money — over $2 billion in profit last quarter alone. Financing the existing human description writers shouldn’t be that much of a problem. Hiring scribes for a few of the other most popular languages on the planet probably wouldn’t break the bank, either.
Instead, Facebook could have chosen to keep descriptions for major Trending Topics shown to lots of people in English, and just drop them when the algorithms suggest a niche Trend or one for users with unsupported languages.
At 1.71 billion users, Facebook has to do what’s right for the masses. Yet it’s rare to see the company quite clearly degrade the usability of a product a shortcut to scale.",2016-08-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/facebook-trending.png?w=738,,Facebook ditches helpful Trending Topic descriptions for global scale
613,Natasha Lomas,"Well that was fast. Just one day after WhatsApp revealed a sea-change in its attitude to user data, by detailing plans to share the mobile numbers and last seen status of its users with parent company Facebook for ad-targeting and marketing purposes, the UK’s data protection watchdog has fired a warning shot across Zuckerberg’s bows by announcing it intends to investigate the arrangement.
In a statement today, fresh-in-post UK information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who only took up the role last month, said: “We’ve been informed of the changes. Organisations do not need to get prior approval from the ICO to change their approaches, but they do need to stay within data protection laws. We are looking into this.”
Denham said the regulator will be considering whether the two companies are being transparent with users about how their data is being shared and used.
“The changes WhatsApp and Facebook are making will affect a lot of people. Some might consider it’ll give them a better service, others may be concerned by the lack of control. Our role is to pull back the curtain on things like this, ensuring that companies are being transparent with the public about how their personal data is being shared, and protecting consumers by making sure the law is being followed,” she added.
A WhatsApp spokesperson had this to say when asked for comment on the ICO’s interest in its new privacy policy: “We look forward to answering any questions regulators or other stakeholders have about this update.”
Discussing the legal implications of the new data-sharing arrangement between WhatsApp and Facebook with TechCrunch earlier today, Scott Vernick, partner and head of the data security and privacy practice at U.S. law firm Fox Rothschild LLP, suggested regulators will be keen to ensure the language used in the updated T&Cs clearly and accurately conveys the changes being made.
“The question that any regulator will be asking is whether or not the new policies and the way in which you opt into them — or opt out of them — is expressed in clear to the average user,” he said. “There’s no doubt that a disclosure is being made, but it’s a question of whether it’s transparent enough to the average user so you know exactly what it is you’re giving up.”
When WhatsApp users are prompted to agree to the new T&Cs in the app, the wording that describes the purpose of the setting where they can opt out of sharing data with Facebook is as follows: “Share my WhatsApp account information with Facebook to improve my Facebook ads and products experiences. Your chats and phone number will not be shared onto Facebook regardless of this setting.” — Emphasis theirs.
It’s possible that someone reading that wording quickly might think their phone number will not be shared with Facebook. When in fact it will be shared with Facebook the company. (But will just not be publicly posted onto their own Facebook page.) So there certainly looks to be some room for confusion, although it remains to be seen whether the ICO will view the phrasing as troublingly opaque or not.
Vernick also suggested another area that might be problematic for the WhatsApp/Facebook data-sharing arrangement is if the two companies gave certain guarantees to regulators about how they would handle user data at the time of the WhatsApp acquisition — and can now be shown to be reneging on any earlier commitments.
“The regulators have been much more active in looking at the M&A space, and looking at the privacy consequences for M&A activity,” he noted. “And so I could see a scenario in which if either Facebook or WhatsApp or the both of them made certain representations to the regulators, either in the States or in Europe, about what was going to happen with individual user information once the two companies hooked up and now they’re going back on that, then that could be a real issue.”
Potential legal implications aside, Vernick argued there is an unavoidable “visceral” reaction to such a big change by WhatsApp on sharing user data, given how the company has previously positioned itself as a privacy champion — which in itself could have serious trust/reputational consequences if users feel betrayed.
“I think there’s a real visceral issue here which in some ways is more important than the legal issue — not that the legal issues aren’t important, but it’s just this idea that as consumers, or as users, we continue — assuming there’s anything left to lose — we just continue to lose more,” he said.
“It feels like a bit of a bait and switch. Or it feels like I’m losing more control even though my choices are ‘well if you don’t like it, just don’t use it’,” he added.
In terms of ‘choice’, other encrypted messaging apps are of course available. One example, Telegram, offers end-to-end encryption via a secret chats features. Another, Signal, is made by the same company that makes the open source secure-messaging protocol that WhatsApp has rolled out to its own app — completing that rollout earlier this year.
Telegram founder Pavel Durov confirmed to TechCrunch the app has seen a small bump in downloads since the WhatsApp privacy policy change was announced, with an increase of new users in the region of 30 to 40 per cent over the past 24 hours. Although he added that it has not seen “millions” of downloads — as it did when the Facebook-WhatsApp acquisition was announced, back in February 2014.",2016-08-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/facebook-whatsapp-screen.jpg?w=738,privacy,WhatsApp-Facebook data-sharing deal probed by UK privacy watchdog
614,Natasha Lomas,"Facebook-owned messaging giant WhatsApp has announced a big change to its privacy policy which, once a user accepts its new T&Cs, will see it start to share some user data with its parent company — including for ad-targeting purposes on the latter service.
“[B]y coordinating more with Facebook, we’ll be able to do things like track basic metrics about how often people use our services and better fight spam on WhatsApp,” WhatsApp writes in a blog on the change today.
“Facebook can offer better friend suggestions and show you more relevant ads if you have an account with them. For example, you might see an ad from a company you already work with, rather than one from someone you’ve never heard of.”
WhatsApp will also be sharing the data with the “Facebook family of companies” — so presumably its user data could also be fed to VR firm Oculus Rift, another Fb acquisition, and photo-sharing network Instagram.
WhatsApp data that will be shared under the new T&Cs includes the phone number a user used to verify their account, and the last time they used the service.
Two pieces of data which — on a creepiness scale of ‘personal intel you’d rather not hand over to a data-mining tech giant’ — are both right up there.
You can read the full WhatsApp privacy policy here.
There is an option to opt out of some of the data sharing (specifically for ad and product purposes)  — see lower down this post for more details — although most users will just tap ‘I agree’ to WhatsApp’s new T&Cs without reading them and realizing what they are agreeing to.
This is why, as we’ve said before, T&Cs suck. And why user consent to a massive privacy shift like this should certainly not default opt people in.
This is undoubtedly a huge step-change for a service that has typically prided itself on championing user privacy, including completing a rollout of end-to-end encryption across its entire service earlier this year, and continuing to fight requests from authorities to hand over user data.
But once WhatsApp agreed to be acquired by data-mining social network giant Facebook, back in February 2014, the writing was arguably on the wall for any pro-privacy stance.
Facebook is in the business of monetizing usage via interest-based advertising fed by harvesting the personal data of its users. WhatsApp’s original business model, of charging users a small yearly subscription fee for an ad-free messaging service, was discontinued after Facebook took over ownership of the service.
The annual $1 fee was ditched in January this year, but WhatsApp still does not have a replacement business model — given its anti-ads stance, although it is laying the groundwork to open up business accounts. And the intel it will be sharing with Facebook under its new T&Cs will likely be used to further its plans there.
At the time of the acquisition Facebook said it would be keeping the messaging giant independent, despite some obvious overlap with its own Facebook Messenger app.
While WhatsApp founder Jan Koum claimed there would be no changes. “Here’s what will change for you, our users: nothing. WhatsApp will remain autonomous and operate independently,” he wrote at the time, adding: “There would have been no partnership between our two companies if we had to compromise on the core principles that will always define our company, our vision and our product.”
Fast forward a couple of years and one core principle — privacy — is now being, if not entirely compromised, at least loosened — given that Facebook will now be able to link users of its own social services with WhatsApp users. It will also be able to track relative usage of its services vs activity on the messaging app, as WhatsApp feeds it engagement intel via the ‘last used’ signal.
It’s not clear from the WhatsApp blog post if other user data will be shared with Facebook. The wording suggests this is entirely possible, although if a user has updated to the latest version of the app, which end-to-end encrypts all content, then their messaging content at least cannot be shared, so long as the person they are messaging has also updated.
WhatsApp also makes this point in its blog post, noting: “When your messages are end-to-end encrypted, only the people you are messaging with can read them — not WhatsApp, Facebook, or anyone else.”
But that’s kind of missing the point about letting Facebook triangulate users across two massive services, with over a billion active users apiece. It remains to be seen whether that collapsing of boundaries between two distinct services will catch the attention of data protection regulators in Europe, which has more stringent privacy rules, and where Facebook has already faced multiple data protection related investigations and legal actions — and continues to do so.
We’ve asked WhatsApp for a comprehensive list of everything it intends to share with Facebook, and for a comprehensive list of everything Facebook intends to do with the data it will be receiving on WhatsApp users and their usage of the service — and will update this post with any response.
As well as phone number and last seen data, TechCrunch understands Facebook will also be fed intel on a WhatApp user’s operating system, mobile country code, mobile carrier code, screen resolution and device identifier. All of which open up plentiful tracking/ad-targeting possibilities.
But this looks very much like Facebook trying to ‘fill in’ missing mobile phone number data via the more comprehensive WhatsApp address book — given that the latter requires users to supply a number to verify an account, whereas it is possible to use Facebook without supplying your mobile number (albeit, Facebook might well have grabbed your digits via your friends uploading their contacts’ books to the service anyway… And the service periodically nags those who haven’t to add a mobile number…).

WhatsApp says the data is being shared to “coordinate more and improve experiences across our services and those of Facebook and the Facebook family” — going on to cite the following three specific examples:
In WhatsApp’s privacy policy it fleshes this out a little more, including noting potential marketing and ad-targeting use-cases for sharing its user data with Facebook — writing (emphasis mine):
One such marketing use-case for Facebook to make use of the WhatsApp phone number data is for its Custom Audiences ad offering, whereby businesses using its platform can target ads based on an existing customer contact list they have.
So any WhatsApp users that have given a business the same mobile phone number they use for the app can be served targeted ads by that same business via Facebook.
While a Facebook product use-case for the phone number data is to expand the friend recommendations it can send — by it being able to identify more networks of friends, based on linking more people to mobile numbers.
Opting out of the data-sharing entirely does not seem to be possible, but WhatsApp is offering a partial opt out — specifically for Facebook ad targeting and product-related purposes.
However it notes that data will still be shared “for other purposes such as improving infrastructure and delivery systems, understanding how our services or theirs are used, securing systems, and fighting spam, abuse, or infringement activities”.
So there is no way to totally opt out, short of short of stopping using WhatsApp.
A WhatsApp spokesperson declined to comment on why it is not offering users a complete opt out of data-sharing with Facebook, but in a statement the spokesperson said: “We understand people with WhatsApp accounts might want to opt out of sharing their account information to improve their Facebook experiences. They have an additional 30 days to opt out after accepting the new terms so they have time to consider their choices.”
WhatsApp details two ways to opt out of sharing data for Facebook ad targeting on its blog here.
Firstly if you haven’t already agreed to the new T&Cs you can opt out before agreeing to the new terms by tapping to read the full terms of service and privacy policy — and scrolling to a control at the bottom of the document — where there’s a check-box option for sharing the data which you then untick before hitting agree…
If you’ve already accepted the new T&Cs without unchecking the box to share your information with Facebook WhatsApp is also offering a thirty-day window to make the same choice — via the settings page in the app.
To exercise your opt out in this scenario you need to go to Settings > Account > Share my account info in the app and uncheck the box/toggle the control displayed there. And do so within the thirty-day window. Presumably, after that, even this partial opt out will expire.

615,Jordan Crook,"After a failed attempt to go social with Ping in 2010, Apple may have a renewed sense of excitement over the social space, according to a report from Bloomberg.
Sources told Bloomberg that Apple is working on a video recording/editing app that would be similar in functionality to Snapchat, though there’s no mention of disappearing or self-destructing content in the report. Instead, the app is supposed to be easy to use with one hand for video recording, and users will be able to swipe between various filters or add drawings.
The main goal is that users will be able to create and edit videos within a minute.
One of the filters is said to be an Instagram-sized square, instead of the native rectangle on the iPhone, though Apple’s camera software already has that functionality built in. So…?
The ultimate hope is that people would use the app, which is being built by the same folks who built iMovie and Final Cut Pro, to create the content to share with other social networks.
Bloomberg reports that Apple is not clear-cut on when (or even if) this app will launch, or whether or not it will live as part of iOS or as its own standalone app.
For the first time in a long time, Apple’s iPhone isn’t shattering sales expectations quarter after quarter, so an enhanced focus on services business makes sense. However, you’d expect Apple to double down on existing, and potentially quite lucrative, businesses like Apple Pay, Music, and iTunes rather than diving into social, where so much land has already been claimed in the name of Facebook and Snapchat.
Then again, this report could be about a content creation app that complements social networks, as opposed to being its own full-fledged social network like the now-deceased Google Plus.
Or… this report could be about nothing. Apple is highly secretive, and it wouldn’t be the first time someone floated a rumor that never came to be.

616,Jon Russell,"Here’s a fresh example to show that Twitter, a ten-year-old company that has been public for the last three, retains the propensity to act like a newborn when it comes to its 310 million active users.
We know Twitter struggles to handle the unsavory elements that exist on its platform — the recent harassment of Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones showed that in clear terms — but once in a while the company goes ahead and does things itself that just seem to run counter to its ‘free speech’ values.
This week, Twitter booted a sports journalist from its platform because he tweeted three GIFs from the Olympics Games in Brazil.
That’s right, it banned him entirely rather than simply removing the offending content.
His account has since been reinstated following publicity, but the example is worrying.
Twitter, like all social networks, has a responsibility to police its platform for unlicensed content and remove what it uncovers. That’s been heightened around the Olympics after the International Olympics Committee (IOC) instituted some predictably conservative regulations ahead of the games this month which included, among other things, a ban on GIFs, short video clips and live-streaming of sporting action.
Twitter typically deals with unlicensed content by removing it from its service, so suspending a user seems overly punitive and, if not a mistake, perhaps even an effort to make an example.
Jim Weber, the user in question, explained in a LinkedIn post that he received emails from both Twitter and the IOC about his tweets but, despite trying to comply, got banned.
The organizations first demanded a removal of the content — the IOC gave a 10 minute window to do so — but within just a few minutes of Twitter’s first email, Weber’s account was temporarily suspended. The next morning, things escalated further as Twitter informed Weber that his account had been “permanently suspended for violating Twitter’s copyright policy.”
The frustrating thing appears to be that Twitter didn’t acknowledge Weber’s efforts to remedy the situation.
Weber, who started Lostlettermen.com and later sold it to Vaynermedia, said he had “probably written Twitter Support 10 times asking how long the suspension will last and if there is anything I could do to have it lifted” before the final email and ban. He admitted he thought the GIF tweets — which he pulled from Reddit — might get deleted, but he never envisaged losing his account altogether.
The account has close to 100,000 followers, and a potential large audience for the GIFs might explain why Twitter and the IOC acted in a somewhat frenzied fashion. Nonetheless, the way his case was dealt with seems very poor.
Weber has sent more than 69,000 tweets to date and built a large following on the service, yet that work was all removed via a heavy-handed process with zero human interaction.
Twitter appeared to have restored Weber’s account after his story went viral — a number of concerned users had tagged Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to alert him to the case, not unlike what happened with the bullying of Jones.
The fact that this particular incident involves the IOC has led many to suggest that Twitter is prioritizing the demands of a content partner above its userbase — which we know isn’t growing at the rate that the company hopes.
“It’s disappointing that Twitter will throw users under the bus to do it by permanently banning the very users that built Twitter into the vibrant community it is today. It’s even more frustrating that I didn’t have a single human interaction but was delivered form letters determining my fate — likely sent from somewhere halfway around the world,” New York-based Weber wrote on LinkedIn.
He added that he is now “hesitant to post anything to social media platforms” such was his experience.
His account may have been reinstated, but for Weber and many others, we have yet another piece of anecdotal evidence outlining problems that continue to remain broken even after a decade of Twitter.
Twitter declined to comment when we asked for further information. The company did, however, point us to its copyright policy, which includes instructions on how to file a counter notice.",2016-08-25,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/twitter-olympics.png?w=738,,Olympic GIF ban flip-flop shows once again that Twitter can’t manage its users
617,Sarah Perez,"Twitter today continues to push forward with its increased emphasis on its messaging feature, with the rollout of a new button for websites that allows visitors to privately message an individual or company directly. The feature, now one of several website buttons available, follows the company’s recent test of a change to brands’ customer support profiles’ that encouraged users to direct message, not tweet, at the business’s Twitter account.
In that case, a new “Message” button appeared on the profile on mobile – taking over the full space where “Tweet to” and “Message” used to live side-by-side. Early testers included big names like Apple, Uber, Beats, Activision, and others.
Today’s update, meanwhile, is about making it easier to message a business from the web.
The company already offered buttons for following, sharing, mentioning, and hashtags, but not DM’s. So, to some extent, this is just about Twitter rounding out its product offerings to be more comprehensive.
However, the button’s arrival comes at a time when Facebook has been moving to make its chat app Messenger the default way that consumers interact with businesses.
The social network recently redesigned its business Pages, which puts a “Message” button at the top of the page, assuming the business in question uses chat. And earlier this year, it announced a suite of tools that made it easier for businesses to connect with customers on Messenger, including things like Messenger links and scannable Messenger codes for initiating chats, business usernames based on Page names, and Messenger greetings.
Twitter, meanwhile, has become known better as a place where consumers go to complain when things go wrong – often posting angry tweets, with the brand’s @username attached. By shipping more tools that let customers take that sentiment to a private chat, businesses could then continue to use Twitter as part of their marketing, consumer outreach, and support strategies, instead of shifting all their communications to Facebook.
Shortly after Twitter’s announcement of the new button this afternoon, a few early testers reported they were getting error messages when they tried to use it. Apparently, the new button isn’t quite ready just yet, but should be functional in the near future.
UPDATE: The feature is functional, the customer above didn’t fill out the form correctly.",2016-08-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/shutterstock_294503453.jpg?w=738,,Twitter’s new button lets you accept private messages from your website
618,Sarah Perez,"The joy that comes from listening to music with friends is something that’s been around ever since…well, ever since music. But today, thanks to digital services that let you listen anytime, anywhere, music is now more often a solo experience. A new app called Lisn wants to change that, by offering you a way to listen to music with a friend, no matter how far apart you are, and chat about it right in the app.
“It’s like sharing earphones,” the startup’s website proclaims – and indeed, it does seem like the modern-day version of handing one of your earbuds to a friend.
The app allows you to stream and share tracks via SoundCloud and Spotify (either full tracks via Spotify Premium, or 30-second previews). These songs are then synced in real-time when your friend tunes in to listen along with you.

The idea is that this offers a more interactive, engaging way to discover new music. Not only is there a personal recommendation involved, the co-listening experience is meant to be more fun than having a friend simply share a link to a song over a messaging app.
That being said, Lisn supports the ability to forward songs through other apps, too. And it offers a way for you to listen to shared music even when your friend is not online. That is, you can tap the push notification or head into the app to listen to the recommended track whenever you choose. In this case, the sender will receive an alert that you’re streaming their shared track, and they can pop into the app and join you, if they’re available.
When you find a song you like, you can save it to your Spotify or SoundCloud library for later streaming. In total, there are over 130 million tracks that can be shared then saved from Lisn.
The idea for the app arose from a hackathon project back in October 2015, says Lisn co-founder and user interface designer Abhinav Chhikara.

 
He and two other co-founders, Vibhas Jain and Abheyraj Singh, previously met while at Housing.com where they worked on the company’s mobile team. Jain was also the lead designer at PayTM, India’s most used digital wallet, before joining Lisn. And Singh, notably, worked on Airtel’s Wynk Music – one of India’s most popular streaming apps. A fourth co-founder, Bhargav Sosale, was a school friend whose background includes startup experience in Singapore.
Following the hackathon, the founders begin to work on the app full-time. During its beta, Chhikara says they found Lisn was used more heavily by younger people. But it appealed to others as well, he claims.
“To give you an example of how people have been using it, we’ve got couples in long distance relationships using the music-plus-chat experience to communicate. Friends from university who’ve now moved to different cities are using it to stay in touch and exchange tracks,” he explains.  “Music producers using it to send music to their team and other collaborators, listening to it together and talking about certain parts of the song as it plays,” Chhikara adds.
The app launched earlier this month, and recently hit #2 on Product Hunt.
Now that the app is live, the team is working on bringing Lisn to Android, as well as adding features like group chat, queueing, playlists in search,  and more. The app will also include support for more music services in time, with Apple Music at the top of the ‘to-do’ list (assuming they can get API access.)
For now, Chhikara says Lisn is focused on growth, not monetization – that means the app is a free download, ad-free, and doesn’t require any subscription to use.
The idea for social music listening, of course, has been tried before. For example, Turntable.fm was a hot site back in the day – so hot, in fact, Facebook even tried to copy it for a time. However, Turntable.fm failed to gain sustainable traction. However, Turntable.fm didn’t launch in the mobile-first era, and it was more about DJ-led sessions, not friend-to-friend recommendations as in Lisn.

619,Matthew Lynley,"Pinterest said today that it would be acquiring the team behind Instapaper, which will continue operating as a separate app. The Instapaper team will both work on the core Pinterest experience and updating Instapaper.
Pinterest’s logic here is that one of the company’s core tenets is bookmarking — much like Instapaper’s primary goal with its app. The company has been on an aggressive acquisition binge in the past few months. In July, Pinterest acquihired the team behind Highlight and Shorts. It would seem that much like other apps that remain very popular in certain niches, Pinterest is going to let this one continue running (at least, until it ends up running its course).

Instapaper was one of the original “save it for later” readers that built up a mentality around being able to hold onto longer forms of content without simply skipping over it and missing it. It became an early popular application on the iPhone, holding high rankings in the App Store in the news category (and at times, the entire app store). But there’s been a lot of increasing competition from other companies like Pocket, making it tricky.

So, in all, it shouldn’t seem like that abrupt an end to Instapaper. Creator Marco Arment passed the torch when Betaworks acquired the app in 2013. The following year it transitioned to more of a freemium model from its original paid product. The reality is apps that introduce a core functionality or use case are eventually subsumed by the very platforms where that core functionality works best.
Naturally, the talent and technology behind such a core functionality would be valuable to a company like Pinterest. The “save” part of Pinterest’s mantra (“discover, save, do”) is meant to be taken quite literally — collecting ideas and logging them for future action on various pin boards. Having those ideas logged gives users a reason to regularly come back to the site to accomplish things they were complementing at the time, but decided against acting upon.
One of the natural implications of having a better experience around saving content on Pinterest is giving the company ways to convert users in forms that potentially don’t exist yet. The obvious one today is purchasing products, in which Pinterest has tools to do that directly in the site. But the core use cases for Pinterest are increasingly expanding, with one recent addition being native video (and the ability to advertise against that native vide).
Here’s an example: when Pinterest started rolling out native video ads, ads product manager Mike Bidgoli told me one of the big user behaviors the company observed was users quickly skimming videos rather than watching them in full. Saving those videos for a more complete viewing experience seems like an obvious user experience Pinterest would want to perfect, because it means higher engagement — and a higher likelihood of potentially converting a user to get to that “do” point in the chain of actions Pinterest hopes to encourage.
All this is important for Pinterest for two reasons: the more talent in general it attracts, the more it can tweak and improve its products; And the more specialized teams they can bring in, the better they can re-imagine what the existing functionalities might look like as user behavior whiplashes from device and behavior to new expectations.
And of course, the general line of business logic still applies here: higher return rate, higher engagement, higher chance of conversion or advertising opportunity leading to more revenue and more room to continue growing. If we’re seeing Pinterest get more acquisitive, it’s likely in an effort to figure out how to bring together existing products with new ideas in order to figure out what the next version of that experience (in this case, “save”) looks like over the next few years.",2016-08-23,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/pinterest-save-button.jpg?w=738,"instapaper,pinterest","Pinterest acquires Instapaper, which will live on as a separate app"
620,Sarah Perez,"Facebook today is rolling out a number of improvements to its “Slideshow” ads, announced last fall as a means of offering an alternative to video ads in developing markets where bandwidth may be limited. The company this morning says that advertisers will now be able to create these ads right from their phones, as well as take advantage of new features like the ability to add text and music, as well as more photos, including Facebook’s own stock image library.
As a refresher, Slideshow ads launched in October with the goal of offering a video-like ad experience to markets where videos would be slow to load. The format allowed for three to seven photos that would automatically play, lasting five to fifteen seconds. The benefit of Slideshows over video is that the file size could be up to 5 times smaller than a video of the same length. That means they’ll start playing a lot quicker.
At the time of the launch, Slideshows didn’t include sound, however.
That’s changing today as Facebook is now allowing Slideshow ads to offer a richer experience. This includes the ability to add text, select templates and choose colors, as well as pick from a range of audio tracks. Facebook says that, soon, advertisers will also be able to upload their own music files, too. And it’s better integrating Slideshows with Facebook’s stock image database and the Pages Photo Library feature, which makes it easier to source images from thousands of stock photos or reuse those from the business’s Page.
Although introducing support for audio may seem like an odd change for an ad format aimed at those with slow connections, Facebook explains that Slideshows have caught on with those outside of emerging markets, too, because the ads are more cost-effective to produce than video.
As they’re simply a stringing together of photos, they can be built in minutes.

In addition, it says that many advertisers – including those in areas where network connection speed is not a concern – have wanted to use the format by converting their existing video to a Slideshow. Before, they were doing this manually, which takes time. Today, Facebook is rolling out a new tool that will allow them to quickly turn video into Slideshows by automatically pulling out 10 still images from the video to use in the ad’s creation.
The increase to 10 photos is also a change from before, when only a max of 7 was supported.
Finally, Facebook is making ad creation more accessible by allowing advertisers to create the ads from their mobile devices, beginning with Android.
The ads can also be targeted toward users with 2G connections, Facebook notes, for those who do want to reach emerging markets.
The company mentioned that one customer using Slideshow ads, a sock company called Stance, saw their cost per acquisition decreased by 48% compared with photo link ads, the click-through rate increased 2.42 times, and their return on ad spend increased by 1.48 times. Unilever is also using Slideshow ads in Indonesia, Facebook said in a blog post announcing the new features. Early adopters, meanwhile, had included Coca-Cola and Netflix.
The new features are live today globally.",2016-08-23,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/screen-shot-2016-08-23-at-11-15-04-am.png?w=738,ads,"Facebook improves its “lightweight video” Slideshow ads, including support for mobile ad creation"
621,Steve O'Hear,"Entrepreneur First, the company builder program for technical graduates, has just kicked off its sixth cohort’s Demo Day at Facebook’s London-based UK HQ where 21 newly formed startups are about to pitch on stage. But as is now tradition, EF is also taking the opportunity to make an announcement of its own.
The so-called “talent-first” investor, which puts technical graduates through a six-month program where they form teams and in turn found startups, has closed a new £40 million fund to co-invest in graduating companies. This will span participation in any subsequent seed and Series A rounds.
The additional financial resources will also be used to extend the operational support it can provide startups to 18 months after graduation, and for a further £70,000 investment per graduating startup in the form of a loan note to bridge the gap between Demo Day and a more formal funding round.
In a call with EF co-founder Matt Clifford yesterday, he told me that the largest LP in the new fund, dubbed “Next Stage Fund”, is the UK taxpayer-funded British Business Bank, which has made a £26 million investment.
Others participating include Imperial College, Sir Charles Dunstone’s Freston Ventures, and Isomer Capital, which is also an investor in other UK VCs, including Hoxton Ventures, White Star Capital, Felix Capital, and Connect Ventures. A number of individual entrepreneurs and family offices/funds are also LPs.
The fact that Imperial College is an LP in the new fund is also particularly noteworthy and, says Clifford, somewhat of a coup. EF is in effect competing for ‘talent flow’ — my words, not his — rather than deal flow for its company builder program. That’s in reference to the fact that EF seeks to attract the best technical talent, often straight out of university.
When pressed, Clifford counts competitors as academia and “deep tech” companies, such as Google’s DeepMind, who are also working very hard to attract the brightest technical minds, rather than traditional accelerators or incubators.
Meanwhile, Clifford says that EF’s new investment vehicle will never take the lead on a seed or A round as it doesn’t want to over signal to the market or be seen as picking favourites from any of its cohorts. The £40 million will be spread across cohort 6 to cohort 10 taking place in September 2018. It should see over 100 companies receive further financial backing from EF over that period.
I’m told that General Partners Joe White and Wendy Tan White (founders of Moonfruit) will manage EF’s new fund alongside Clifford and EF’s other co-founder Alice Bentinck.
(I also understand that the White’s were instrumental in its closing, having previously laid some of the ground work when they were still considering doing a fund of their own and before they teamed up with EF).
And those of you following closely will already know that EF has been busy building out its own investor network, including in the U.S., as it readies itself to close the European funding gap and prove to early naysayers that it can back the right pony more than once.",2016-09-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/ef-general-partners.jpg?w=738,entrepreneur-first,Entrepreneur First closes £40M fund to co-invest in alumni companies
622,Romain Dillet,"French startup Lydia is launching a card so that you can spend your Lydia balance in every retailer that accepts MasterCard. You can trigger a lot of features in the app. In other words, you remain in control of your card, and not your bank.
Lydia started off as a peer-to-peer payment app so that you can pay back your friends using your phone — gone are the tedious IBAN and wire transfers. There are now 500,000 Lydia users in France.
While sending money takes just a few seconds as Lydia relies on your bank’s credit card to charge you, it can take a couple of days before your recipient actually gets the money in their bank account. Like many other payment apps, Lydia relies on SEPA transfers when you withdraw money from your Lydia wallet.
But this is about to change as Lydia is making withdrawal instantaneous as well thanks to a good old plastic card. Users can request a card for €10 ($11.15), and then they’ll have to pay €3.99 per month ($4.45) — if you use this link, you won’t pay for the initial €10 fee. This card is optional, existing Lydia users can still withdraw money to their bank account for free.
“A card is just a piece of plastic, it’s only a way to authenticate you,” co-founder and CEO Cyril Chiche told me. “And now, we’re realizing that the tech infrastructure behind it matters more than the card itself.”
That’s why Lydia’s card is more flexible than traditional credit cards. Users can activate or deactivate features from the Lydia app. For instance, you could disable NFC payments, ATM withdrawals, foreign payments, etc. Or you could set the payment limit to €50 if you only want to pay for small things with your Lydia card. Or you could disable your card altogether if you can’t find it, and enable it again.
You can trigger these features as many times as you want, and there’s no delay. Similarly, transactions appear instantly in the Lydia app. The reason why Lydia can do this is because the Lydia card checks and updates the MasterCard network every time you try to pay with your card.
When it comes to obscure fees, there’s no overdraft and you can pay everywhere around the world without any additional fee. Lydia doesn’t try to trick you with conversion fees, it uses the standard MasterCard conversion rates.
The company has partnered with a French financial institution to issue these cards. Lydia controls the experience and branding.
In many ways, the Lydia card has the same feature as the N26 card. The main difference is that you don’t have to open a new bank account to use the Lydia card. I feel like only hardcore Lydia users are going to use this card for now. But as Lydia adds more features, the card could become an important part of the product.",2016-09-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/phone_card_everywhere.jpg?w=738,"mastercard,france-newsletter,payment,lydia",Lydia launches a good old plastic card to go beyond the peer-to-peer payment space
623,Steve O'Hear,"The UK’s Divido is one of a number of startups and tech companies operating in the point of sale consumer finance sector. Its alternative payment option lets customers spread the cost of any purchase over a period of time while the retailer gets paid in full right away.
Today the London-based company is disclosing £2.5 million in seed funding led by Mangrove Capital, and DN Capital. The round is actually being billed as the second tranche of the London-based company’s seed funding. It follows a £200,000 grant awarded by the UK government’s innovation agency Innovate UK to support Divido’s mission to bring transparency and competition to traditional point of sale consumer finance.
That’s in reference to way that Divido operates a point of same consumer finance marketplace in the background. When consumers choose Divido as a payment option at checkout they are effectively asked to apply for financing to enable them to delay payment or split payments over a period of time, up to 5 years for higher priced items.
However, unlike competitors, such as Klarna, the company isn’t providing financing themselves but instead connects to its own marketplace of lenders who compete to offer the most suitable credit, including Divido’s most popular 0% finance option.
This line of credit can be applied for via a retailer’s website or, since Divido is omni-channel, in store or over the telephone, which is another key differentiator, Divido founder and CEO Christer Holloman told me during a call.
The marketplace element also differs from the traditional point of sale consumer finance model that typically sees large retailers partner with a single lender in order to be able to offer consumer credit at checkout and, in turn, makes it harder for smaller retailers to compete.
By operating a marketplace of point of sale lenders, in a seamless way and as a single payment option, Holloman says Divido is levelling the playing field somewhat, or, in Silicon Valley-speak, democratising the space. It also explains the startup’s modest funding; since it isn’t providing liquidity — that’s left to its partner lenders — all investment is being spent on operations, such product development and marketing.
And, in case you’re wondering, Divido makes money by receiving a kickback from retailers for each sale they make when the startup’s payment option is invoked and credit is provided.",2016-09-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/5dm38867-1.jpg?w=700,,Divido raises £2.5M to let you spread cost of purchases while retailers get paid immediately
624,Steve O'Hear,"
Founded in July 2014, VizEat has built a platform — or marketplace — that connects those seeking an authentic local dining experience with hosts who are willing to cook for and invite strangers into their homes. In a sense it’s similar to the early days of Airbnb in that the social aspect is part of the draw. A cultural exchange, if you will.
That, Jean-Michel Petit, co-founder and CEO of VizEat, tells me is seeing the platform being used not only by tourists who want to sample local life and food, but also local residents in multicultural cities who have begun taking to VizEat’s “immersive food experience”.
Most of the startup’s 20 staff are located in Paris, but VizEat also has offices in Spain and Italy. It says the new funding will be used to accelerate growth, including opening local offices and recruiting country managers in the U.K. and Germany.
VizEat is also trumpeting a recent hire: former Head of Mobile Acquisition Marketing of Meetic-Match Group Europe, Pierrine Griffiths, has joined the company’s management team.
But how big is collaborative gastronomy, I didn’t actually hear you ask. VizEat says it has grown from 50 hosts to more than 20,000 across 110 countries. Its authentic dining experience now also includes cooking classes and food tours with locals.
However, Petit is candid enough to concede that VizEat has potentially benefited from “last mover advantage” and that for others, such as Cookening, a French early pioneer in the space that VizEat acquired last year, the timing probably wasn’t quite right. He believes that VizEat’s model taps into a behavioural shift that is seeing travellers seek bespoke experiences and are moving away from off-the-shelf and all-inclusive holidays.
Another aspect to VizEat’s early signs of success is that the startup is playing nice and partnering with the travel industry, including marketing the service to business travellers not just tourists. This helps to counterbalance the seasonality of tourism, ensuring that hosts can continue inviting guests to their dinner table throughout the entire year.
In a statement, Petit adds: “For many holidaymakers, a VizEat food experience with locals is often the highlight of any trip. Because travellers don’t have to radically change their travel habits to enjoy these great experiences, VizEat has partnered with a range of hospitality providers, harmoniously aligning itself with the tourism industry. This new round of funding will allow us to boost our growth plans so that we can bring our ultimate local food experiences to more people, in even more countries.”",2016-09-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/copie-de-crecc81dit-carole-sertillanges.jpg?w=738,,"VizEat, a startup that lets you dine in a local’s own home, gobbles up €3.8M funding"
625,Mike Butcher,"The $6.7 billion telepresence and video communication category hasn’t evolved much since we were introduced to Cisco and Polycom. At the same time Smart TVs are making video conferencing easier. But it’s still not that easy.
Hello is a new startup addressing this space — created by two former refugees from the war in Kosovo — which has now passed it’s Kickstarter campaign by over 1,000 per cent. The primary competitors in the professional are Polycom, Cisco, and Lifesize. But the price for one Hello device will be $199 which is a lot cheaper than the industry average of $5,000+. Kickstarter users will get free unlimited use of Hello services for life.
Today we only have two options if we want to do some kind of video interaction with our TVs as consumers or professionals. Buy an expensive Smart TV with apps built-in and a camera. Or, at the high-end, spend a small fortune on a Cisco or Polycom video conferencing system which usually means losing the first 15 productive minutes of every meeting wrestling.
The Hello device is designed to be affordable for businesses and individuals. It requires only two cables – HDMI and power – and then turns any TV into a voice-controlled cross-platform communication device, with wireless screen sharing, live broadcasting, and motion-activated security surveillance features.
But it’s not a typical webcam, it is a voice-controlled device that you can use to talk with friends, family, and colleagues on a video chat service, monitor your kids or pets at home, interact with your business partners or your team, and share your phone or tablet screen without extra cables. It will also act as a security camera in a home as it will send you notifications to any device when it detects unusual activity.
Hello has a 4k video sensor, an array of 4 smart microphones, a 130° field of vision, built-in accelerometer, and a tilting lens, so everyone in the room is seen and heard. The platform will now work on Skype, Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, and Cisco WebEx.
Users can wirelessly share the screen of any computer or mobile device on any Hello-equipped TV, stream live events using the Solaborate platform, and keep an eye on homes and offices while away with HELLO’s motion detection and notification system. The device is cross-platform, working with Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and Linux. While other devices work with Miracast, Chromecast or Airplay exclusively, Hello supports wireless sharing across any device or platform.
And unlike these competitors, Hello offers live broadcasting and security camera features, doesn’t require any training to install and use, has Airplay+ChromeCast+Miracast for wireless screen sharing across any platform or device, and voice control is an intuitive way to command Hello, something you won’t find on others.
They will be charging for the purchase of the hardware device, but to supplement this revenue, Hello services will be subscription based, giving users the choice of a monthly or yearly subscription – exact subscription fees are currently being determined.
The founders are siblings Labinot and Mimoza Bytyqi who fled the war in Kosovo in 1999, arriving as refugees on the West Coast of the US. Labinot worked with SAP for seven years, before launching his first business – CoreALM. The siblings launched Solaborate together in 2012.",2016-09-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/hello21.jpg?w=680,solaborate,"Blowing up on Kickstarter, Hello brings video conferencing and security to any TV"
626,Ingrid Lunden,"One of the biggest tech deals this year — and the biggest ever in the UK — has now closed. Today, Softbank announced that it has completed its acquisition of ARM Holdings, the semiconductor firm that it said in July it would acquire for £24 billion in cash (around $32 billion in today’s currency, $31 billion at the time of the deal), in order to make a big jump into IoT. As a result, ARM will be delisted from the LSE effective September 6. Softbank has said that it plans to run the company as a standalone business.
The news comes a couple of days after the deal received its final required regulatory clearance, paving the way for the close.
“Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition, SBG purchased all of ARM’s issued and to be issued shares (excluding any ARM shares already owned by SBG or an SBG subsidiary) for cash, for a total acquisition price amounting to approximately GBP 24.0 billion (approximately USD 31.0 billion or JPY 3.3 trillion),” the company noted in its announcement. “Subsequent to the completion of the Acquisition, ARM will be delisted from the London Stock Exchange as of September 6, 2016 (GMT) and will cease to be a listed company.”
Softbank will announce the financial and operational impact of the consolidation once it is verified, it said. The companies will start to consolidate their financials as of today.
As we reported at the time the deal was announced, the acquisition of ARM is a big play by Softbank to jump into Internet of Things technology, a sizeable pivot for a company that has made its name more recently around mobile and fixed internet services for consumers, and large investments in outsized- and fast-growing tech companies.
Masayoshi Son, Softbank’s CEO and founder, earlier this year surprised the industry when he announced that he would not retire as he had previously planned, and the acquisition — which he said took took only two weeks to initiate and close — is, in a sense, a mark of how he plans to run things in this next phase of the company’s life.
It’s in contrast to a different spin on the deal, where some believed that Softbank opportunistically swooped in on ARM because of the decline of the pound in the wake of the Brexit vote. That referendum, where the majority of voters in Britain said they wanted the UK to leave the European Union, caused a huge reverberation in the UK economy, and a drop in the value of the British pound.
“Brexit did not affect my decision,” Masayoshi Son said in a press conference the day the deal was announced. “Many people many are worried about Brexit and concerned about he complex situation of the country, but good or bad… I did not make the investment because of Brexit.”
He added that although the price of the pound declined by about 16% in the two weeks that Softbank and ARM negotiated, but ARM’s share price went up by about the same amount, meaning they cancelled each other out. There were other financial factors in play as well: in the weeks leading up to the deal, Softbank sold a chunk of its Alibaba stake and its stake in Supercell, and today it announced a large loan for some $9 billion (¥1 trillion). “This is not opportunistic about the currency,” he joked. “I have wanted to do this but was waiting for the cash to come in.
“I’m not investing in a distressed asset,” he continued. “I’m investing in a paradigm shift…. that’s my passion, and that’s my view.”
If Softbank was in the thick of it at the “beginning of the PC internet,” in Masayoshi’s words (he invested in via Yahoo when it only had 16 employees), and then doubled down on mobile (by way of Softbank’s investments in various mobile companies and acquisition of Sprint) then — he believes — IoT is the natural progression of that.
For ARM, the company has been been one of the UK’s biggest tech success stories. Its growth coincided with the rise of smartphones and its chip reference designs are used by the likes of Apple and many others.
That smartphone business is still there — just last month, longtime chip rival Intel, interestingly, announced it would license ARM’s technology for smartphone chips, in hopes of boosting its own smartphone chipmaking business (in this case to grow business with third-party smartphone chipmakers).
But more importantly, ARM has been shifting its own business to IoT for several years now, in anticipation of a time when growth of its bread-and-butter business might slow down.
(And indeed, that is exactly what’s happening: growth of smartphone sales is now essentially flat as penetration has reached saturation in many markets, and people are waiting longer to replace the phones they already have.)
While there are definitely a lot of products out there now that are “connected” — that is, many ordinary “dumb” objects like refrigerators, locks and lights can now be controlled wirelessly by way of internet connections — the bigger market for IoT products and services is really only just at its start. ARM — and now Softbank — hope that by getting into the game early, they can dominate much as ARM has done in smartphones.",2016-09-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/iotglobe.jpg?w=738,"iot,softbank,arm-holdings",Softbank has completed its £24B cash acquisition of ARM Holdings

As biotechnology gains prominence among investors, two hubs have emerged as hotbeds of innovation for the resurgent industry.
While the two-square-mile patch of South San Francisco bustles with more than 70 biotech firms, including Genentech, Amgen and Exelixis, an equally influential geography has grown along the Lemanic Arc of Switzerland and into the heart of Basel, where pharma giants like Novartis, Actelion and Roche (which acquired Genentech in 2009) have their headquarters.

“Silicon Valley has a very strong life science sector that is enriched by the undeniable strength of the Valley in IT,” said Patrick Aebischer, president of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). “In Switzerland, the Health Valley is trying to take advantage of our unique position in micro/nanotechnology coming from a long tradition of watchmaking.”
California indeed has a very strong culture of IT stemming from Intel’s first programmable computer chip in the late 1960s. Biotechs are therefore reaping the benefits and merging science with the power of IT (i.e. bioinformatics, digital therapeutics, cloud biology and computational medicine).
Twist Bioscience and its storage of data in synthetic DNA is a good example. Koniku has also followed this trend, specializing in neuro-computing by building co-processors made of biological neurons that work alongside traditional silicon processors.
Beyond its talented horologists, Switzerland is also known for its expertise in technical engineering, which has had a considerable impact on the scientific application of micro/nanotechnology. Be it implants or nanomolecules, the country is known for its precision.
Xsensio illustrates this with its Lab-on-Skin nanowearable devices that exploit biochemical information on the skin’s surface. In terms of microtechnology, QGel designs customized in vitro cellular microenvironments for cancer drug screening.
In terms of academic influence and support, both valleys have their fair share. Stanford and UCSF have spun out many success stories in the field of biotechnology, a phenomenon that the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) and Zurich (ETHZ) were quick to follow.
But even though Switzerland’s biotechs are supported by a strong academic structure, the country lacks Silicon Valley’s aggressive entrepreneurial mindset. It’s not just about the research anymore.

In this highly competitive entrepreneurial climate, scientists need a comprehensive business approach to push their research onto the market. San Francisco-based IndieBio, an accelerator for biotechs, is doing just that: supporting scientists in their research as well as mentoring them on how to pitch to investors.
Nonetheless, an overzealous marketing strategy can also be detrimental, as was the case for Theranos, where the founder’s charisma took precedence over actual scientific data. Fickle hypes can therefore be misleading and blow into over-valuations. This is where the risk-averseness of the Swiss pays off at times, especially in an industry as non-transparent as biotechnology.
In either case, funding is needed — something Bay Area biotechs aren’t deprived of. Their funding has increased from $1.89 billion in 2014 to $2.76 billion in 2015, according to the MoneyTree Reports published by PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) LLP and the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA). “Investments in the Silicon Valley biotech industry are on pace to reach the second highest level in MoneyTree history,” states Greg Vlahos, a Life Science Partner at PwC. “This shows continued confidence from the venture community.”
Unfortunately, this does not translate to Switzerland. Even though the country thrives on its private banking system, biotechs (and startups in general) are having a hard time tapping into Series A and B funding as the excess capital generated isn’t effectively converted into risk capital.
“Although Switzerland places 30% of its national income into savings, two thirds of this amount are redirected into collective saving structures rather than direct investments,” says Benoit Dubuis, the Director of Campus Biotech in Geneva. “However, new initiatives are gradually reversing this trend, as can be seen with projects like “Le Fond suisse pour l’avenir” (The Swiss Fund for the future), which aims to invest part of the capital collected by pension funds into venture capital.”

While Swiss entrepreneurs patiently wait for the implementation of these projects, a step in that direction has already been taken. Invested capital in Swiss startups has increased from CHF 450 million ($465.6 million) in 2014 to CHF 650 million ($672.6 million) in 2015, according to the 2016 Swiss Venture Capital Report. On the life sciences front, biotechs raised more than 63 percent in financing over the previous year, totaling an amount of CHF 310.7 million ($319.2 million) in 2015.
Top VC firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Index Ventures have jumped on the bandwagon by launching sector-specific funds dedicated to life sciences. In the case of Andreessen Horowitz, the Sand Hill Road powerhouse launched a $200 million a16z Bio Fund last year, which invests in mostly early-stage startups at the intersection of computer science and life sciences.
Geneva-headquartered Index Ventures set up Index Life VI in 2012, a life sciences-focused fund, which resulted in the creation of an independent venture firm earlier this year baptized Medixci Ventures. It invests primarily in Europe, with a particular focus on therapeutics.
“Although trade sales continue to be a viable exit strategy, the biotech segment of the public markets is much more robust and visible than it was 10 years ago,” explains Bruce W. Jenett, Senior Counsel in life sciences at DLA Pipier LLP. “Biotech IPOs are therefore a very promising bet for liquidity.” And he is right: of the 18 venture-backed IPOs during the first 6 months of 2016, 14 were biotech companies.
In light of this, Silicon Valley is the right place to be as IPOs are rare (almost non-existent) in Switzerland. Be it the size of the market, the vibrancy of the stock market or the number of VCs, California-based biotechs have the best chance of exiting through a successful and fruitful IPO.",2016-09-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/img_0002.jpg?w=738,"genentech,biotechnology",The biotech empires of Silicon Valley and Europe
629,Dennis Mitzner,"

The EU’s efforts to regulate financial markets has opened new opportunities for global fintech operators looking for universal standards to tap into the lucrative 28-country marketplace. While over-regulation can stifle growth, the fintech industry, in pursuit of consumer trust, has a lot to gain from a clearly defined regulatory framework.
“Fintech startups will need a very clear regulatory and compliance strategy as well as their product and marketing strategies. The new regulatory environment is beneficial for those fintech companies that are building data-driven businesses with transparency and data-integrity as the backbone,” said Marta Sjögren from Northzone, a Stockholm-based investment fund.
Regulation often is an entry barrier because companies must be licensed by regulatory bodies to do business in each jurisdiction. For startups that want to expand, compliance is mandatory and the financial system has low tolerance for risk.
“As a result, founders need to cooperate with regulators, budget for long waiting periods, find strategic partnerships that help their growth efforts and be in this for the long haul. Fintech is a marathon, not a sprint,” wrote Falguni Desai, the founder of Future Asia Ventures, in a recent white paper.
The lengthy process to produce a clear regulatory space and the three-way dance between fintech startups, banks and regulators are meant to create a safe environment for the consumer.
What’s more, the entire value proposition of supple fintech companies — in contrast to often rigid banks — comes down to delivering superior financial products more efficiently with lower costs. If fintech companies want to be a better alternative, they need to gain the trust of the consumer. This is where the role of the regulator becomes essential.
“At the end of the day, the aim is to protect as well as develop a trusting relationship with the consumer. Previously protecting the consumer and developing trust used to be done by one entity: the banks. Going forward, this might not be the case,” says Sjögren.
In recent years, the EU has introduced a plethora of regulations, from standardized mobile and internet payments (PSD2) to voluntary regulatory framework on bank capital adequacy, stress testing (Basel 3), the Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD), a European-wide initiative to standardize the processing of electronic payments in Euro (SEPA), harmonized regulation for investment (MiFID2), harmonized EU-wide insurance regulatory regime (Solvency2), a set of accounting standards (IFRS) and now the soon-to-be launched e-invoicing directive requiring all 28 EU member states to use specific e-invoicing standards for all B2G e-invoices by November 27, 2018.
Europe’s current e-invoicing adoption rate of 24 percent is expected to rise to 95 percent by 2024 and accrue savings of approximately 64.5 billion euros ($72 billion) per year for businesses.
Without underestimating the lure of saving a cent, most of the regulations of the last years have been a direct result of the 2008 financial crisis. For new players, especially fintech, the new regulatory environment is a godsend, as compliance is crucial for fintech businesses.
“The financial crisis has meant regulatory entities have been proactive both in Europe and the U.S., creating opportunities for new incumbents, but compliance is absolutely crucial,” said Sjögren whose fund recently took part in Helsinki-based e-invoicing platform Zervant’s $4.5 million round.
According to Sjögren, the financial industry is entangled in legacy infrastructure and decayed processes as old institutions have amassed centuries of data that have created conservative operational models that look to protect capital through static models, as opposed to using data in real time to assess risk.
“Having become the epicenter of economies, these have in turn become monopolies in their own right,” said Sjögren.
Regulatory measures, such as PSD2, will force banks to open their systems to fintech businesses and the of launch APIs will allow startups to function as intermediaries between banks and customers.
“Fintech is quickly becoming the connective tissue for businesses around the world. When disparate systems and processes are connected, all business partners benefit through improved efficiency and insight to drive agile financial and business strategies. This helps them be more successful in increasingly competitive and volatile markets, powering economic growth,” said Cedric Bru, the CEO of payments supplier software Taulia.
For companies like Zervant, new regulations lower the entry barriers for all players. For example, the e-invoicing directive, if successful, will take the European marketplace toward full digitization, making it easier for other online-based solutions to emerge.
“The EU directive on electronic invoicing is great for us as it drives the digitalization of the invoicing segment. For small business — our core market — it means that they have to switch to using an invoicing software within a few years,” said Mattias Hansson, CEO and co-founder of Zervant.
Digitization, coupled with an emerging consent on what the future regulatory framework should look like, is paving the way for all actors in fintech, whether B2B, B2C or B2G.
“Common standards are extremely useful as they speed up the pace at which businesses can connect. There is a great opportunity for public and private partnership in developing the most relevant and impactful standards and guidelines that will allow all participants — irrespective of their size or industry — to reap the benefits of connected business,” said Bru.
While many fintech founders and investors have expressed concerns over the ambiguity and confusion of regulations, and there is such a thing as too much regulation, for the burgeoning financial technology industry — except for a few exceptions — too much might still be better than too little. Thanks to the country’s supportive regulatory support network, the U.K. is a leading fintech hub.
For other regulatory bodies such as the EU, the challenge is to avoid the many bureaucratic pitfalls of overregulation and instead embrace an open and progressive approach toward fintech.",2016-09-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/moneygrowth.jpg?w=738,"european-union,fintech",The EU’s new regulatory environment might help fintech flourish
630,Romain Dillet,"When I first covered Fleex, it was a neat little video player that let you learn English using your favorite movies or TV shows. Since then, Reverso has acqui-hired the team behind Fleex and now plans to relaunch the language learning platform with a new killer feature — Netflix shows.
Maybe I’m biased because it’s basically how I learned English, but I think watching all your movies and TV shows in a foreign language will drastically help you when it comes to learning that language.
At first, you start with subtitles, then you switch the language of the subtitles so that both the audio and the subtitles are in the foreign language. Then you drop the subtitles altogether. You’ve got to force yourself so that when you go to the next phase it feels difficult to understand at first.
On Fleex, you start with subtitles in both your native language and English. Slowly, Fleex removes subtitles in your native language. For the hardest parts of the video, you still get subtitles in both languages, but not all the time. Then Fleex removes subtitles completely.
At any time, you can pause the video, click on a word to look up the definition in Reverso Context and add it to your list of words you want to learn.
Fleex costs €6.90 per month or €39 per year. It still works with TED talks and your personal videos if you don’t download the Fleex player on your computer. But the company is also adding Netflix as a source. I couldn’t try it yet, but it’s supposed to go live any day.
So how does Netflix support work? It’s a client-side integration. Netflix doesn’t have an API, but uses an HTML5 player that browser extensions can play with. For instance, you can add subtitles and interactions on top of the Netflix player.
“Netflix wasn’t available internationally a couple of years ago,” Reverso CEO Theo Hoffenberg told me. “But now, Netflix is quite open and we can work with the Netflix player directly. It’s not an API, but it’s open.”
The good thing is that Netflix can’t stop them from doing that as everything happens in your browser. From Netflix’s servers, it looks like yet another person streaming a show on Netflix. And Netflix will probably be happy that you’re spending more time (and money) watching Netflix content anyway — it’s a win-win.",2016-09-02,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/english_and_american_boxes.jpg?w=738,"language-learning,france-newsletter,reverso,fleex",Fleex now lets you learn English by streaming Netflix shows
631,Romain Dillet,"British media company Sky just disclosed an investment of $4.5 million (€4 million) in French startup Molotov. From what we’ve heard and according to Sky’s statement, this is just a fraction of a bigger round that is going to be announced at a later date.
“This investment is part of a larger Molotov financing round,” the release says. The reason why Sky is announcing this investment today is that Sky is a public company. It needs to disclose to its investors this kind of investments. It looks like Molotov doesn’t want to talk about this mysterious bigger round just yet.
Interestingly, Sky doesn’t operate in France. By investing in Molotov, Sky is betting on a startup to start entering the French market. The company has also invested in iFlix, an Asia-based Netflix rival.
If you don’t live in France, chances are you don’t know Molotov yet. Molotov is a TV streaming service that tries to reinvent the way you watch and consume TV content.
Molotov has signed deals with all major TV channels so that you can sign up to a Molotov account and access a ton of content. You can watch live TV like on a traditional cable box. If you’ve missed the beginning of a movie, you can start playing from the beginning. You can also play content that has already aired.
And finally, you can bookmark movies, documentaries, shows and store them in the cloud — this feature is disabled for now as it’s not yet officially legal to use someone else’s servers as a next generation VHS recorder. Molotov uses a freemium model. Basic accounts are free, you can then subscribe to options to access more channels and features.
The result is a seamless experience that works across all your device. You can start watching something on your iPhone and continue on your Apple TV once you’re home. This experience will feel familiar if you’ve been using Spotify. But it’s something new for TV in France.",2016-09-02,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/molotov-ipad-9.jpg?w=738,"sky,france-newsletter,molotov",Molotov raises $4.5 million from Sky as part of a bigger round

633,Romain Dillet,"Turning your good old radiator into a connected, smart radiator could be a dream of yours. Imagine being able to control the temperature of each radiator individually without having to move from the couch! If that’s your thing, Netatmo just announced Netatmo Valves. As the name suggest, these devices replace the existing valves on your radiator.
Netatmo has already released a smart thermostat to control your heating remotely and more intelligently. But what if there’s nobody in the bedrooms during the day and you still keep heating them?
The Netatmo Valves are more granular. They connect to your network and allows you to turn up or down your radiator in a particular room. You could set different schedules for the bathroom, the bedrooms and more.
The company says that it works with normal hot water radiators, and specifically European ones — these radiators are quite common in Europe. More interestingly, the valves can detect when a window is open and stop heating a room.
The valves will also try to gather information about the environment (if people are in the room for example) to adjust the temperature. It has an e-ink display so that you can see the temperature directly on the radiator.
Finally, these valves work with HomeKit. With iOS 10, you’ll be able to control your radiators directly from the operating system’s control center. You can also configure accessories using Siri.
The Netatmo Valves will be available at the end of 2016 for around $80 each (£59.99). If you have a lot of radiators, it could get expensive, but not all of your rooms need special treatment.",2016-09-01,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/vannes-thermostat-radiateur-cmjn.jpg?w=738,"ifa,france-newsletter,smart-home,netatmo","Netatmo launches valves to turn your dumb, dumb radiator into a smart one"
634,Ingrid Lunden,"The race for who will take the lead in the next generation of automotive technology is on, and today Uber is kicking off a program that it hopes will help put it in pole position. Today, the transportation-on-demand behemoth is launching a new electric car service in the UK, in partnership with Nissan and China’s BYD, where it will offer leasing (not purchasing) options for fully-electric cars (BYD E6s and Nissan Leafs) to its drivers, as well as include those vehicles in the mix of cars that it offers to passengers for journeys.
“The cars through this partnership are for rent, not for purchase, and will be at rates lower than the cheapest rentals in the market for other private hire vehicles (in order to encourage drivers to make the switch from their existing vehicle),” a spokesperson from Uber tells us. “Obviously running costs are quite a bit lower too – although how much lower obviously depends what car they are switching from.”
Uber is starting first with 50 vehicles in London and — if all goes as planned — it will expand the service to another UK city in coming months, and projects to have “hundreds” of all-electric vehicles on the roads in the UK by next year.
Uber’s move to expand into electric cars is significant for a few reasons: for one, it builds on the company’s efforts to make sure that whatever direction cars may be moving in the years ahead, it will have a place at the table as one of the companies leading the charge.
Uber may not (yet) be fully using its own self-driving vehicles, which go hand-in-hand with self-driving cars in the next generation of automotive technology. But as a large company in the transportation industry, programs like this will help Uber have the ability to influence how these cars are made by third parties, and will also give it a good route into being a middle man in the leasing of these vehicles, potentially developing that business into a useful revenue stream to diversify from basic transportation (or delivery) on-demand services.
Moving into leasing services is a route that companies like Didi in China (which recently acquired/merged with Uber’s business in the country) and Ola in India have also taken in China to expand their businesses.
(Didi, as a side note, is also making further moves to expand its reach in another way: today the company announced that it would work with some 50 other transportation-on-demand businesses to provide a platform to help them organise and look for ride requests more efficiently. You can think of this as Didi’s equivalent to Amazon or Alibaba’s marketplace, where they are offering their transportation platform as a service to independent vendors.)
Second of all, it’s a smart move to improve Uber’s profile, both with lawmakers and regulators in the cities where it operates as well as with consumers and drivers, too. As a company with automotive transportation as its core building block, making investments into further electric car transportation and figuring out effective, alternative forms of fuel beyond gasoline to improve he environment, especially in large cities clogged with pollution (London, as an old city, has a lot of homes on very busy roads) are very obvious moves in Uber’s larger corporate social responsibility strategy, and also more directly to help improve its image, which has not always been positive.
The partnership being announced today plays on some earlier forays that Uber has made into adding electric vehicles into its fleet.
These include a trial that Uber started last year in Chicago, also with BYD, to offer electric cars as part of its UberX service, which offers rides in smaller, private-style vehicles for a lower cost than Uber’s higher-end tiers. An Uber spokesperson tells us that Uber is aiming the UK service at the same tier of users. We have asked how the Chicago trial is progressing and will update as we find out more.
There have been other electric car projects from Uber as well: they include a one-month trial earlier this year in South Africa, which has already ended. And in Portugal earlier this year, Uber also trialled an electric car service called Uber Green for three months. (Again, we’ve asked Uber for an update on these two as well.)
The difference with the UK project is that the cars will be part of the bigger mix of offerings, meaning as a passenger you might end up in an electric vehicle, or a Prius hybrid, or a more standard car.
Unlike some transport companies, such as Uber’s competitor in the UK, Addison Lee, Uber’s fleet is not owned by the company itself but comes as part of its deals with drivers to use its platform. That, essentially, gives Uber some flexibility in how it grows and a mandate to encourage and vet vehicles on the platform, but ultimately it must also rely on those drivers to have the initiative to upgrade. Uber says that some 60% of rides in London already take place in Prius-style hybrid cars.
“People already associate Uber with hybrid cars, but we now want to go a big step further with fully electric cars on the road from today,” said Jo Betram, the GM for Uber in the UK. “We are determined to use technology to help tackle the challenge of air pollution in London and across the UK. Our car-sharing service has already saved more than 1.3 million miles and 231 metric tonnes of CO2. With electric vehicles – and more people sharing their journey and leaving their own cars at home – there’s even more we can do.”
As with the other projects, Uber’s working with other groups to monitor the progress of its electric car service. The Energy Saving Trust (EST) will run a study “into the feasibility of running large numbers of electric private hire vehicles in the UK. In particular, the EST will research the experience, driving patterns and economics of private hire drivers using electric cars, and the capacity of London’s current network of charging points to support these vehicles.”
“We are delighted to be working with Uber to help realise and build upon their ambition to add a significant number of electric vehicles to their app,” said Andrew Benfield, Group Director of Transport at the Energy Saving Trust, in a statement. We hope that this trial represents an important step in Uber’s contribution towards the wider efforts to improve air quality in the capital – the benefits of which will be felt by all.”

635,Haje Jan Kamps,"London-based Pusher, the company powering The NY Times’ live election results and DraftKing’s fantasy scoring results, just raised $2.5 million to up its stakes further. The money came from SaaS Capital, which focuses on debt financing aimed at the Software as a Service (SaaS) space.
The company has seen strong organic growth so far, with more than 100,000 developers using Pusher to deliver content to their customers. It built a profitable business after raising a modest seed round in 2011. The company claims it is profitable, and has earmarked the funding for product development and marketing.

636,Steve O'Hear,"Swedish startup Greta is on a somewhat quiet mission to disrupt the multi-billion dollar Content Delivery Network (CDN) market. The young company already boasts an impressive list of angel investors — including Jan Erik Solem (founder Polar Rose and Mapillary), Hampus Jakobsson (founder TAT and Brisk), and Jeremy Yap (recently awarded best angel investor at The Europas) — and now new VC BlueYard Capital has also become a backer.
The Berlin-based VC has led a $1.1 million seed round in Greta, while Sophia Bendz, previously Global Director of Marketing at Spotify and now Executive in Residence at VC Atomico, also joins the lists of investors. I also understand that it was BlueYard’s investment thesis, which talks about the “decentralisation of markets” and “democratisation of capabilities”, that first brought the VC to Greta’s attention.
“We had other VCs who wanted to get in on the round but we decided to go with BlueYard as the only institutional investor at this stage as our primary aim wasn’t to secure funding but rather to get access to BlueYards’ knowledge and global network,” Anna Ottosson, CEO and co-founder of Greta, tells me.
“We were really determined on not raising our seed round until end of this year, but when we met with Jason Whitmire, partner at BlueYard for the first time we got extremely intrigued by their thesis and how they looked at the world. They have already proven that they’re willing to take bold bets on technology startups and that they’re serious about their mission to upgrade the internet, which is very much in line with our vision for Greta”.
Launched late last year, Greta has developed tech that is able to calculate the most efficient route for site content, such as images and video, and deliver it via traditional server and CDN providers or Greta’s own peer-to-peer solution, based on whichever of the two will provide the best experience for end users.
“The problem we’re solving is that it’s difficult for companies to provide their end users with sufficient site performance, meaning that companies are losing out on potential revenue as well as consumers having to suffer through buffering videos and wasting their time waiting for slow sites to load,” says Ottosson.
“Furthermore, it’s often at the most critical times that it is the most difficult to deliver good site performance to your users, as an increase in number of concurrent site visitors often increases the risk of this type of performance issues,” she adds.
Those critical times might be a video streaming service during an important live sports event, an e-commerce company launching a new campaign or a news site breaking its biggest scoop of the year. Or even a startup reaching number one on something like Hacker News and crashing due to high server load. And that’s where Greta’s one line of JavaScript comes into play.
“When Greta’s script is added to a site, the site’s traffic will be analyzed in real time, and within a few hours Greta will start suggesting site specific actions to improve your site performance, such as switching CDN in a specific region, or turning on Greta’s own peer-to-peer solution,” explains Ottosson.
“Greta’s peer-to-peer solution is based on webRTC and enables peer-to-peer content delivery directly in the browser, meaning that performance issues such as video buffering and slow or crashing sites can be avoided, especially during heavy traffic. Greta will always optimize for providing the end users with the best user experience possible”.
Meanwhile, the fact that Greta is able to switch to browser-based P2P content delivery, without requiring the end user to explicitly download and install any extra software (presuming their browser supports webRTC), means that site and media streaming improvement can happen in regions where there might not be close proximity to existing CDN networks, such as in Africa or the Middle East.
Adds Ottosson: “Traditional CDNs are restrained by building physical infrastructure, which Greta is not, meaning that they have to build out their network in order to provide their customers with better performance. The existing CDN infrastructure is heavily concentrated to Western Europe and North America, with very limited infrastructure in regions such as the Middle East and Africa where internet traffic is growing with over 40 per cent year on year”.",2016-08-30,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/greta-dashboard.png?w=738,,Sweden’s Greta wants to disrupt the multi-billion dollar CDN market
637,Romain Dillet,"The bill is getting quite expensive as the European Commission has just released a statement saying that Apple has benefited from illegal tax benefits in Ireland for its European operations. The commission says that Ireland must recover the “illegal aid” — it is worth $14.5 billion (€13 billion).
The debate over European taxes has been an ongoing issue for the past few years. While it’s not illegal to choose Ireland as your main country for your European headquarters, Ireland has gone one step further and granted tax benefits for Apple specifically. This is unfair for other companies headquartered in Ireland and Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has decided that it’s illegal and Apple must repay these tax benefits.
“Member States cannot give tax benefits to selected companies – this is illegal under EU state aid rules,” Vestager wrote. “The Commission’s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years. In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014.”
In particular, Apple has optimized its tax structure by creating a company that only exists on paper. Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, two Irish-based subsidiaries of Apple Inc., attributed the vast majority of their profit to a “head office.” This head office isn’t based in any country on earth, under the sea, or anywhere. So this profit remained untaxed for year, greatly lowering the effective tax rate.
While the total amount of the fine isn’t clear just yet, the European Commission says that Apple has benefited from $14.5 billion in tax benefits. The Commission has the power to fine Apple for a ten-year period preceding the first request for information in 2013. So Apple is getting fined for the period from 2003 to 2014 and also owes interests. Apple and the Irish government could negotiate a deal and the company could end up paying less than that. Apple will also probably contest the decision. Apple changed its structure in Ireland in 2015, so the company now complies with the taxation law in Europe.
Update: Tim Cook has written a letter on today’s decision.
“The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process. The opinion issued on August 30th alleges that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on our taxes,” Cook wrote. “This claim has no basis in fact or in law. We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don’t owe them any more than we’ve already paid.”
Cook even says that it sets a bad precedent for EU member states (Ireland is still getting billions of dollars though…). “The Commission’s move is unprecedented and it has serious, wide-reaching implications. It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been,” Cook wrote. “This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe. Ireland has said they plan to appeal the Commission’s ruling and Apple will do the same. We are confident that the Commission’s order will be reversed.”
Of course, Apple already has a ton of money outside of the U.S., sitting there and doing nothing. During its last earnings report, the company reported $231.5 billion in cash on hand. A significant portion of this big pile of cash is unrepatriated foreign earnings as the U.S. taxes foreign profit just like domestic profit. Paying back Ireland shouldn’t be an issue.
But today’s decision still raises an important question. Should the European Commission chase companies that build complicated schemes to lower their effective tax rates in Europe? Or should the European Union harmonize its corporate tax structure so that companies pay the same amount in all European countries?
Today’s fine is the result of an investigation that started in June 2014. Other American companies are currently being investigated for tax non-compliance — Google’s parent company Alphabet, Starbucks and McDonald’s could be next.

638,Jon Russell,"Budget hotel aggregators were one of the breakout startup ideas of last year, particularly in India. Hype around the industry has quietened down this year but there’s a big round today: Treebo Hotels has raised $17 million led by Bertelsmann India Investments with participation from existing investors SAIF Partners and Matrix Partners India.
Founded in June 2015 initially as Zipotel, Bangalore-based Treebo is a ‘tech-powered’ budget hotel aggregator that provides a standard of accommodation across a network of partner hotels in India, for example clean linen, bedding, free WiFi etc. Typical room cost is between $15 and $50. It sounds basic to Western standards but, as anyone who has ever traveled off the beaten path in Asia can testify, many of these things are often missing — and that can be very painful.
It’s much the same as the model pioneered by OYO Rooms, a popular startup that has raised over $125 million from the likes of SoftBank.
Treebo started out with just four hotel partners in Bangalore, now it has 125 hotels, covering around 3,000 rooms, across 25 cities in India. In an interview with TechCrunch, Treebo co-founder Rahul Chaudhary said that the company is aiming to reach at least 800 hotels before the end of 2017.
“India has a population of more than one billion which is a fairly large opportunity,” he said. “Budget accounts for around 65 percent of the market so we’re talking about [an industry that is worth] north of $15-20 billion per year.”
Chaudhary said that Treebo plans to invest the capital it has raised in three major areas: increasing its marketing and branding efforts, expanding its geographical footprint in India (as above), and further developing its technology stack.
“We’re building a large consumer brand and have taken a fairly brand-led approach compared to others,” he said. “But we can’t get into a ‘loved’ brand arena without significant brand marketing spend.”
In terms of technology, he explained that the company’s current headcount for tech — which includes product development and design — would double to 80 people before the end of this year.
“We want to build a digital hotel company,” he explained. “We are building the hospitality side but also need to build the tech.”
One thing to note about Treebo, which differentiates it from others in the budget hotel aggregation space, is that the company works exclusively with its partners in a franchise-style approach. That means that partner hotels use Treebo, and Treebo only, to manage their bookings and stays. So, while other networks allow hotels to list their rooms on other travel booking sites too or just sell partial inventory, Treebo runs what it calls a “full inventory model.”
OYO and others have headed overseas with their idea, and numerous companies have sprouted up in Southeast Asia, including Rocket Internet-backed Zen Rooms and RedDoorz, but Chaudhary said Treebo is not tempted to look outside of India.
“Not in the foreseeable future,” he said, “but I won’t rule out creating tech that can be replicated in say Vietnam or Romania, this is an emerging market problem. There’s a long long way to go and India can keep us busy for the next two to three years.”",2016-07-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/screenshot-2016-07-22-18-54-43.png?w=738,"india,budget-hotel,budget-hotel-network",India’s Treebo Hotels raises $17 million for its budget hotel network
639,Jon Russell,"It isn’t often that ride-sharing companies can introduce new services or products that really go much beyond what they already offer, i.e. trips in vehicles, but that’s what Grab, the company rivaling Uber in Southeast Asia, is aiming to do.
The Singapore-based firm said today it plans to allow its users to pay for items outside of its service using its payment system. ‘GrabPay,’ its cash-less digital wallet service, was first announced earlier this year and sits inside its app.
“Grab will integrate the payments platform into the Grab app as a mobile wallet option within GrabPay, enabling any mobile user to use the Grab app to pay for not only their daily transport needs, but also other lifestyle services,” the company explained.
Grab is initially targeting Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest country with a population of some 250 million people, with the aim of providing a ‘payment platform’ to users there before the end of this year. It has partnered up with Lippo, a billion dollar Indonesian retail conglomerate, on the project. Lippo, which is a Grab investor and has ventured into e-commerce and tech investments, will be the first retail partner, enabling customers of its businesses — which include department stores, cinemas and online shops — to pay via the Grab app. Over time, support for other retailers could be added.
Ride-sharing to payments may seem like a curious expansion, but it is entirely logical in emerging markets where there is no single dominant payment system. Not only does it help strengthen engagement with existing users, who can potential use it more regularly, but it could help widen Grab’s userbase by appealing to more people, too. “Could” is the operative word here because the online payment scene is hugely fragmented with mobile operators, banks and others like messaging app Line pushing their own solutions on the market. Getting Lippo on board is a big boost for Grab, for sure, but it is by no means game, set and match.
“The potential of developing a mobile payments platform in Southeast Asia is limitless,” Grab CEO Anthony Tan said in a statement. “The majority in Southeast Asia are unbanked but are armed with mobile phones. We need to find a cashless solution that helps them manage their money and mobile wallets is one way forward.”
We’ve seen this move before in Asia. Ola, Uber’s rival in India and an ally to Grab, spun its in-app payment systems into a standalone app last November. Grab is keeping its service inside its core app, for now at least, but the company is sure to have been in contact with Ola, its fellow “Anti Uber Alliance” member, for tips and pointers.
Grab’s business is more than just Indonesia, although the company recently said the country is its largest in terms of rides completed, and it hinted that this Grab Pay platform initiative will at some point expand to its five other markets: Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines and Malaysia.
“We will work with local partners to make cashless transactions a reality for the majority in Southeast Asia,” the company said in a statement.",2016-07-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/photo-18-06-2016-14-33-31.jpg?w=738,"indonesia,southeast-asia,grab","Grab, Uber’s rival in Southeast Asia, is developing a mobile payments platform"
640,Jon Russell,"Global Fashion Group (GFG), the umbrella group that manages Rocket Internet-backed online fashion businesses worldwide, has added €30 million ($33 million) to a €300 million round that it announced back in April.
That deal was a curious one, being that it valued GFG at €1 billion ($1.1 billion), a valuation that is massively down on its previous funding activity when the group raised $167 million at a $3.4 billion valuation in the summer of last year. This latest round has closed at €330 million ($365 million) and retained that same $1.1 billion valuation.
Rocket Internet said in a statement that the round sized increased “due to high demand.” In all fairness though, this is very often how Rocket Internet fundraising goes and we cautioned in our original reporting of this round that the final figure raised could well increase, so bear that in mind when considering the “high demand.”
It’s certainly interesting to note also that Rocket Internet and Kinnevik (its close ally and regular investing partner) provided the initial €300 million in its entirety together. Other “undisclosed” investors only added the extra €30 million — and, even then, the only investor named in today’s press release is Rocket Internet Capital Partners fund, which is aligned with… you guessed it… Rocket Internet.
Rocket Internet declined to name other investors when we asked.
It remains to be seen whether other investors were offered a spot in the initial €300 million tranche, and thus rejected the offer, or whether Rocket Internet decided to make the injection with Kinnevik from the start, and thus the valuation of the round was lower in order to secure maximum stakes.
A source from inside the group told TechCrunch that GFG CEO Romain Voog, who joined the business from Amazon in 2015, met with more than 90 investors from across the world in his efforts to raise capital but “couldn’t get a penny from them.” The person, who spoke to TechCrunch anonymously, suggested that the fundraising roadshow had been arranged in a hurry which didn’t help the (already challenging) cause.
That certainly plays into the idea that this round was drawn up in haste, which would explain why Rocket and Kinnevik forged ahead with the large chunk. Other Rocket Internet-backed companies have raised money from legitimate investors with no direct linkage to the mothership. Temasek and Tesco are among those which invested in Lazada, its Amazon-like service in Southeast Asia, so going outside of the usual circle of Rocket Internet-friendly investors is possible. But it appears that GFG wasn’t able to drum up that level of interest.
GFG encompasses Rocket Internet’s emerging market fashion business, that’s Dafiti in Latin America, Lamoda in Russia and CIS, Namshi in the Middle East, Zalora and The Iconic in Asia Pacific and Jabong in India. The firm has been cutting back and streamlining its presence in Asia, in particular, with Jabong continually reported to be up for sale, and Zalora trimming back with the sale of its businesses in Vietnam and Thailand. Our source suggested that there could be further sales as other business units deemed unnecessary are discarded from GFG.
Following this round, Rocket Internet confirmed that it owns a total of 20.4 percent of GFG.

641,Jon Russell,"Good news for early-stage startup founders in Southeast Asia: KK Fund just completed the first close of a new fund for seed stage investments.
This second fund is larger but undisclosed, like the firm’s first, but it is notable because it comes less than two years after that inaugural fund and its LP base is another reminder of strong interest in Southeast Asia from Japan. Tokyo-listed duo Sega Sammy Holdings and ad firm Septeni Holdings invested in the fund, alongside investment group Mistletoe, and a number of undisclosed family offices and individuals from Japan, the firm said.
Singapore-based KK Fund was founded in 2014 by general partners Kuan Hsu, formerly of GREE Ventures, and Koichi Saito, formerly with IMJ Investment. It has invested in more than a dozen deals from its first fund, which Saito told TechCrunch is not fully spent. That means that, in some cases, KK Fund will make investments across both of its funds.
Saito explained that the new fund will allow KK Fund to increase its typical check size to around $400,000-$500,000 per investment. The firm is entirely focused on Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and, in particular, companies within the online marketplace, logistics, fintech, and media and entertainment verticals.
Typically, KK Fund will be the lead investor in deals — indeed $500,000 is a large amount to put into a seed or pre-Series A round in this past of the world — and it is predominantly looking for companies with a product, or early release, in the market already. Saito said that they have done a couple of investments pre-product when they are impressed by the team.
There are plenty of Japanese investors as LPs within high-profile funds in Southeast Asia. Naver, the company behind newly listed Line, aligned itself with Golden Gate Ventures, while YC Capital (Yahoo Japan) invested in Monk’s Hill Ventures, but KK Fund targets a far earlier stage than those two.
So what is it about Southeast Asia that appeals to its Japanese LPs exactly?
The Japanese market is challenging for tech startups, not only due to some rigid business cultures but also the aging population and the fact that its economy is one of the planet’s most mature. Saito said that many investors are looking to green field markets like Southeast Asia, which is tipped to grow its ‘internet economy’ to $200 billion annually inside a decade, to find businesses and industries than can grow fast.
“There’s still a strong appetite for Southeast Asia,” he told me over the phone. “We started talking [to investors] in April and made our first close at the end of June. That’s quite quick, quicker than what we expected.”
“In Japan, there are a lot of regulations in terms of finance and logistics, so not many startups are active in that space,” he added of investor motivation to pursue new business opportunities. “One Japanese [LP] company wants to import business to Japan or use Southeast Asia as a test bed market, so that is an attractive part.”
KK Fund expects the final close of its second fund before the end of the year, and it has already begun investing the capital raised thus far.
The firm has also added a new face to its ranks. Singapore-based Masahiko Honma has joined as partner from Incubate Fund, a Japanese seed fund. In his native Japan, Honma previously co-founded game development company Pokelabo which was bought by GREE for $173 million in 2012. That gives him another tie to KK Fund’s founding partners.",2016-07-21,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/southeast-asia-map.jpg?w=738,"southeast-asia,koichi-saito,kk-fund",KK Fund announces second fund for early-stage startups in Southeast Asia
642,Jon Russell,"Pokémon Go has finally launched in Japan, the land where Pokémania began. McDonald’s is the game’s first sponsor in a deal which, as we reported earlier this week, turns the fast food firm’s 3,000 stores in the country into Pokémon Go “gyms”.
The launch has been a long while coming for Japanese fans to say the least. The smash hit title first went live in the U.S. over two weeks ago, before coming to most of Europe and Canada last week. That’s left many Japanese fans disappointed at having to watch without being able to join in the fun.
Even today’s launch hasn’t been without drama. The game has been ready to launch in Japan for days now, as we previously reported, but internal disagreement and a leak held things up. On Tuesday, we reported that the game would debut on Wednesday and that seemed the case right up until the eleven hour when a leaked email from McDonald’s made Niantic, Nintendo and the Pokémon Company change their mind. A source close to the launch told TechCrunch that the Wednesday release time was originally 9:00 am before being pushed back to 2:00 pm and then canceled altogether.
That’s all in the past now, and today’s release also coincides with school holidays in Japan — very deliberately, you’d suspect — which is only likely to give the game a further boost. The big question will be whether the servers, which are already inconsistent for many users across the world, can handle the strain of Japan’s Pokémon addicts piling in.

The success of Pokémon Go, which has overtaken the likes of Twitter and Tinder on active user numbers, has seen Nintendo’s valuation double. This week’s game delay saw Nintendo share price fall for the first time since Pokémon Go’s release, but, with the game now finally out on home soil, the gaming giant is sure to see its market cap rise up once again as its already impressive revenue is boosted both by a glut of new players and the McDonald’s deal.
McDonald’s is the first company to tie up with Pokémon Go, being a sponsored location could help drive customers to branches, and other deals in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are expected and likely to be equally as lucrative.
What’s next for Pokémon Go now?
A source at Niantic told us that Japan would be the ‘halo’ launch in Asia, so we can likely expect that the game will rollout to other markets in the region over the coming week or so. We don’t have details of which ones and when, but Niantic has already suggested that China could be a tricky launch, so that one might be delayed. CEO John Hanke week on record last week saying that he wants the game to be live in 200 countries as soon as possible.

643,Jon Russell,"Fintech companies are beginning to make a significant impact to how people live in Asia. Mywish Marketplaces, one of the more mature startups in what is admittedly a very broad sector, has raised $15 million to push its financing business into new areas.
This isn’t a huge round compared to what other companies have closed, but it is entirely strategic. The capital was proved by Franklin Templeton, the U.S. banking giant with more than $700 billion in assets under management. Puru Vashishtha, who is board director at Mywish Marketplaces, told me in an interview that the company didn’t need to raise the funds and it wasn’t short of interest, but it did so for growth opportunities and was very deliberate with the capital that it did close.
“We were chased by a lot of venture capitalists and investors globally,” Vashishtha said. “Because we were profitable, we did not need to raise a lot and didn’t want to dilute too much too soon — that’s one of the reasons we chose Franklin Templeton. Also, Franklin Templeton has built a very big emerging market business, we want to leverage the experience and leadership of their team.”
Neither party would confirm a valuation for the deal, but TechCrunch understands from a source close to the negotiations that the round values Mywish Marketplaces at $100 million.
To backtrack a little, Mywish Marketplaces operates Deal4Loans, a price comparison and loan aggregation website in India. Its products include credit cards, home loans, business loans and personal loans.
Like Credit Karma in the U.S. and countless others worldwide, it works with banks, credit card companies and other financial institutes to help drive customers, while for its users, it tries to provide a holistic look at financing option and which one suits best for each case. The Deal4Loans site claims to have served more than 6.3 million “satisfied” customers, while the company says it has dispersed a total of $2 billion loans in the last six years at a current rate of $400-$450 million per year.
“We are primarily trying to cater to customers who are in the market for banking products, we are the intermediary between them and banks,” Vashishtha said.
“We ensure they get the best possible advice, make responsible decisions, are given information and transparency,” the former Wall Street hedge fund investor, who joined Mywish Marketplaces in April, added. “We try to understand our customer and matchmake perfectly with the various products available at that point of time, and which banks, via algorithms.”
Vashishtha argued that, rather than just a pipeline for new customers, Deal4Loans streamlines the process to ensure that the right customer focuses on the right banking product, thus minimizing risk that banks would otherwise incur when assessing potential new customers.
“We are neutral so able to get a lot more information on customers and what they are looking for [than a bank would and we] sometimes turn customers away, which lets us target a very high-end,” he explained, although, in the right conditions, he added that a loan or credit can be approved in two minutes.
So why is this profitable company — profitable from day one, it claims — raising money?
I hinted at it earlier, but Mywish Marketplaces wants to expand into more verticals with new financing products for Indian consumers.
“We’re trying to become a financial superstore,” Vashishtha said. “Help customers make decisions right across their financial needs, whether it is loans, credit cards, etc, we want to build a platform to manage their needs.”
Another side to that is expanding the current reach of Deal4Loans.
The service is entirely online, but it relies on partnerships with banks and financial organizations for domestic reach in India, particularly as some areas are better serviced by regional or local players. As of now, Deal4Loans clams to be present in around 200 Indian cities, but Vashishtha said the goal is to increase that to 350-400 through new partnerships and offerings.
Admitting that the company’s core product, a platform that tailors marketing messages and mediums to customers — i.e. learning more about them, suggesting services to them and finding them on various ‘touch points’ (ad placements) across the web — is highly scalable, Vashishtha said that Mywish Marketplaces may well venture outside of India in the future.
“Next year [we may be] keen to expand globally, but first the goal is [to develop a fully] end-to-end experience for our Indian customer base [and] really focus on consolidating our position. At some stage, we may go into the Middle East, Southeast Asia and a few other regions,” he added.",2016-07-21,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/screenshot-2016-07-21-15-31-53.png?w=738,"fintech,india",India’s Mywish Marketplaces raises $15M to expand to new financial products
644,Jon Russell,"Omise, a Bangkok-based payment enabler much like Stripe, has raised a $17.5 million Series B round to expand its reach across Southeast Asia.
The company proves a payment gateway system that allows any retailer take credit card payments online. That’s long been a problem in Southeast Asia, which is compromised of six major countries, each of which requires a different payment solution — Omise is trying to offer a one-stop shop. Right now, its service is available in Thailand and Japan (the birthplace of CEO Jun Hasegawa), but there are plans to expand to Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, where it has carried out closed testing, in the coming months. Beyond that, Omise is looking at reaching Vietnam, the Philippines, and Mekong countries like Burma, Laos and Cambodia at a later date.
This new round, which is one of the largest for a fintech company in Southeast Asia to date, was led by Japan-based SBI Investment, with participation from Sinar Mas Digital Ventures (SMDV) in Indonesia, Thailand’s Ascend Money (affiliated with mobile operator True), and existing backer Golden Gate Ventures. Omise has now raised over $25 million, including a $2.6 million Series A in May 2015 and undisclosed round from Golden Gate Ventures last October, right after the Singapore-based VC firm announced a new $50 million fund.
Omise — which is pronounced ‘Oh-Mee-Say’ and means ‘store’ in Japanese — was founded in 2014 by Hasegawa and Thailand-born COO Ezra “Donnie” Harinsut, who became friends after meeting on a homestay trip.
The startup is focused on tapping the potential of e-commerce in Southeast Asia. Right now, estimates suggest less than five percent of the retail in the region is done online but, with more than 600 million people in the region and an increasingly affluent middle class, there’s a huge opportunity for growth. That’s one reason Alibaba made a $1 billion investment in Rocket Internet-backed ‘Amazon clone’ Lazada earlier this year, while a recent Google report forecast Southeast Asia’s ‘online economy’ will reach $200 billion per year within a decade. Omise wants to be the payment solution of choice for anyone selling online across the region.
There are many rivals, including 2C2P which raised $7 million last year and is powering a social commerce trial with Facebook. Stripe, meanwhile, is in the region, but it appears to be working on creating demand in the U.S. from overseas via its Atlas project, rather than going for a full-on localization approach.
Unlike its local competitors, Omise is solely focused on digital payments and not cash, which counts for around 60 percent of payments online right now in Southeast Asia. Harinsut explained that Omise sees cash-less as the future, and it aims to be faster and better than other solutions, which take multiple days for payout and involve manual processes.
“We’re focusing more on pay out solutions, not only about accepting payments but also paying merchants or vendors. It is currently next day [payment to merchants], but we want instant — we automate everything, batch files and submit to bank, there’s no human involvement in the process. We try to reduce human error, time and fees,” he told TechCrunch in an interview.
E-commerce is the most visible opportunity, but Hasegawa said that Omise is focusing more broadly on online retail beyond startups — that’s one reason it has operations in Japan, because many Japanese retailers are moving into Southeast Asia.
“E-commerce is growing but much [of our business] is from big companies,” he told me. “Small startups aren’t really making progress yet. It is up to us to make it a self-sustainable business, focusing really on enterprises like airlines, insurance companies, mobile network operators and other subscription services like BDO-on-demand, e-retail and e-government. That’s our target segment right now.”
Omise isn’t releasing any figures for its business — we did ask — but Harinsut said the company can reach profitability inside the next year. He explained that the challenge is about reaching suitable scale. Omise makes its money by charging 3.65 percent on transactions, with a one dollar fee for up to 60,000 (1 million THB) withdrawn, but it offers flexible packages for larger customers.
Southeast Asia is the first priority, but the startup’s founders are also looking outside of their immediate geography, including Australia, New Zealand, Korea and Hong Kong, for future opportunities.
“We’re also really interested in India,” Hasegawa told me. “It’s such a big market and there is still a huge gap for e-commerce and financial institutions. I believe they have some space.”
The company has also been bulking up on personnel too lately. June Seah (formerly Visa APAC) and Michael Bradley (ex CyberSource, a Visa company) have joined the Omise advisory board. Bradley has also become Omise’s Chief Commercial Officer, alongside two more new hires: Sanjeev Kumar, also formerly with Visa CyberSource, who has become Chief Product Officer, and Luke Cheng, ex Groupon APAC, who is Omise Chief Financial Officer.",2016-07-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/group_photo-cioctoceocoo.jpg?w=738,"southeast-asia,fintech,payments,omise",Omise lands $17.5M Series B to expand its Stripe-like service in Southeast Asia
645,Jon Russell,"Game-maker Niantic has postponed today’s scheduled launch of Pokémon Go in Japan following an email leak.
Yesterday we reported that the game was due to go live in Japan today (Wednesday), but the companies behind Pokémon Go have canceled that plan, a source close to the launch told TechCrunch. One major reason for that change of heart is that internal communication from McDonalds Japan, the game’s sponsor, detailing the launch made its way to internet forums (including 2ch, “Japan’s Reddit”) and photo site Imgur.
An initial morning launch time was pushed back to early afternoon as the email went viral. Later, however, the companies decided to cancel today’s launch entirely due to concerns that the hype generated would overload the game, our source explained. We don’t have an immediate update on when the game will finally go live in Japan, but understand that the launch is “imminent” but unspecified.
The postponement will frustrate many in Japan who are still waiting but, on the positive side, Niantic, Nintendo and the Pokémon Company — the three firms behind the smash game — are confident that, if the game is launched right, their serves can handle the undoubtedly huge demand that Pokémon Go will generate in Japan. Ninatic CEO John Hanke previously cautioned that the company needed time to ensure it had enough servers to cope with a deluge of Pokémon addicts in Japan.
The delay means also that we will have to wait to see the impact of the first “sponsored location” in the game. McDonalds has agreed to become the first paying sponsor, turning its 3,000 stores in Japan into “gyms” where players can battle, adding a new source of revenue to the game beyond its already lucrative in-app purchases and potentially driving real-world traffic to McDonalds stores. That’ll be a partnership to watch since there are plans to offer sponsored locations in other parts of the world.
The success of Pokémon Go is unprecedented. Just two weeks after its U.S. debut, it has reportedly passed 30 million downloads and $35 million in revenue, and surpassed Twitter on active users and Facebook on engagement. That has doubled the valuation of Nintendo — yes, in just two weeks — and all without launching in Japan, the home of Pokémon, yet.
Pokémon Go is available in more than 30 countries right now thanks to a steady rollout across Europe last week. TechCrunch understands that Japan is planned as the first launch in Asia and, once the game is available there, it will be extended to other countries in the region.

646,Jon Russell,"Pokémon Go fever has doubled the value of Nintendo’s business, pushing it past Sony in the process. Can you imagine what will happen when the game finally goes live in Japan, the birthplace of the Pokémon phenomenon?
Well, you don’t have long to wait since Pokémon Go is scheduled to launch in Japan tomorrow (Wednesday), sources have confirmed to TechCrunch. Niantic, the company behind the title, did not reply to our request for comment.
Pokémon Go is currently available in over 30 countries, including the U.S., Canada and much of Europe, but Japan has so far been left off the list. That’s upset and frustrated a lot of true Pokémon addicts, but Niantic — which has watched the game become more popular than Twitter, Tinder and a host of other top apps — has tried to rationalize the situation.
Niantic CEO John Hanke recently told Forbes that the delay is because the companies behind the app — which include the Pokémon company and Nintendo — want to ensure that its servers are suitably robust to withstand the demand that the Japan launch is sure to generate.
“We expect it to be released by the end of July,” Hanke said.
Well, surprise! Tomorrow has been earmarked as launch day so we won’t have to wait quite that long to watch Pokémania hit Japan.
Beyond the inevitable crazy adoption and likely billions more added to Nintendo’s valuation from the buzz, Pokémon Go’s Japan launch will be notable for another reason: it’ll be the first time that the company has tied up with an official partner.
Hanke previously said that Niantic would augment the already significant revenue that the game is making from in-app purchases by allowing selective partners to become “sponsored locations” in the game. A sponsor can create “gyms” — where Pokémon can be battled or trained by gamers — at their retail store or locations, a move that could drive real-world traffic and potential sales to their business.
TechCrunch understands that McDonald’s will be the first launch partner in a tie-in that will see its 3,000 plus fast food restaurants across Japan become gyms for would-be Pokémon collectors. (Gizmodo previously reported that the two sides were hatching a collaboration somewhere in Asia.)
That’ll be a collaboration to watch since it will be replicated in other parts of the world and, if Pokémon Go can sustain itself beyond a temporary craze, sponsorship could be lucrative for both the game makers and brands seeking to drive foot traffic. Bloomberg reported that McDonald’s Japan has already seen its share price rocket thanks to Pokemon-branded Happy Meal sales, even before the game launch.
Japan will mark the first launch of Pokémon Go in Asia which, Australia and New Zealand aside, has been ignored as Niantic has focused on getting the game to market (and stable) in North America and Europe first. TechCrunch understands that further launches in Asian countries will happen this week and next, so there’s still lots more to come.

647,Jon Russell,"Netflix has an overseas problem. The company’s share price plunged 15 percent week after it reported poorer than expected user growth numbers.
The company blamed confusion around a planned price hike and regulatory issues in China, where it has not yet launched, for the excessive churn — it added just 160,000 subs in the U.S. and 1.5 million overseas — but a couple of major barriers mean Netflix isn’t about to suddenly hit the jackpot overseas, particularly in Asia.
That’s principally because its service remains too expensive for many people, and not compelling enough for others.
As anyone who has signed up for the service from outside of the U.S. since its huge global expansion in January will know, Netflix has far less content internationally — particularly outside of major European countries which have some parity with the U.S..
It’s well documented, and it is a process that will take time to change. Netflix is commissioning original content from places like India and playing a waiting game on other licensing, but until then the sparse entertainment options on offer to many will have a tangible impact on growth.
“When you look at [Netflix] content in Asian countries, it is significantly lower,” Aravind Venugopal, vice president at Singapore-based Media Partners Asia, told TechCrunch in an interview. “It just doesn’t have the amount of local content that some of the [streaming and pay TV] competitors have.”
Netflix has publicly stated its intention to develop a homogenous catalog of content, but at the same time acknowledged that it will take time. Not only is there existing content that it can’t license right now until current terms expire, but there are competitors sprouting up and even the potential for competition from production companies which are experimenting with their own offerings.
Disney, for example, partnered with Alibaba to deliver content in China, although ultimately that partnership was closed down reportedly due to violating regulations. But Venugopal believes that the example shows the ambition that the firm, and others like it, harbor for Asia.
“We’re not sure if local content players will license [content] out [to Netflix]. Disney and Fox have their own ideas [and] might not do same licensing deals here in Asia, so Netflix might not have a compatible product in Asia,” he argued.
Even being compatible won’t be enough, since most consumers in countries like India and beyond predominantly consume local programming, even if they do occasionally enjoy Hollywood movies and other international content here and there. In that respect, Netflix is up against any kind of TV, be it online or offline.

Tied into a lack of content comes the fact that Netflix’s service is comparatively pricey in parts of the world. While a starting fee of $8.99 can be argued away as a couple of cups of coffee by some, the price is harder to bear for others with less spending power. That’s particularly true when local rivals, which include Netflix-like Hooq and iFlix in Southeast Asia and more traditional pay TV services, are cheaper or on par and include significantly larger programming catalogues.
“Pricing is still a massive issue. In most markets [in Asia] Netflix ARPU and pricing is higher than pay TV. [So] if you have a pay TV at home and Netflix, you double your bill,” Venugopal said.
“Even if $9-10 is not an issue then bandwidth may be,” he added. “Except for Singapore and Hong Kong, most countries in Asia have a cap on how much you can upload or download [via fixed broadband and wireless broadband], so you can’t really use Netflix on your phone without incurring major charges.”
There could be an opportunity to break that price rigidity soon, and ironically that might come via Netflix’s stamping out of VPN services which for so long allowed users worldwide to access its top shows from any place in the world regardless of local licensing.
If Netflix can guarantee that it has snuffed out VPNs, and it does seem that the company has managed to do so with much efficiency — much to the disappointment of VPN loyalists like yours truly — then it could be in position to implement varied pricing, just like Spotify and others do. That would mean that it could tailor its price to suit local users and help scoop up more subscribers in places where $8.99 is too expensive, albeit at a lower take home per subscription.
“In certain markets, Netflix might need to look at differential pricing. A top tier customer in the Philippines or Indonesia may be different in earnings capacity compared to Singapore. [In some cases,] a $10 product is more than what you’d pay for pay tv service which gives you access to 300 channels,” Venugopal said.
Being able to ensure that users can’t use VPNs is crucial here, Venugopal explained, because otherwise U.S.-based subscribers could sign up via cheaper countries.
One bright spot for Netflix is its efforts to strike partnerships with distribution platforms. In Singapore it working with carrier Singtel and StarHub’s fiber TV service, in the Philippines it has joined forces with Globe Telecom, and there are likely other tie-ups in the pipeline to help its distribution efforts.
Ultimately the Media Partners Asia analyst doesn’t expect Netflix to implement major changes to its global product any time soon, so the U.S. company may continue to deliver modest growth in Asia and emerging markets where it is limiting its potential audience. But, no doubt, Netflix is already eying long-term solutions to fulfill its potential worldwide.
As the company said in a letter to its shareholders: “Disrupting a big market can be bumpy, but the opportunity ahead is as big as ever and we continue to improve every aspect of our business.”",2016-07-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/netflix.jpg?w=738,"media-streaming,streaming,ott",Netflix’s overseas problem: still too expensive and still not enough content
648,Jon Russell,"Lookup, an India-based chat service that connects consumers to local business and is backed by some notable U.S. investors, has been acquired by business discovery service NowFloats, which is also based in India. The undisclosed deal is a mixture of cash and stock, and Lookup said it will continue to operate independently.
We first wrote about Lookup last year when it raised $2.5 million in funding from a range of top investors, including Vinod Khosla’s personal fund Khosla Impact, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, Narayana Murthy’s Catamaran Ventures and Global Founders Capital, the investment fund from the Samwer brothers behind Rocket Internet.
The company is focused on tapping the explosion of messaging and mobile internet to bring the long-tail of local retailers online. Many people already use WhatsApp to connect with local retailers they know, and Lookup sought to formalize this in India — the largest WhatsApp country on the planet — by building a directory to let you connect with stores via chat.

Lookup claims 90,000 businesses on its platform and some 1.2 million users. Ultimately though, CEO and founder Deepak Ravindran told me that it was most logical to find a partner than continue to plod along alone for two big reasons.
Firstly, there’s been a major shift away from hyper local services in India. Well-funded startups like PepperTap, Grofers and TinyOwl have this year scaled back on ambitious expansion plans and pivoted as VCs showed a reluctance to continue to fund business with high cash burn and a long window to profitability.
Second, Ravindran said also that WhatsApp’s announcement of plans to introduce business accounts sometime in the future added another challenge.
“We attracted investment [last year], but this year turned out to be tougher for hyper local companies,” he told me over the phone. “What would be right strategy? It takes a look of time to build a network. If traditional VCs are not interested in the game, we wanted to find strong partner to give us the independence to grow on the right track.”
NowFloats is a platform for local businesses in India. It claims to have over 250,000 participating retailer partners and, having been focused on the desktop web, it sees Lookup and its mobile focus as wholly complimentary. Likewise, with discovery on NowFloats centered around search, CEO Jasminder Singh Gulati is keen to embrace chat as a medium.
“Over the past year, NowFloats has conducted three research sprints across India (that includes driving across the country and meeting people), and it was clear that chat is one of the most pervasive behaviors’ followed by search and apps,” he wrote in a blog post.
The two companies will remain separate but Ravindran said there are obvious areas where they can work together, for example on retail partners and users. He’s aiming to develop Lookup so that chat accounts for 10-15 percent of NowFloats’ traffic — it is currently at around two percent, he said.
It seems like we can expect more consolidation like this in India this year with investors tightening belts. That’s for the lucky companies though, those who can’t find the right partner might be forced to close down altogether.",2016-07-18,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/lookup-nowfloats.jpeg?w=738,"chat-commerce,social-commerce,lookup",Khosla-backed Lookup acquired by business discovery service NowFloats
649,Jon Russell,"aCommerce, a Bangkok-based startup that helps e-commerce companies in Southeast Asia run their businesses, has landed $10 million in new funding ahead of a planned Series B raise later this year.
The company, which is currently active in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, said this latest raise is led by MDI Ventures — a fund associated with mobile operator Telkom Indonesia — with participation from Australia-based fund Blue Sky and existing backer DKSH. Switzerland-based market expansion firm DKSH made an undisclosed strategic investment in aCommerce in December, which TechCrunch understands was worth between $20-$25 million.
E-commerce is showing some serious potential in Southeast Asia, as evidenced by Alibaba’s $1 billion investment in Lazada earlier this year. aCommerce plays the role of enabler, helping e-commerce companies, brands and traditional retailers manage their online business through a range of services that cover inventories, warehousing, logistics, fulfilment and digital marketing. The company was founded in 2013 and has now raised closed to $50 million from investors, including a $10.7 million Series A in June 2014 and a $5 million bridge round last May, alongside today’s reveal and the DKSH injection.
Like the previous bridge round, this new raise is designed to help the company “sprint” before a larger round in excess of $50 million later this year. In other words, aCommerce said it still has money in the bank but wants to spend to grow to secure a more favorable raise. Specifically, it plans to expand its business to Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore.
“We want to get maximum valuation with minimal dilution,” aCommerce Group CEO Paul Srivorakul told TechCrunch in an interview. “Instead of raising Series B [now], we’ve gone back to investors to raise more capital before a Series B at end of the year.”
(By the way, raising a Series B after already banking $50 million is certainly not the norm for Southeast Asia, and Srivorakul admitted that he doesn’t put a tag on the company’s funding efforts. “For us, we’re just raising it at our convenience,” he said.)
Srivorakul, who previously founded and exited group buying site Ensogo to LivingSocial and AdMax to online ad firm Komli, said there had been discussions with investors prior to the company’s last round, so this new investment was already possible. For the Series B, though, he plans to pitch to look to new sources of capital.
Talking up his new backers, Srivorakul said that MDI Ventures could be hugely strategic in Indonesia, which recently overtook Thailand as the startup’s largest revenue generator.
“Their demand generation is massive,” he explained. “On the other side, customs and e-commerce laws are getting very complicated, these guys are the tech arm of the government so [we] find it exciting to build products around customs in Indonesia and keep building out our Indonesia play.”
aCommerce expansion to Singapore will see it reenter the country having previously quit in 2014. Admitting that first entry was a little too early, Srivorakul argued that aCommerce is coming back with a “partner” — DKSH, which he said is helping onboard new clients from its roster — and demand from existing customers in other markets, which can make a difference this time.
He noted also that he is observing a much greater focus on sustainability when it comes to scaling emerging market startups. On those lines, he said he is confident that aCommerce could sustain itself in the wake of any kind of funding crunch or downturn.
“We can break even next year with the money we have now,” he told TechCrunch. “We can manage these [existing three] markets to profitability, but we need to capture three more markets [and] that’s where we’re looking to deploy this [new] capital.”",2016-07-18,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/2.jpg?w=738,"mdi-ventures,southeast-asia,acommerce",Southeast Asia’s aCommerce raises $10M to prepare for Series B
650,Jon Russell,"Baidu has made its second investment in a U.S. fintech company inside a month after it put an undisclosed sum of money into ZestFinance, a big data firm specializing in credit scoring. Baidu, which operates China’s dominant search platform, took part in a $60 million round for payments firm Circle in June.
The deal is part of an agreement that will see Baidu use ZestFinance’s technology to develop a credit scoring platform based on its search data. That’s important in a market like China where traditional credit systems are broken. There’s precious little formalized credit history data while many people don’t use banks heavily or are unbanked. With the internet becoming mainstream in China, which has the largest ‘web population’ on the planet, new opportunities to vet and verify potential customers for credit have emerged.
“China interests me from a mission perspective,” ZestFinance founder and CEO Douglas Merrill told me in a phone interview. “There are a lot of people who deserve credit but live in a cash economy [with] no formal banking service to serve them.”
“ZestFinance’s unique ability to analyze and process complex, disparate data to make accurate credit decisions is very valuable to the Chinese credit market, where a centralized credit scoring system has yet to emerge,” added Tony Yip, global head of investment, mergers and acquisitions at Baidu, said via a statement.
“We look forward to working together to help transform the financial services market in China,” Yip added.
ZestFinance was founded by ex-Google CIO and VP of engineering Merrill, and it uses machine learning and big data to transform information into measurements and signals for credit scoring. It has raised nearly $100 million from investors, with its most recent raise a $20 million Series C round in July 2013. JD.com also put money in as part of its strategic partnership last summer.
Today’s news is latest in a number of moves from China’s top internet companies in their quest to narrow the country’s banking divide. Alibaba and Tencent both operate digital banks and micro-loan programs, while Baidu stepped into the banking ring via a partnership with brick and mortar bank CITIC. ZestFinance previously partnered with JD.com, Alibaba’s closest rival in China’s e-commerce space, to power the credit service run by its financial arm, which is valued at more than $1 billion. Then there are multi-billion dollar payment services like Alipay (Alibaba) and WeChat Pay (Tencent), too.
A number of fintech startups are stepping up in Asia to offer a modern take on credit scoring using the internet and social media — we recently profiled FinAccel in Southeast Asia — but Merrill told me that this is the first time search data has been used to power credit scoring. That’s something very unique to China, he explained, because Baidu’s search engine has around 80 percent marketshare and is a willing partner. Replicating the service outside of China would be interesting, he added, but challenging to set up.
“Ultimately, you need access to data that can be turned into credit data,” he said.
That would mean Google, if you look at search, which would be more likely to develop its own technology in that space, if it was interested at all. Then there is the issue of disparate languages.
ZestFinance has now secured two partnerships in China, but Merrill said he is happiest to produce the means for large firms to make a difference rather than head into China directly.
“We find China fascinating, we feel like we can help do something to help the world,” he added.",2016-07-17,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_9811.jpg?w=738,"china,credit-scoring,zestfinance,baidu",Baidu invests in ZestFinance to develop search-powered credit scoring for China
651,Jon Russell,"Fresh from a positive listing in New York on Thursday, messaging company Line saw its share price jump as high as 50 percent after it listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in its native Japan. In total, the company raised over $1.1 billion from the dual listing, which makes it the biggest tech IPO of 2016 to date.
The company opened at $42 on the NYSE, up 33 percent on its list pricing, and it closed the day at $41.58. Its share price in Japan, which is its largest market and responsible for 90 percent of revenue, jumped to 5,000 JPY from an opening price of 3,300 JPY before settling to around 4,405 JPY at the time of writing.
I wrote a fairly lengthy explainer on the company, its strengths and challenges yesterday, but the success of its listing has been remarkable given that the company hasn’t shown much sign of growth lately.
Line has 218 million monthly active users, two-thirds of which are in Japan, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia, but it only added 13 million to that figure over the last year. That’s around six percent growth.
Revenue-wise, it blasted past $1 billion for the first time in 2015, but posted a loss of $76 million for the year. Last year, it had its first quarter without growth and its income of $298 million for the first quarter of 2016 — while impressive for a messaging app — isn’t a big increase in runrate on its sales for 2015.
Nonetheless, investors seem bullish.

652,Jon Russell,"Rentomojo, a startup pioneering an interesting alternative for furnishing homes in India, has landed $5 million in fresh financing to further scale its business. The money was provided by Accel and IDG Ventures, and it follows a $2 million raise last November from the same investors.
The 18-month-old company’s thesis is simple: it doesn’t make sense for most people in India to buy furniture and appliances for their place of residence. Instead, Rentomojo wants to free people from the burden and cost of ownership but letting them rent what they need instead.
Renting isn’t commonplace for home items, but the benefits — lack of commitment and cheaper prices — feed into trends that are accentuated in India, Geetansh Bamania, CEO and founder of RentoMojo, told me in an interview.
Indian workers, he explained, have, on average, a low disposable income (6,000-7,000 INR or around $105) which makes stumping up for expensive items tricky. They are also likely to move cities regularly, he argued that typically an average young worker moves location every two or three years. That makes owning physical assets impractical since you either cart them around with you, or are forced to go through the pain of selling them second-hand before you move.
Using Rentomojo, a consumer simply returns the asset and completes any remaining rental contract that they had agreed. The average contract for payments is eight months in duration, and Bamania said that typical customer is paying $30 per month for their item/items.
Rentomojo claims to have 10,000 active customers right now across six cities in India. Bamania is aiming to reach 10 million rental apartments to date within the next year. (In other words, to have placed items in a cumulative 10 million homes.)
Beyond the problem that Rentomojo is looking to solve, the most interesting part of the company is arguably the way it manages the potentially capital intensive process of ensuring supply. Bamania said the company initially procured and kept its own stock, but then he had a mind-shifting thought, why not treat the assets like an investment?
Turning the model on its head, Rentomojo began working with banks for asset financing. So financiers essentially pay to buy the assets, and then take a cut of the rental returns that each one makes. Bamania suggested that, typically, every $100 of input yields $10 in revenue per month, although a (undisclosed) portion of that is passed over to banks, with Rentomojo making its revenue from that, too.
“Renting as subscription model was capital intensive, we turned capex into opex and built a financial tech model,” Bamania explained. “It’s a win-win for those who own the asset and those who use it, too.”
He added that the new capital will be used to strengthen the company’s tech platform — which manages the asset finances and physical location — and grow its team of 160, most of whom are in the field.
“The industry doesn’t require that much capital didn’t want to raise what we didn’t need,” Bamania explained.
On the subject of financials, he said that the company is “unit economic positive” — in other words: not losing money on transactions — and that it wants to reach a $12 million annual run rate “very soon.” Right now, he said, the business is at around $3 million in annual run rate. That applies to review across its platform and it includes the money paid out to partners.
“The biggest hinderance [we face] is awareness,” he added of the challenges. “When a disruption needs to happen, awareness needs to be created. Subscriptions will displace commerce and take over the buying concept in time.”",2016-07-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/shutterstock_403797079.jpg?w=738,"india,idg-ventures,accel,rentomojo","India’s Rentomojo, which rents out home appliances and furniture, raises $5M"
653,Jon Russell,"SirionLabs, an India-headquartered company that uses tech to help companies manage their contracts and relationships with suppliers, has completed a $12.25 million Series B round. The round, which takes SirionLabs to $16 million raised, was led by Sequoia India with participation from QualGro ASEAN Fund and Canopy Ventures.
The Gurugram-based startup typically works with large multinational companies to help them manage relationships with their suppliers. Its platform integrates with in-house systems to analyze supplier contracts to help with auditing, tracking KPIs and goals, and more. Some of its most recognizable clients include BP, Western Union and Vodafone, while it works with top consulting firms, too.
Ajay Agrawal, SirionLabs’ CEO, told me over the phone that large corporations are beginning to look to specialized services to help manage their outsourcing, but it is still a nascent space.
“We’re moving from a world that consumes goods and commodities to a world that consumes services,” he said in an interview. “Traditional procurement technology doesn’t cut the ice, managing the vendor after signature is the order of the day.”
Agrawal said he estimates that more than $1.1 trillion is spent annually on outsourcing, yet most of that is unmonitored and not audited acutely.
Big companies typically wait for the supplier to submit the invoice, and along with the invoice they provide backup data and assertions that they have complied with the terms agreed. He sees that some companies have started to independently audit and are in “the vanguard of breaking free but overwhelmed by sheer volume of data to really intelligently.”
That’s where SirionLabs wants to make a meaningful difference with its services, which it charges companies to use via a per seat model.
“What you want to know as a buyer or a supplier around a complex contract is what the obligations and deliverables embedded in a contract are. [To] get that list with as little manual intervention is really the goal… [it’s] ongoing process, today we have automated it to around mid-50 percent of the manual labor,” Agrawal explained.
The aim is really increased transparency, which is why — Agrawal claimed — service providers are keen to embrace platforms like this so that they can clearly show their customers that they have hit their mark. Indeed, the SirionLabs has since developed a ‘revenue assurance’ product that does just that.
The majority of SirionLabs’ 150 staff are based in India, but it has sales teams across the U.S., Europe (London) and Singapore. With this new capital, Agrawal said that SirionLabs will beef up its sales team and work on R&D and product development. With regards to hiring, he said that the company is looking for talent based in Silicon Valley who are open to relocating back to India.
On a related note: Sanish Mondkar, who is a former executive vice president and chief product officer at SAP, has joined SirionLabs’ Board of Directors. Mondkar helped build products for Ariba, the company which SAP acquired for $4.3 billion in 2012, and SirionLabs said he will “work closely” with its product and engineering teams.",2016-07-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/money-cash-money-cash.jpg?w=738,"sirionlabs,outsourcing,ajay-agrawal,sequoia",SirionLabs raises $12.25M to help big firms get smarter with their suppliers
654,Piyush Khaitan,"

India’s digital landscape is changing faster than we can imagine, and it could mean huge improvements in financial access for many. As we speak, three key factors are converging to create a new, more robust digital ecosystem in India, permanently changing the way we do business.
The proliferation of smartphones, a government initiative and a new payments interface are changing the market, driving the rise of mobile wallets and garnering attention from major brands like Apple. For those among the approximately 233 million unbanked in India, this could be a huge step toward full financial inclusion — allowing them to save, borrow, build credit, make payments, purchase insurance and build better lives.
The first component of this digital ecosystem is smartphone proliferation. In February, India passed the U.S. to become the second-largest smartphone market in the world (behind China). There are more than 1 billion mobile phone connections in the country, and 250 million of those are smartphones. Smartphone sales continue to rise, making up a larger percentage of total phone sales. Suddenly, a very intelligent device is getting into the hands of many Indians, which is bound to change the way we reach people, even across once-insurmountable distances.
The second is the Aadhaar profile, a 12-digit unique identification number available to all Indians. As impressive and useful as smartphones are for connecting people to the internet and formal financial services, that connectivity means nothing without first having identification. Started in 2009 by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the government agency has issued more than 1 billion Aadhaar numbers so far, which amounts to more than 80 percent of the population.
This sweeping new program gives many Indians something they’ve never had before: government-issued, formal identification. This is no small matter — MasterCard CEO Ajay Banga recently said that “not having an identity is effectively like being in prison. Everybody is going around with their hair on fire about the Internet. If you don’t have an account, it will be the Internet of everything, but not the Internet of everyone.” And to get an account, you first need to prove you are who you say you are.
The voluntary identification system makes that easier; it links a unique 12-digit number to basic demographic information and biometric data, such as fingerprints and iris scans, all of which are stored in a central database.
The proliferation of Aadhaar numbers lowers several barriers to financial access. Indians can now link bank accounts to their Aadhaar number, and the Aadhaar card is a valid ID for purchasing a SIM card, opening a bank account or accessing government services like a pension or subsidized ration. Aadhaar can help India’s new smartphone-driven connectivity reach its potential — and matter to the hundreds of millions of people living without formal financial services.
Finally, there is the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Unified Payment Interface (UPI), which allows money to move between two Aadhaar profiles via a smartphone. For the first time, the UPI makes it possible for Indians to do a huge number of transactions that are not only cashless, but branchless. The cost is down to less than one rupee per transaction, which is the equivalent of about one penny. Ten major banks are already incorporating the interface into their mobile apps, and RBI is hopeful that more will join them. For rural Indians, the ability to conduct business via smartphone makes them less reliant on bank branches or kiosks, improving their practical access to financial services.
The confluence of these three factors, alongside efforts to improve financial literacy and the increasing availability of mobile wallets, payment banks and small banks, has the potential to create a flourishing digital ecosystem with an immense amount of available data. This will be game-changing for businesses like NeoGrowth, which makes it our mission to leverage these new data sources to revolutionize lending for Indian small businesses. A competitive market of cashless financial services is good news for the future of financial inclusion in mobile-savvy India.",2016-07-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/shutterstock_208937962.jpg?w=738,"smartphone-adoption,banking,india",Opening the gates on Indian financial data
655,Jon Russell,"Paktor, a dating app that rivals Tinder in Southeast Asia, is pushing itself into more global markets. The Singapore-based startup just swiped right on $10 million in fresh capital after raising a round of funding to expand into Japan and South Korea as part of a wider global push.
YJ Capital — the corporate venture firm belonging to Yahoo Capital — led the round, which included participation from fellow new investors Global Grand Leisure, Golden Equator Capital and Sebrina Holdings, as well as existing backers Vertex Ventures (which belongs to Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek) MNC Media Group, Majuven and Convergence Ventures.
Paktor has now raised more than $22 million to date, including a $7.4 million Series B round one year ago, which it has used to expand beyond its initial, Tinder-like dating app to cover offline events and services, such as group travel, speed dating and more. It also has expanded its geographies beyond an initial focus on Southeast Asia’s six largest countries: Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.
The move into South Korea and Japan will be aided by YJ Capital, which maintains strong links with Yahoo Japan — the joint entity from SoftBank and Yahoo which is the country’s largest web portal and media company and worth upwards of $8.5 billion. But that’s not Paktor’s only expansion effort.
It hired two former executives at IAC, the firm that owns Match.com, Tinder and others, to oversee its international expansion outside of Asia. Jose Ruano and Miguel Mangas, formerly with IAC’s Meetic in Spain, are CEO and VP of marketing, respectively, for Paktor International and in charge of globalizing the company. That comes in the form of M&A deals and media partnerships.
So far, Paktor acquired South America-based Kickoff for an undisclosed sum in May. Joseph Phua, Paktor CEO and co-founder who started the company in 2013 with two friends, said that Paktor is close to closing two further acquisitions — one in Europe and another in Asia; he isn’t saying more than that, for now — while it has partnered with media companies in other countries, which essentially take its backend tech and provide a visible brand and distribution platform to extend Paktor’s reach into other markets.
Interestingly, China and India aren’t immediately in those plans.
“We concluded with certainly [that] we don’t know [about India and China] and have concluded with certainty that we don’t want to tackle uncertainty right now,” Phua said somewhat cryptically. [India, for what it is worth, is the base for Tinder’s first international office — and the company said it has potential to be one of its largest markets worldwide.]
All in all, Paktor’s Phua said that when these acquisitions close over the next two months, they will give his company and its (soon to be three) acquired entities a total footprint of 15 million registered users. Speaking to me in October last year, Phua said Paktor had around six million registered users in its core Southeast Asia base, but the company is not providing an update on that figure right now.
Phua did say, however, that Paktor has instituted a range of new engagement features that — he claimed — have boosted average daily user activity from 160 swipes per day to 200, from 30 minutes of activity per day to 40 minutes and a 200 percent boost in active chats, that is, conversations of three or more exchanges between users who have matched on the service.
Paktor is also targeting at least $10 million in revenue for this year after it decided to offer a new model for emerging markets, like Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. In those places, and other emerging markets, it is breaking down its subscription model into smaller, more affordable options for more cash-conscious users.
“We raised this round because we saw an opportunity outside of our existing markets… [it’s] a strategic round to help us,” Phua told me in a phone interview. “We’re thinking that a year or two years down the road, investors want to know your long-term plan.”
“Our next immediate step to bulk up on operational assets and [push the] revenue. Post-12 months, the next step would be clearer: [a potential] merger [acquisition target] or further consolidation — right now it is anyone’s guess,” he added.
“Right now, we are taking some side bets; we get opportunities because our brand is strong [but] if we take on our side bets, then an exit isn’t [in that] 12-18 month time frame.”",2016-07-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0152.jpg?w=738,"global-grand-leisure,yj-capital,paktor",Asian Tinder rival Paktor lands $10M to further global push with launches in Japan and South Korea
656,Lora Kolodny,"Looking in the mirror or stepping on a scale can tell us much about our bodies and wellbeing, but not with the greatest precision.
Now, a Sydney, Australia-based company called mPort is bringing its mPod body scanners to gyms and malls in the U.S., where they think users will be interested in getting granular data about their bodies.
The mPod, which looks like a large photo booth or a small, modular changing room, requires users to step inside, lock the door and strip down to their underwear for a full body scan with infrared sensors.
A basic scan is free and use of the mPods is unlimited. Premium users who pay $5 a month or $40 per year can get a much more detailed report from each scan via the company’s apps.
A single, 7-second scan in an mPod creates a detailed avatar that a user can examine from all angles along with some basic data including height, weight and body mass index.
A premium scan gives users a comparison of body scans over time, and details like body fat composition, hip to waist ratio, and many other measurements that indicate physical fitness or a lack of it.
All together, mPort CEO Dipra Ray said the mPod gathers 200,000 data points about a user’s body to construct a scan and measurements displayed in the app.
People like the mPods, Ray said, because “It’s like a changing room experience. It’s private and comfortable.” That experience compares to going to a personal fitness trainer who may use everything from scales and measuring tapes to calipers to generate a similar report.
The mPod app lets users see whether or how their bodies are changing over time as they try different approaches to fitness.
MPods are already installed in shopping centers and gyms in Australia, where 85,000 people have already gotten scanned, Ray said.
But mPort now has a new deal to distribute and maintain its mPods at L.A. Fitness gyms across the U.S.
The company competes with hardware makers such as Fit3D, which sells its professional body scanners to fitness trainers, and Naked Labs which makes a 3-D body scanning mirror for home use.
Besides giving users data that could influence their dietary choices and fitness routines, Ray said the mPods are gathering data that could prove incredibly useful in helping users shop for custom-tailored clothing online, or just avoid ordering items they later need to return due to improper fit.",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/la_fitness_mpod.jpg?w=738,"health-and-wellness,fitness",The mPod is a 3-D body scanner coming to a gym near you
657,Haje Jan Kamps,"Pullstring — née ToyTalk — today launched its eponymous product out of private beta and into the hands of creators of conversational interfaces everywhere. Out of the box, creators can make bots for Facebook Messenger, Slack, Skype, Kik, Telegram and — using the company’s Web API — pretty much every other platform out there.
The company’s authoring tools are presented as a desktop software package that will be available for the Mac OS X platform today and for Windows “coming soon.”
“This weekend, one of the best examples of chatbots we’ve seen so far launched as part of Channel 4’s Humans TV show,” says Oren Jacob, CEO at Pullstring. “It was going gangbusters, and is seeing a huge amount of engagement.”
Eager to check out the quality of the bot, I dove into the world of Persona Synthetics and am embarrassed to say that the time I was meant to be writing this article, I was instead having an intriguing conversation with a chatbot (try it out, it’s pretty awesome). Don’t get me wrong, the bot wouldn’t pass the Turing test, but trying to do so is a different field of computing, Jacob claims.
“I’ve often said that the characters are better defined by the things they can’t talk about, rather than what they know about,” Jacob complains. He draws the comparison that when you’re ordering a pizza from a pizza restaurant, you could start talking about hamburgers. A human operator would get exasperated, reminding you they’re a pizza restaurant. It makes sense for a bot to do the same. “What happens when a conversation drifts off topic is important. With Pullstring, we have created bots with a huge range. When you are talking with your bank about financial issues, for example, we have to keep the conversation tight and to the point. At the other extreme is our Hello Barbie product, where kids can talk about almost anything.”

The newly launched Pullstring, then, is the set of tools to help developers and content creators create compelling bots and conversational interfaces as quickly as possible. Most compellingly, perhaps, is that the interactions are self-learning. By using a combination of simple rules and a machine-learning AI, the bot can have conversations that are genuine and useful. Not only that, but machine learning can help having context-appropriate conversations.
“We worked with Activision Blizzard to help create a bot for Lt. Reyes, one of the characters in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,” Jacob tells me in an effort to explain the lengths the technology can go to in order to create an authentic vibe. “To get a genuine feel to the conversations, we pointed our AI at a large Call of Duty subreddit. We learned from the language used there to figure out how the gamers communicate together. As a result, the bot speaks in a similar way as the gamers would. We matched the tone and created a very credible experience.”
I haven’t played multiplayer games in a while, but one can only assume that the phrases “pwned” and various slurs were filtered out of the discourse. It worked great, though: Within the first 24 hours, more than 6 million chats were exchanged over Facebook Messenger, and the fans are eagerly awaiting the game’s launch in November.
Rules-based conversations are a great way to push a conversational product live; it is the bare bones of the experience. However, as millions of customers start having conversations, it becomes possible to learn from these interactions.
Pullstring’s platform includes metrics tools to help analyze how the conversational interface is performing. In addition to the obvious parts, such as warning the bot’s creators where in the conversations customers are getting stuck, there are ways of optimizing the conversations toward particular goals or outcomes.
The platform’s superpower, however, is that it remains context-aware across longer conversations, so a conversation you’re having with a customer is less likely to disappear into the weeds.
Gaming was an early adopter of Pullstring’s tech, including the company’s own Facebook Messenger and Skype game Humani, and a number of games aimed at younger children under the company’s ToyTalk brand. It would be a mistake to think this is all about entertainment, however.
“We have the ambition to create human-fidelity conversations,” explains Jacob. “We started in entertainment, but that’s not what this technology is primarily for. Our customers are constructing interactions in health, commerce, and much more.”

“Conversations are more than he-said-she-said,” Jacob says. “Much more. When you listen to a real conversation between two humans, there are a huge number of variables. A conversation is initiated with an intent: Someone wants to accomplish something. The content is important, too, of course. Together, they create a conversation.”
In addition to the actual words being said, the company goes deep into linguistics to simulate true conversations. Most importantly, then, there is the language-level interaction. A real conversation isn’t that person A finishes what they say, and person B listens carefully before giving a considered answer. It’s a game of back-and-forth, of interjections, queries, prompts and suggestions. This is ultimately what Pullstring is trying to help facilitate when you are having a conversation with your pizza parlor, your hairdresser or, potentially, the automated meter-maid that ticketed your car. Again.
With today’s launch, Pullstring offers both a DIY solution, where those wanting to author conversational interfaces can get started, or more managed, agency-style options.
“We have tutorials, sample code and sample e-commerce solutions,” says Lucas Ives, head of conversation engineering at Pullstring. He says that over the past five years of Pullstring, the company has learned more about getting computers to pose as human conversations than anyone else and that it is eager to maximize the knowledge transfer to its customers “There’s videos you can watch, a huge library of documentation and our support team is here to help, too.”
For larger accounts, the company continues to offer its agency model, where the company’s writers and content creators can work with in-house teams to create bots.
Pullstring’s authoring tools are available to everyone, starting today, and the company has an overview of its main features on the site.",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/humani.png?w=738,"oren-jacob,conversational-interface,conversational-commerce,pullstring",Pullstring launches bot-authoring tools for fun & profit
658,Natasha Lomas,"Spanish startup Red Points has closed a €2 million (~$2.2M) funding round to grow usage of its piracy detection and removal SaaS by expanding from Europe into new markets, including North America. It’s also intending to broaden its customer focus.
Its system is also designed to detect counterfeit goods being sold online, such as sportswear and designer handbags, automating the sending of cease and desist requests to speed up the process of removing fake goods from sale.
Red Points describes the funding round, which is coming from Mangrove Capital Partners, as a Series A, although it skipped taking in a seed round.
Commenting on the funding in a statement, Mangrove partner David Waroquier, lauded its “robust technology” and “impressive team”.
“Red Points has the potential to disrupt the way piracy and counterfeiting are being detected and resolved over the internet,” he added, dubbing it “a highly efficient solution to manage what has become a huge and persistent pain for the industry globally”.
The startup, which was founded by a lawyer, Josep Coll, back in 2011, has built tech that continuously crawls known piracy hotspots and counterfeit goods outlets online on behalf of its clients to identify possible infringements.
In the fake products scenario, clients are sent a report with a probability score for suspect items so they can confirm it is indeed a counterfeit goods sale — at which point RedPoints’ system then pursues extrajudicial actions. It also does this in the case of copyright infringement. Automated actions can include sending a notification of infringement, and/or communicating with relevant ISPs and search engines to secure the de-indexing of relevant web pages.
CEO Laura Urquizu claims Red Points is able to get a piece of copyrighted content removed as quickly as two hours after detection using its in-house take down tools. Physical counterfeit goods typically taken longer to remove from online sale — perhaps a day, she says.
It says it currently deletes more than 52,000 incidents of illegal content every month for its media, publisher and brand clients. “We focused from the beginning in having an excellent system of removal,” she adds.
Brands it is working with currently include Next and Conde Nast International. It also works with athletes, film stars and music artists. It has around 75 customers at this stage, according to Urquizu.
“Right now we are doing it for very big brands but we want to do it for any kind of size of company that has this problem — of counterfeiting. Because we realize that not only the big brands have this problem… So we want to go to the new markets,” she tells TechCrunch.
While it can’t act against actual P2P file sharing, since file sharing between individuals is not illegal, Urquizu says it does crawl P2P networks to try to identify when a full movie (for instance) is uploaded initially to be torrented — and get it taken down then, before the P2P sharing can commence.
“Piracy and content faking always happens in the same places,” she says, explaining how the detection tech works. “There are certain places where it always happens. So the 90 per cent of the searching goes to there. We have specific crawlers and scrapers for those places that show the fake information.”
“In the case of products the client has to validate that its fake — we never do anything without the validation of the client,” she adds.
How does it pick up counterfeit goods being sold online? That’s down to the detailed information provided by the client, which can include things like the characteristics of the genuine article, its price and the outlets where it can be legally sold.
Design verticals are the big focus here — covering anything from furniture to dresses, shoes, glasses and so on.
“Pricing is very important. If a genuine product is being sold for €200 and if they’re selling to you for €100 or €75 that’s probably fake,” Urquizu notes. “The brand provides us with a lot of information — everything under this price is fake. They also give us the correct facts — the legal places where the products have been sold in the Internet.”
Although detecting counterfeit goods is a more recent addition (a year ago) to Red Points’ system, Urquizu says it’s already making up about half its business (with copyright actions the other half) so she says it expects this to be a big growth area.
As well as expanding into new markets globally and widening its customer base by ramping up its sales team Red points will be using the funding for continued development of its core tech.
“Piracy and counterfeiting is always evolving. We have to adapt and improve continuously the technology,” she adds.",2016-09-27,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-27-at-12-43-04-pm.png?w=738,"piracy,counterfeiting,copyright-infringement,software-as-a-service",Red Points bags $2.2M to help brands fight counterfeiting and piracy
659,Josh Rochlin,"

I have used my free time this summer revisiting a childhood passion: fishing. My father loved to fish. He would take me to Central Park’s Ramble and Lake with a hook and lure. I would inevitably catch something very small, put it in a cup and hope it would survive overnight to show my friends.
As I grew older, we graduated to fishing boats launching from City Island and Sheepshead Bay. My yield was a bit bigger, but most fish failed to meet the required size. The “keepers” were the prize; we brought them home for Sunday dinner. Too often on Sundays, we ordered pizza instead.
These fishing trips came to mind recently on a farewell call with Steve (maybe not his real name), a former IBM colleague. When IBM acquired our company three years ago, the value was more than just Xtify’s mobile engagement platform — the “keepers” were my senior management team.
Each of these executives were destined to become stars at Big Blue. They had successfully helped pioneer an industry (mobile CRM) and met the challenges of persuading large enterprises to adopt a new engagement channel (push notifications). They were creative and passionate innovators. This particular IBM sales executive was calling to ask how he could recruit talented leaders similar to the ones I brought to IBM. He was essentially asking where he could find the keepers.
It’s not that IBM doesn’t have keepers; it does. But notwithstanding the taxonomy, it’s very hard for a large company to find and keep the keepers. And that’s when I told him about fishing in the dead pool.
If IBM, or any company, is looking for talent that can inject passion, creativity and energy into their efforts, the dead pool of startups is a fertile (and well-stocked) pond from which to fish.
In fact, IBM has a history of success fishing in these waters. The executive who built its content and search business came from the pool, as did the strategic team now growing IBM’s cloud offerings.
The Xtify team succeeded with equal parts talent, hard work and luck. Our timing was fortuitous. We matured in the mobile space just when everyone was talking “MobileFirst,” and we grasped the significance of SaaS apps for the CMO just as the market was shifting toward cloud-based offerings. We had the right story at the right time, and a receptive and acquisitive audience in IBM.
But it didn’t have to work out that way. And if it hadn’t, Michael, Gil, Josh and Dan (maybe not their real names) would have been no less keepers. They would just have been keepers floundering in the dead pool.

This is Steve’s time to go fishing. The challenge is to set his lure just right and cast his rod in the dead pool.",2016-09-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-135975505.jpg?w=738,"failed-startups,talent-acquisition,deadpool",Fishing in the dead pool
660,Romain Dillet,"French startup Zenly has raised $22.5 million over the summer from Benchmark and a few other investors. Business Insider first reported the round and TechCrunch got an official confirmation. Here’s what we know.
Benchmark is leading the round with Peter Fenton joining the board of the company. Fenton has invested in a few social network companies and also is a board member of Twitter. Existing investors Idinvest and Xavier Niel also put a bit more money into this round. Insight Venture Partners co-founder Jerry Murdock also invested personally.
More interestingly, Benchmark invested directly into the French company. This is significant, as many American VCs prefer to invest in an American company, even if it means that French startups have to do a costly relocation. Benchmark didn’t want to waste time.
Zenly managed to raise this round in just 28 days from intro to money in the bank account — it was a quick one. The company had raised an $11.2 million Series A round last year (€10 million) and still had plenty of money in the bank. But it’s hard to say no to Benchmark.
“Being able to see where your friends are and who they are with opens up a world of product opportunities, which if executed successfully will lead to one of the iconic companies of our lifetime,” Fenton said. “We were immediately won over by the Zenly team’s depth of technical expertise and their vision for the map as a basis for a whole array of social engagement.”
In case you missed the first episode, I already wrote a lengthy profile about Zenly, a promising location-sharing app. This isn’t yet another check-in app, this isn’t just a “Find my Friends”-type app. It goes further than that.
Zenly wants to make location sharing cool again. The company spent a lot of time getting the basics right. In its current state, Zenly is an easy way to share your current location with a handful of friends… or dozens of them.
It turns out that teens loved it — 2 million people have downloaded the app so far. And it’s just the beginning, as Zenly will add layers of useful data on top of this basic premise.
For instance, what if you could get a notification when your friends are hanging out together so that you don’t miss out on a great party? Similarly, Zenly knows before many other apps that a place is trending because it knows when people actually go to this place.
It’s going to be a long road, as Zenly is playing in an incredibly competitive industry. Tech companies like Google, Apple and Uber have been hard at work to build the best map you can use. As Zenly wants to go beyond putting pins on a map, the company will have to build its own mapping data.
Zenly has 35 employees right now, and plans to open an office in San Francisco over the coming weeks. The company plans to keep most of the engineering team in France and operate with two offices. And now, the startup has a lot of money to worry less about money and more about the product.",2016-09-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/zenly-1.jpg?w=738,"peter-fenton,benchmark,france-newsletter,zenly",Zenly raises $22.5 million from Benchmark for its location-sharing app

662,Anthony Ha,"Inverse, a new-ish digital media startup founded by Bleacher Report’s Dave Nemetz, is announcing that it has raised $6 million in Series A funding.
The Inverse site launched in August 2015 and covers a mix of science, technology and entertainment news — as I write this, the front page features stories on astrobiology, future cities and The Simpsons. Nemetz told me the goal is to cover the interests of millennial men, but not in an obnoxious way.
“We think of ourselves as a male-oriented site in that our audience is heavily male, but we don’t outwardly cater to men on the site — if you look at our about page, it’s not like it’s the site for dudes,” he said. “We’re kind of proving that you don’t have to write really bro-y, dumbed down content, you don’t have to just write about sports to reach guys.”
Many of these topics are covered elsewhere (including on TechCrunch), but Nemetz said he’s not trying to imitate “the real kind of geeky, nerdy fanboy sites.” As he explained, “I have nothing against those either, but we’re not trying to be a site for nerds, but [instead a site] where all types of guys go to.”
Nemetz is best-known as one of the founders of Bleacher Report, the sports news site acquired by Time Warner’s Turner Sports division for $170 million. (One of his co-founders, Bryan Goldberg, went on to start female-focused news site Bustle.) At Inverse, he said he’s trying to “borrow from the best of both worlds,” with a strong editorial team that’s supported by tech tools and analytics.
The site says its audience grew to 7 million unique visitors in August — more than 80 percent of the audience is male, and 75 percent are between 18 and 34 years old.
The Series A funding was led by Crosslink Capital, with participation from Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments, Social Starts, Bialla Venture Partners and Vast Ventures. Inverse has now raised nearly $8 million in total funding.

“We see an opportunity to build a really big business in this space, with new distribution models and the way that more money is continuing to shift from traditional advertising into digital advertising,” he said. “But in order to be successful, you have to be good at a lot of things — in editorial, you need a really strong voice, you need to be good at building a brand, at building an audience, you need to be good at advertising. There’s only so many teams and companies out there that can do that.”
By the way, I should confess that I have a soft spot for Inverse, since I was quoted in one of their articles talking about one of my favorite topics — the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick.",2016-09-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dave-nemetz.png?w=700,,"Science, tech and geek culture site Inverse raises $6M"
663,Josh Constine,"Unless you plan on bumping into stuff, don’t expect to record after-dark concerts and parties on your Snap Inc Spectacles. The company formerly known as Snapchat (they really should have just changed it to the 👻 emoji, Prince-style) confirms to me its new camera glasses are not currently built to be worn at night. Their lenses are like normal sunglasses, so it’d be too shady to see with them on.
This fact reinforces the idea of Spectacles as “a toy”. That’s how Snap CEO Evan Spiegel referred to them while talking to the Wall Street Journal, which never mentioned they’re for day-use only.

When the $130 Specs are released this fall, you might have to stick to barbecues and day-time music festivals when you want to tap the rim of your glasses to record 10 seconds of circular, first-person video.
Perhaps future iterations could come with clear lenses or photochromatic light-adaptive lenses that are dark in the sun and transparent at night or indoors. By ditching extra functionality to keep the price reasonable, Snapchat may be able to market the glasses as an aspirational buy for its teen user base. That will go smoother if it can align Spectacles with celebrities people want to emulate.

The first version of Spectacles might not be as transformational of a technology as some hoped. Yet it gives Snapchat more control of the image capture and saving experience. With time, engineering, and product finesse, Specs could evolve into something we see ourselves wearing whenever we go somewhere we want to share.
But if public perception lumps them in with geeky Google Glass or unnecessary Flipcams, Spiegel will have spent a lot of Snap’s $2 billion-plus in venture capital on something just for him to play with.

664,Lora Kolodny,"As TechCrunch has previously reported, there’s been an exodus of talent from the Rothenberg “ecosystem,” amid claims of a significant breach of fiduciary responsibilities and other unconventional behavior by the venture firm’s founder, Mike Rothenberg.
This week, we have learned more details about alleged employee abuses within Rothenberg Ventures, recently re-branded as Frontier Tech Ventures, as well as the River Group, a virtual reality business including River Studios and several other units.
The allegations are that Rothenberg put pressure on employees to align with his political beliefs in a very public way; left employees without reimbursement for approved work expenses that they charged to their personal cards and accounts; and hectored employees who were on doctor-ordered medical leave to keep working while they were not fit to do so.
An attorney representing Mike Rothenberg said that the allegations being reported today and in prior stories here were “inaccurate to a troubling degree” and “biased” but did not further elaborate.
In more than one instance former employees say Rothenberg pressured colleagues who were on medical leave to continue doing work, even after he had received letters from their doctors ordering time off.
TechCrunch reviewed correspondence between Rothenberg, and an employee confirming that he knew this person was too sick to work, and correspondence that indicates Rothenberg contacted this person during their sick leave with work requests.
Rothenberg also reportedly required employees to pay for approved work expenses on their own debit or credit cards frequently, according to six former employees of the fund and VR business.
In many cases he failed to reimburse them, they said, and even told former employees their expenditures would require new approvals and could be repudiated by him.
As TechCrunch’s Connie Loizos previously reported, former employee and Chief Financial Officer for Rothenberg Ventures Management Co., David Haase, has even filed a lawsuit against Rothenberg for breach of contract and failure to reimburse him for $100,000 in business expenses.
Today, several former employees have more than a thousand dollars in un-reimbursed expenses paid with their personal cards, as a result of this rampant practice, they said.
In some cases, Mike Rothenberg gave executives his own American Express “black card,” to handle large, approved expenses, including to pay vendors for services rendered they said.
Normally such expenses should be paid from a corporate account, and accounts payable department.
Later, some former executives said they were notified by payment tech companies including Square, that their unrelated merchant accounts had been shut down because there was seemingly fraudulent activity associated with their names.
That’s because, former employees explained, there was so much chaotic use, and so many large charges, on their boss’s card and their own personal cards, they were flagged by financial institutions as possibly having been hacked, or worse, committing fraud.
Mike Rothenberg was also thought to be disputing legitimate charges with his credit card provider, former employees believed.
Finally, Rothenberg pressured employees to align with his political beliefs.
According to several former employees in both the venture firm and the virtual reality business, Mike Rothenberg became “obsessed” with the notion of defeating Donald Trump in the forthcoming election.
He would call and text employees at all hours of the day and night, they said, including on their personal mobile phones, to rant about politics, and encourage them to post anti-Trump content to their social media feeds.
Suddenly, without advanced notice to employees or limited partners in Rothenberg Ventures’ funds, Mike Rothenberg unveiled plans for an anti-Trump think tank he called River Institute, at an event called Founder Field Day in May.
The event had been originally planned as a place for investors, industry insiders and members of the press to interact with River-affiliated virtual reality tech startups, and to try out the headsets, VR experiences, games and other technologies that they had developed.
While it was previously reported by TechCrunch’s Connie Loizos and Sarah Buhr that Rothenberg Ventures had potentially mishandled investors’ money and governance of its funds, the new allegations about Mike Rothenberg’s cash management and treatment of employees raise a host of new concerns.",2016-09-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/rothenberg.png?w=738,"river-studios,rothenberg-ventures,mike-rothenberg",Former Rothenberg employees allege mistreatment and cash management problems
665,Matt Klein,"

It has been declared that Twitter has an abuse problem. Whether it was the Milo and Leslie Jones fiasco, the scathing BuzzFeed article or the unveiling of the platform’s own Quality Filter, many are blue in the face from yelling at the platform.
However, blaming Twitter is a narrow-minded argument and a misunderstanding of the true problem at hand. By no means is Twitter faultless, as there is certainly room to grow by solidifying a stance between free speech and censorship. This is a difficult process that platforms such as Facebook and YouTube have gone through before, and still are experiencing. No network is immune, and no one has discovered the perfect balance, even if it existed.
Twitter did not give birth to cyberbullying, nor will they abolish it. Online abuse is omnipresent and not exclusive to one platform over another. It’s a behavior that starts with a mentality, not a platform. Attacking Twitter for its policing or lack thereof does not attack the root of the problem. Even if Twitter ceased to exist tomorrow, online harassment will not expire.
A bully is a bully and a troll is a troll, no matter where you go online. For as long as online mass communication has existed, from the early days of AOL chat rooms, online bullying has existed. So, in order to effectively address the issue of cyberbullying, one must not only question the environments that yield such behaviors, but examine how and why the behavior exists in the first place.
The ability to hide behind not only a screen, and often an unidentifiable name or avatar, unquestionably leaves online harassment to prevail. Whether one’s absolutely anonymous or not, the reduction of faceless communication disallows immediate, raw or physical reactions and consequences.
Infamously stated, “On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” While the comic was originally printed in The New Yorker in July 1993, the claim never rang more true than it does today. You are faceless online. While publications recently touted a study that found “trolls are even more hostile when they’re using their real names,” the support in favor of the counter argument “anonymity promotes online bullying” is far more prevalent, substantial and logical.
With this in mind, one possible counteraction to Twitter’s predicament would be to restore the faces from faceless communication. When verification and accountability exists, it can be presumed that harmful behaviors such as abuse and trolling will curb. However, is this a step in the right direction?
Twitter’s problem is very real indeed, but the implications and possible solutions for this platform are apart of a much larger discussion pertaining to all human-connected developments. Going forward, we need to ask which directions we’d first like to head in. As Jonathan Zittrain, the co-founder of Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, states in Werner Herzog’s film Lo and Behold, “We can design systems that are really anonymous or that are utterly identifiable down to the person, and it’s time for us to think about what contexts we’d want to support what.”

While promoting his latest film, Lo and Behold, Werner Herzog claimed, “The internet is not good or evil, or dark or light-hearted, it’s humans.” This resonates quite well with Twitter. What we end up imagining, producing and enabling online ultimately materializes the reflection of the human collection.
So at the end of the day when we point at a platform like Twitter, which many believe should be held responsible for cyberbullying, we’re accusing inherently innocent defendants. In reality, we should be pointing at ourselves.",2016-09-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-173003430.jpg?w=738,"trolling,trolls,cyberbullying",We’re looking at cyberbullying the wrong way
666,John Mannes,"The art of the lip sync has had a profound impact on the state of our…ok no, but dammit is lip synching fun.
For those of you locked in a Faraday cage, pretending to sing has become all the rage these days. You have Michelle Obama doing it for Carpool Karaoke, Tim Cook using it to open up events, and of course the ever entertaining LL Cool J and Chrissy Teigen using it as a platform for the Spike series, Lip Sync Battle. On the show, celebrities battle each other by pretending to sing songs with dramatic effect. With a new app, anyone can now jam out in battles with their friends.
It’s quite hard to go wrong with such a fun starting point, and for the most part, the app’s creators Wurrly, Spike TV, and Casey Patterson Entertainment, don’t let us down. Upon opening the app and selecting create, users are presented with a list of genres including pop, rock, rap, country, classics, and latin. There are also themed categories like love songs and a special section for tracks coming from prior Lip Sync Battles. Once you pick a song, the next step is to get to work recording.
Rather than just straight recording on top of an audio track like in Dubsmash, songs are accompanied with lyrics to make it possible to record in one take. Users can also select a number of accessories that serve a similar purpose as lenses in Snapchat. You can go for a crazy glasses vibe, a cat ears look, and even a full flower child outfit. 
Wurrly did most of the development of the accessories and facial tracking in house. The groundwork has already been laid alongside another company called Facio to do emotional recognition. This means that in the future, tattoos, masks and other accessories will be able to alter their appearance based on your emotional state. If you’re singing a sad verse in a ballad, a mask could animate differently than during the power hook of a pop song.
“Our intention was really to create a world of fun,” said Nadine Levitt, CEO of Wurrly.
At the end of filming your epic production, there is a list of post processing effects you can choose from to put the final touches on a battle. This includes things like confetti intros, lights and pyro effects.
Apps that license songs often struggle to build up and maintain a healthy and attractive music catalog. Levitt cites a relationship with Universal Music Group as one of the key factors that helped to get the licensing process off the ground. The starting library is diverse and even includes a number of country songs that haven’t garnered much attention on the show itself. Levitt sees the app as a way to continue to build the Lip Sync Battle community.
To generate revenue, Wurrly will be offering specialty items to its community at a price. This could include limited addition effects and masks. Because the app has such a strong relationship with a real world show generating new content every week, Lip Sync Battle can also benefit by leveraging promotional content to boost fan engagement.
The early version of the app works pretty smoothly although one drawback is that creations are tied to the app itself. You can share them for battles and link videos on social media, but they ultimately pull you back into the app. Synching between lyrics and music was also an issue in a few instances. Lyrics for the Eminem and Rihanna track Love the Way You Lie seemed oddly timed, and in one case, the lyrics for the Lynyrd Skynyrd hit Free Bird were incorrect. These were all relatively minor quips and will hopefully be fixed by the time heavy traffic starts battling.
If you’re not already into the craze, the premise of lip syncing may seem about as odd as watching American Idol on mute while listening to the track on Spotify. However, there is something special about a nonjudgemental space where you can truly step away and not care about anything other than having fun with your friends. I spent about an hour after 5pm on a Friday making the gem below in the TechCrunch offices. I can’t completely say there was no office judgement, but as promised, it surely was a world of fun.

667,Carl Szabo,"

Detroit doesn’t place burdensome regulations on automobile manufacturers; Idaho doesn’t put undue restrictions and hurdles in front of potato farmers; and California takes steps to protect its farmers — because these industries are part of the lifeblood and identity of their respective states.
These industries do more than just create jobs, tax revenue and prestige — they became a symbol of who they are, part of the fabric of the community and the economy. So it’s no surprise that their legislators focus on doing all they can to ensure that they thrive and survive. It really isn’t anything novel; it happens in almost every state.
And then there’s San Francisco. The city appears hell-bent on hurting the innovation industry that has made the it the tech capital of the world. The tech industry creates hundreds of high-paying jobs and millions in tax revenue and has helped turn San Francisco into one of the most sought-after locales in the country.
When companies such as Twitter, Airbnb, Zynga and others emerge in San Francisco, they perpetuate an innovation life cycle as they act as incubators for the next generation of entrepreneurs that will continue the economic boom.
Despite all that, San Francisco seems intent on killing the golden goose. Instead of celebrating the growth of tech companies that add millions upon millions to the tax coffers, San Francisco demonizes their success.
It starts with a proposed payroll tax that would only apply to tech companies. Eric Mar, a member of the city’s Board of Supervisors, even went so far as to say that the tax would serve as indemnification for the “downside of the technology boom,” according to The New York Times.
It continues with the shutting down of private bus services for tech workers that reduce traffic and pollution and encourage residents to stay in the city. And, finally, San Francisco continues its battle with ride-sharing companies by mandating fingerprints and trying to shoehorn ride-sharing entrepreneurs into “employee” status.
And lest we talk about the draconian regulations on home-sharing platforms that will cost San Franciscans millions… As a city that is home to sharing services like Airbnb, rather than embrace them, the city is consistently looking to pass laws to make them illegal.
Rises wages and living costs are issues that are no doubt placing an added burden on the middle class of San Francisco. We need solutions to ensure that the San Francisco middle class doesn’t go extinct. But scapegoating San Francisco’s innovation leaders isn’t going to make the problem go away. On the contrary, it will make it worse.
While San Francisco’s leaders attack tech industries, other cities recognize their benefit and are wooing these high-paying jobs to leave the Bay Area — and bring their taxes and prestige.
Myriad other municipalities — from Boulder to Salt Lake City — are all taking steps to turn their city into the new tech-mecca. Through tax incentives, low-costs of living and an eager and educated work-pool, these cities are more than willing to woo the next generation of entrepreneurs to start their businesses there.
Hopefully, San Francisco legislators will realize the amazing gift that arrived in their city — hundreds of talented, motivated, highly educated and innovative individuals. And rather than looking this gift-horse in the mouth and passing legislation that makes housing less affordable and adds more traffic to clogged streets and pollution to the air, the city will embrace the tech innovations, and innovators, that have made it the envy of the world.
If not, San Francisco may soon see its tech-title taken away. If that happens, no doubt there will be hand-wringing, finger-pointing and questions about what went wrong.",2016-09-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-107950655.jpg?w=738,"payroll-taxes,san-francisco",Why is San Francisco trying to strangle its golden goose?
668,Haje Jan Kamps,"There’s no denying that your smartphone’s camera is getting better and better for every generation, but what’s a poor photography nerd to do about controllability? Miggo’s Kickstarter-funded Pictar is shipping soon, and might be just the thing to teach your iPhone some additional photography skills. At Photokina, I had a chance to try it myself.
“Smartphones have great cameras,” says Sean Henry, the photography industry veteran who brought Pictar to life. “But for advanced users, the functions are either hidden or hard to get to.”
Pictar is a fantastically clever solution to that precise problem. It adds a grip with a shutter button and three control wheels to the iPhone. One of the wheels controls the zoom, one is programmable to a number of different functions, and the last is an exposure compensation wheel. The shutter button includes focus / exposure lock on a half-press much like you would find on traditional cameras. And, of course, it takes a photo when you depress the button fully.

Pictar is one of those rare products that I never really knew I needed in my life until I tried it myself. Yes, it seems dumb and it is so easy to write it off as a gimmick… But you’d be wrong to do that until you’ve tried it. I’ve certainly never felt I needed a real shutter button on my phone. Having said that, the feeling of relief of being able to make adjustments by turning wheels rather than having to do complicated multi-touch or touch-and-hold maneuvers is strong. As a photographer, the product makes the iPhone feel like a much more capable piece of photographic kit, which is a remarkable accomplishment by Miggo.
All of that isn’t to say that the product is completely perfect; the button-press for the shutter button felt a bit stiff compared to what you find even on an entry-level compact camera, and it’s hard to know by feel whether or not you’ve succeeded in doing a half-press. The turn wheels also felt a bit cheap — cheaper than its $120 price tag would indicate. If there’s ever a second version of it, I hope the manufacturers either drop the price or increase the feel of the product to be more in line with the phones it is designed to contain.
“We are shipping in December,” Henry confirms. “If you want one as soon as possible, pre-order sooner rather than later!”",2016-09-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/20160924-_dsc3356.jpg?w=738,"photokina-2016,smartphone-accessories","Hands-on with Pictar, which adds buttons and wheels to your iPhone camera"
669,Haje Jan Kamps,"You may know Yi Technologies from its action cameras or its fancy, carbon-fiber drones, but at Photokina, the company launched its first mirrorless Micro Four Thirds camera, the Yi M1. Sporting a 20 mpx Sony IMX269 sensor, a high-quality 3-inch touch-screen and a raft of sharing-friendly features, it’s crashing into a space that has been stale for a while.
At launch, the company has two lenses available – a decent all-rounder in the form of a 12-40mm f/3.5-5.6 lens, and a portrait prime clocking in at 42.5mm f/1.8. The camera uses the Micro Four Thirds (MFT) lens mount, however, so it’s possible to tap into years and years worth of high-quality glass from a number of different manufacturers already.
I had a chance to try the camera and I was initially underwhelmed; weighing in at 280g, I found it hard to keep stable (it weighs a third of my everyday shooter, which itself is a tiny little thing carved out of a block of metal) and the controls were counter-intuitive enough that I didn’t immediately make friends with them. As someone who handles a lot of different cameras; that’s pretty rare and a little worrying.
It’s possible that the company is falling victim to its “minimalist design”. Minimalist is all good and well, of course, until you need to quickly adjust the settings on your camera. For much of the same reason that it is tricky to use Lytro’s Illum, controlling the Yi M1 feels a bit ham-fisted to experienced photographers.
In not including decent controls on the camera, it makes you wonder who this little thing is for. Yes, it’s small and has a good sensor, so you’d think it’d be perfect for travel photographers, but because its lenses don’t collapse out of the way, it isn’t as portable as you might want.
DIYPhotography reports that the price for the camera plus a lens will be $499, although the folks manning the booth resolutely refused to comment on the pricing, saying it was “still being confirmed”. The company does confirm it is shipping the camera later this year, however.

I only spent a few minutes with the camera and it is entirely possible that it grows on you after extended use. Unfortunately, cameras aren’t bought on extended use, but on reviews and on first impressions in person. Yi had best cross its fingers for glowing versions of the former, because on the latter, it falls significantly short of the mark.

670,Matthew Lynley,"Instacart is one of the most well-known companies in what can be an extremely difficult on-demand delivery economy. It’s known for being one of the pioneers of a new age of online grocery delivery, especially in light of the previous failure of companies like Webvan, but it’s going to have a long uphill battle to profitability and sustainability.
Instacart CEO Apoorva Mehta, however, says he thinks the company can get to cash-flow positive in the next year, and that’s thanks to the company’s attempt at bringing in a diverse number of revenue streams instead of just relying on a cut of the transaction costs. He tried to hammer that point home on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016 today.
“We have partnerships with hundreds of retailers who also do a revenue share with us, but we also have CPG companies such as Pepsi, Proctor & Gamble, who promote their products on Instacart,” Mehta said. “As a result of that we have a third source of revenue most people forget about. The key point here is that all on-demand companies do not look the same.”
There’s certainly logic to the argument. The existing promotion method for CPG companies is coupons, in which there’s little targeting and it’s not clear if it’s acquiring new customers. With analytics from Instacart, those companies could better target products against customers that might be more likely to buy those products, and in turn become loyal customers and keep driving additional revenue.

 
The company attempts to have a three-pronged revenue strategy: partnerships with grocery stores to drive additional traffic, advertising with consumer packaged goods companies, and then the fees from the customer. But in the next few years that CPG advertising may grow to be a huge portion of the company’s revenue. It begs the question as to whether the company, with those other two revenue streams, may be able to reduce the cost on the customer to zero.
Of course, that’d be a good thing for the customer — and create the opportunity for more deliveries. And as the company makes its deliveries more efficient, drivers can deliver more products, and then handle more orders per hour and theoretically make more money. That’s Mehta’s justification for a recent drop in wages.
“Four years ago when I started this company none of these things existed,” Mehta said on stage. “You couldn’t get groceries delivered in one hour, you couldn’t get them delivered from all grocery stores in a market. Today Instacart does this, as a result of that we grew to get to this point very, very fast. We went from having three markets to 15 — when you grow so fast obviously you’re going to have adjustments you’re going to have to make. When we think about the wage changes, the reason we had to do so, the wages made sense in three markets did’nt make sense for 15 markets.”
Instacart has a heavy presence in the Bay Area at least. The company secures Instacart-only express lanes for its couriers in order to shorten the delivery time for its products. Eventually, it wants to offer a “bypass checkout” option for its couriers, allowing its couriers to skip the register. This is all in an attempt to lower the time between orders, increasing the frequency of which it can sell products and take off a share of those purchases.
Instacart isn’t the only company in the on-demand space — nor is it one that’s facing challenges. But there are emerging competitors that are also raising large rounds of financing like Postmates, which is raising at least $100 million in a new round of financing that isn’t a down round, we reported earlier this month. Instacart launched out of Y Combinator in 2012.
Managing the partnership minefield may be increasingly complex, especially with Whole Foods looking to take a share of the company. It’s going to have to grapple with the optics of favoritism, which might frustrate other potential and existing partners as it would encourage shoppers to gravitate toward faster-operating grocery providers for the shortest delivery time. In the end, it may make sense for Instacart to exist within the empire of a large grocery provider, but we’ll have to see where the outcome lands.
Would Instacart sell to whole foods? Mehta says, at least for now, the answer is no:
“The reality is that Instacart works with lots of different grocery stores, it just doesn’t make sense for us to even think about selling to a grocery store, not to mention as a company what we want to achieve, the best path for us it to continue being an independent company,” he said.
We’ll see what the response is in a year or so, at least.",2016-09-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/disrupt_sf16_apoorva_mehta-4077.jpg?w=738,"techcrunch-disrupt-sf,techcrunch-disrupt-sf-2016,apoorva-mehta",How Apoorva Mehta hopes to build an Instacart empire with a promoted ad business
671,Matthew Lynley,"Twitter needs to figure out a way to continue to grow — and it certainly seems open to looking into a lot of new places outside your phone to figure out how to do that.
Today, the company said it is launching an app on the Apple TV, Xbox One and Amazon Fire TV, which will allow users to view Twitter content through the apps on their televisions. That includes live streams of 10 NFL Thursday Night Football games, as well as other live streaming footage available on Twitter. On the Apple TV, users will be able to view live streaming and top tweets side-by-side on their televisions, as well as top Vines and Periscopes.
So this is an interesting one for a couple of reasons: First, it opens up a whole world of live streaming content to Apple TV and such owners. That’s going to be a boon for cord cutters that are always on the hunt for new content, and as Twitter continues to sign new partnerships with organizations like the NFL for additional live streams, it’s going to open a lot of doors to new content for people who aren’t interested in investing in cable subscriptions.

Secondly, and also eyebrow-raising, the company said that people don’t need a Twitter account, nor cable or satellite subscriptions, to access HD Streams. It’s worth paying attention to its so-called logged-out users, which are harder to track and target due to a lack of an interest graph. But those users can still consume Twitter content — and a lot of that content is likely consumed through distribution in front of logged-out users.

For example, just a few days ago Twitter launched an Alexa app. With that app, users can listen to the latest tweets and contents through an Echo speaker. Again, we’re talking about a new form factor — and it again shows that Twitter is clearly interested in looking beyond just the traditional second screen experience it’s been known for. (It also speaks to the increasing importance of the Alexa ecosystem, but that’s a bit of a different story.)
As usual, the more eyeballs it attracts, the more advertising it can attract and partnerships it can continue to sign if it shows that it’s able to create a highly engaged audience around live events. An app tied to live streaming on the Apple TV, of course, makes a lot of sense because live events have always been Twitter’s sweet spot, whether that’s the Super Bowl or the Olympics, or the election.
Twitter’s core app growth is clearly stalling a bit — and it’s punishing the company, with its stock down almost 35% in the past year, and plenty of quarterly misses to go along with it. It’s going to have to get creative in order to re-ignite growth and show the world, and Wall Street, that it can be a strong independent company that can deliver positive results. And that willingness to step out of a comfort zone may be a good sign that, at the very least, they’re going to look for the next generation of the Twitter experience beyond just 140 characters.",2016-09-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/tvos-video-timeline.jpg?w=738,"tvos,fire-tv","Twitter launches on Apple TV, Fire TV and Xbox One"
672,Anthony Ha,"Google is announcing a couple of upgrades to its ad capabilities today as part of the DMEXCO digital media conference in Germany.
First up are its Universal App Campaigns, where developers can promote their apps across search, display, Google Play and YouTube advertising. Google says these campaigns have resulted in more than 3 billion app downloads, but earlier this year, it also said developers would be able to target users who are likely to take a specific action (not just installing the app). Now it’s announcing that this targeting option is available to all advertisers.
Here’s how Google lays out the process in its official blog post:

673,Brian Heater,"Wait for others to take the first steps, let things mature a bit, then swoop in with a simpler, more unified solution. It’s the first entry on the first page of the Apple playbook. And it tends to work like a charm.
If you’re reading this, odds are pretty good that you’re in possession of some small piece of the connected home puzzle, a smart lightbulb or thermostat or maybe a security camera. Odds are also pretty good that if you’ve more than one such device, your handset is littered with just as many proprietary apps. It’s one of the great ironies of the connected home – it’s not really all that, you know, connected.
Apple has been playing around in the space for a couple of years now. HomeKit was first announced WWDC in 2014, as part its big iOS 8 unveil. But it wasn’t a consumer facing solution, so much as a way to make sure that hardware and software developers were tailoring their technology to the company’s mobile operating system.

It would be a full two years – and two major iOS releases – before Apple put its stamp on the consumer experience with the Home app for iOS 10 (out today, full review here). With Home, the functionality is built into the operating system’s DNA, via Control Center.
There’s little question, really, why the company took its time here. The smart home is hard. It’s big and it’s broad, encompassing a huge variety of devices and functionality – and it’s littered with the bodies of failed attempts that just couldn’t get the job done. After all, it’s a lot to ask for a single unified solution designed to control a door lock, air conditioner and window shades all at the same time.
There’s probably no one better positioned to take on the challenge than Apple. The company already has a massive install base, along with a trio of devices that provide different methods for interacting with the system – the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV, the latter of which serves as a permanent in-home hub, so users can interact with the functionality from afar.
 Home is a compelling next step. Over the past two years, the company has laid the framework for its connected home strategy through Homekit, and the iOS 10 functionality finally starts to deliver them under one room. Functionality is built into the Control Panel, with that familiar translucent overlay, though it still takes a bit of swiping to access, perhaps betraying the fact that the company doesn’t quite consider this a mainstream feature for the moment.
It’s through that channel that most will likely interact with the functionality. The actual app is most useful during the setup process, which lets users group products into different rooms, create geofencing (so, say, your lights turn on when you enter your house), and put together “scenes,” packing different functionality into a single button press, so you can, say, turn off the lights and close the curtains when it’s time to go to bed.
I suspect that most casual users won’t be all that interested in designing complex scenes, but there’s definitely value for those who demand complete control or just enjoy the work of developing different scenarios. It will be interesting to see if Apple doubles down and makes the whole set up even more customizable.
The notion of the smart home has been around for quite some time, but past instances have either been cost prohibitive or far too fragmented. Home isn’t yet the catchall solution Apple is banking on, but it does feel like a compelling step toward cross-device unification as we line our walls and desks with ever more connected products.",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/p9110840.jpg?w=738,"home,homekit",Apple works to fit the smart home under a single roof
674,Matthew Lynley,"Everything is getting hacked to the point that it’s getting kind of ridiculous — and everyone needs to have secure passwords. The trouble, however, is making them tough to crack and also being able to remember them. That’s led to a blossoming ecosystem of password management services like OnePassword.
But if you ask Antoine Vincent Jebara and Priscilla Elora Sharuk, that’s not going far enough. Instead of locking those passwords away online and accessing them when you need to log in, their startup Myki looks to keep them locked away on your phone instead. Users can activate the Myki Chrome extension to log into various services through their phone, but the passwords are never kept on remote servers — and even administrators don’t know what they are once new passwords are issued. The company launched at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016.
“A big concern is the passwords are still in the cloud and people don’t want them to have access,” Jebara said. “Even when it comes to lawful access, in our case we don’t hold any sensitive info, which you can’t give away. We don’t want to have it, it’s your right to own and known where your proprietary data is.”
Here’s how it works: When a user decides to log into a service — it can be anything, really — they’ll choose to log in through Myki. They then authenticate that login on their phone through the Myki app, which is locked by fingerprint or PIN in addition to managed remotely, and the password and login is dropped into the browser.
Through an administrative panel, users can authorize a variety of services, whether traditional browser logins or complex enterprise software, for login through Myki. The company generates passwords for those services that are then passed over to the phone and kept there instead of online. The passwords and login signals relay back and forth from the phone in order to log into various services, and administrators can assign passwords to be reset on a regular basis.
Myki is also constantly reporting back information about the logins. The administrative panel logs physical addresses, phone status (even battery level), IP addresses, geographic area, times and other kinds of irregular behavior, aiming to keep as many tabs on your password usage as possible. If something gets breached (through user fault or just a general hack) administrators can instantly trigger a mass reset, issuing new passwords to every user. Users operate the app using their phone number rather than typical credentials in an attempt to ensure that everything revolves around owning and operating a phone.
“What interests us is that the user is the owner of the phone,” Jebara said. “If GitHub gets breached, you need to do a mass reset of passwords — this takes time in the enterprise, and you have to pray for [users] not to change the password with only a slight variation.”
The goal here is to ensure that passwords remain complex, difficult to crack and easily accessible. Users have the option of looking at the passwords within the app (though an administrator can actually disable this, even though they don’t actually have access to the password), but they are designed to be kept on the device and away from remote servers that could potentially be breached.

Here’s another cool one: Users can actually share their login credentials with one another on a highly regulated basis. So if I need to give one of my colleagues a login to Getty or Shutterstock, for example, I can authorize them to use my account on a limited basis, and revoke that access at any time. Again, they’ll never see the password — that’s just for the account owner.
Right now, the company isn’t built into various mobile device management providers, but that’s another welcome opportunity, Jebara said. “We like the idea of bundling with MDM providers because they do root detection. If you root your phone that’s where we draw the line. If you use an MDM provider and push the key, they do root the detection, and we do access management, and it becomes more powerful.”
There’s always a risk for sticking all your passwords in one place. If your phone is compromised for some reason, like stolen by someone who somehow manages to crack the core iOS security and Myki, they’ll have access to everything to which you’ve given Myki access. To get around that — obviously use all the existing security features — Myki users can quickly revoke access to the device.
Right now the company is targeting companies as primary providers, but there’s obviously a consumer hook to it, as well. If users start relying on it for their traditional work login, they may want to tie in their Gmail and Facebook passwords — and IT managers won’t have access to that information, Jebara said.
There’s a reason all these password managers are reaching popularity — and companies are actively encouraging them. Often, user password behavior is pretty bad. They’ll re-use the same password for multiple accounts, the passwords won’t be strong, and they aren’t changed that often. That’s prompted a lot of breaches in the past several years, with hundreds of millions of credentials hitting the web.
With Myki, Jebara is hoping to take that level of security one step further, and make it even easier to log in and out of services. Time will tell if having everything locked away on your phone will work out in their favor — but it’s certainly something that Apple is trying to do, keeping a lot of operations on the phone instead of the cloud. The fewer the touch points where individuals can capture sensitive information, the better, Jebara said.",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/main-location-based-rule.png?w=738,"techcrunch-disrupt,battlefield,techcrunch-disrupt-sf",Myki rolls out a password manager that locks all your info away on your phone
675,Romain Dillet,"Today has been a massive Apple update day. The company released iOS 10, tvOS 10 and also watchOS 3. After announcing it at WWDC, it’s finally here — and it’s a huge update.
I won’t mention all the changes with watchOS 3. Instead, I’ll focus on three topics — speed, app switching and watch face switching.
With watchOS 3, your favorite apps stay in memory so it feels much faster when you launch it. How fast you might ask? Nearly instantaneous, even on the original Apple Watch. And I can confirm that you’ll definitely feel the difference in action.
In addition to this much-needed improvement, Apple has changed the behavior of the side button. Instead of opening up the Friends screen, the side button now lets you switch between your favorite apps in a Dock view. It feels like using the app switcher on iOS, but much faster.
These two modifications have turned me into an Apple Watch app user again. I’ve never stopped wearing my Apple Watch, but the key features have always been reading the time and getting notifications on my wrist.
I found glances not really helpful and the home screen too hard to use — you don’t want to spend 30 seconds digging for an app and launching it. But with the Dock, I’ve set up my favorite apps and I use them quite a lot. It’s easy to open them, they load quickly and they work well for quick interactions.
Finally, changing your watch face was a bit cumbersome with watchOS 2. You had to deep press on your watch, then scroll, then select. Now, you can swipe left and right to switch from one watch face from another.
Instead of using the same watch face every day, I find myself changing it up depending on what I’m wearing, turning the Apple Watch into a versatile fashion accessory. People who like switching bands will like this feature as well.
If you want to download watchOS 3, plug in your Apple Watch, go to the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and install the update. It’s going to take a while, so I recommend doing it at home where you can leave your watch on the charging cable.",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/0100.jpg?w=738,watchos,Apple also released watchOS 3 today and here’s what’s new
676,Matthew Lynley,"Meetings are probably never going to die — and, along with that, neither are presentations. But the traditional route for making presentations is getting a little outdated, with tools like PowerPoint getting updated regularly but lacking a certain simplicity to them.
That’s why Owen Bossola and Hakim El Hattab decided to start Slides, an online service for creating, viewing and collaborating on slideshow presentations. The goal of Slides is to bring together all the best parts of discrete presentation management services out there, like PowerPoint and SlideShare, and make it one seamless experience.
“There’s always a need for visual storytelling, and Slides at its core is a tool for visual storytelling,” El Hattab said. “Maybe you get more efficient with Slack, but with sales and marketing and education, there’s all these use cases that require presentation software. People present in a thousand different ways. We just try to tackle all of those.”
The creation experience is pretty much what you’d expect. You’ll find various features that are present in a lot of other creation experiences and, following that, users can share links to the presentations and ways to watch them unfold in real time during a meeting. There’s also a limited commenting section built into the service, which is still in the sort of developmental phase, as Bossola and El Hattab didn’t want to feature creep the service right away.
Slideshow presenters can also embed content from other services within the presentations. Because everything is viewed online, everything is therefore rendered on the Web — so rendering complex visuals can be more seamless instead of having to download complex PDF files or 3D visuals.

All this works in Slides’ favor, because it makes the approach to making presentations much more flexible. The composition tool has a quite similar feel to other standard tools (though it’s made to look a little more slick than existing ones), including features like altering the color schema to make sure text doesn’t get washed away in a darker background. The objects snap to a grid, it’s easy to import additional content and users have access to a lot of pre-existing templates — whether they’re made by the company or the standard stock slides offered by the company.
Presenters can also use their phones as a combo clicker-note taking application, using it to advance through slides and review their notes on those slides. The tool — while highly flexible for developers — is clearly geared toward marketers and others who need to put together presentations, and trying to make that whole process as easy and seamless as possible. Naturally, there’s a big market for this (giant applications like PowerPoint wouldn’t get regular updates if it weren’t).
“Since our format, at the end of it, is a website, you have a website for your presentation,” Bossola said. “Within that website you can include anything you can include in a website. All these specific kinds of areas, we have a lot of people in education that use text to write math formulas. We can be instantly flexible because it’s web based.”
There’s an obvious consumer application to all this. It’d be great to have this kind of a tool when giving a presentation in college, for example, instead of having to wander through the Web for other tools or dealing with school licenses for PowerPoint. But the main sweet spot for Slides is going to be larger marketing divisions in companies, which are always going to need good tools to make engaging presentations.
Slides is actually built on some open-source software technology that El Hattab had been developing over time. Developers were using the tools to create presentations, but had to hand-code them — which made El Hattab and Bossola realize they had a potential company on their hands. The company still plans to contribute to that resource, as well as update their service with any new tools components that come in from the community like bug and security fixes. There’s always a risk of building a company on top of open-source software, but El Hattab said that it’s part of the company’s DNA, and there are plenty of success stories like Automattic.
There is, of course, competition in the form of companies like Bunkr and Swipe. The Slides team has quite a long history in the content development space, with Bossola previously working at Thrillist and El Hattab coming from a digital production company. The hope is that if the company can keep the tools as simple, flexible and widely applicable as possible, they’ll finally have a PowerPoint killer on their hands.

677,Lora Kolodny,"For all the high-tech advances in healthcare when it comes to drugs and devices, doctors, their back offices, pharmacies, labs that conduct health tests and insurance providers aren’t exactly in easy communication about or with the people in their care.
And patients don’t have a single, easy place to interact with doctors and track their own medical data.
That’s a hard thing to believe in a post-mobile and post-social era.
Carbon Health, which presented on stage at TechCrunch’s Disrupt SF Startup Battlefield today, is aiming to change all of this with a platform that serves as a sophisticated electronic health records system and billing platform for even the smallest private practice.
Of greater importance for patients, Carbon Health lets users schedule appointments with their doctors, pay for them and keep and have access to all their own health records in one mobile app.
Co-founded by Udemy chairman Eren Bali, Carbon Health is launching its own private practice in San Francisco to pilot-test its service. It intends to allow other health practitioners to join its platform in early 2017, Bali said.
The startup currently employs 11 people full time. It is raising funding to expand its staff and hone its patient-facing and back-end apps.
“There isn’t a massive single piece of this that represents some huge technological breakthrough,” Bali admitted. “But what’s challenging was to build a holistic experience. Most current products in healthcare suck because they are fixing one small thing like just scheduling or just billing and they are not patient-focused.”
The company intends to generate revenue by taking 7 percent from the total billing that doctors process through the Carbon Health platform. Its app will be free for patients to use, and the software will cost nothing to doctors who want to begin using it in lieu of other expensive and disparate systems to run their businesses.",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/disrupt_sf16_carbon-2765.jpg?w=738,"health-tech,battlefield",Carbon Health wants to put medical data in one place for patients and their many doctors
678,Matthew Lynley,"Zenefits at one point was one of the fastest growing software companies in the world, rocketing to a $4.5 billion valuation in 18 months. It was on track to generate tens of millions of dollars in annual recurring revenue.
Then, everything went south; regulators started investigating the company, and its CEO Parker Conrad was fired from the company earlier this year. In short, it’s been a bumpy eight months since the incident for new CEO David Sacks, who took over when Conrad exited, and he’s eager to put all that behind the company and himself. He made it abundantly clear on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016. Now the company is looking forward to the launch of its next version of Zenefits, due out next month.
“The way to win trust is to just make right a situation, whatever mistakes you’ve made previously,” Sacks said. “Our attitude at Zenefits today is to be very transparent and forthright about what happened, it’s not to double down on something wrong in the past, it’s to admit it, fix it, and move on. That’s what we’ve done, and I think as a result we’re in a great position to move forward. A lot of pain the company took upfront in the past six months, at this point it’s over, we’re excited to focus on the future.”

Sacks said that he, as well as many other executives, were not aware of the macro after thorough investigation that even drilled into emails. He said after joining as chief operating officer in December 2014, he did not have a number of divisions reporting to him, and was as unaware of the problem as investors were. It’s a small wonder it was kept as tight as it was, but in the end the company has had to aggressively pay for those mistakes.
And there’s still plenty of drama. Zenefits — and Sacks — still seem to have yet to shake the perception that it’s still under fire, even amid its vigorous efforts to put those problems behind it and settle with states. In total, Zenefits has paid out about $300,000 in settlements in six states, Sacks said, though the investigation in California is still ongoing.
Amid all this, the company has had to redirect both the company and its internal culture. In order to head off lawsuits from existing investors, Zenefits cut its valuation in half and the company has laid off more than 350 people. Sacks said the company was down to 900 employees, from 1,450 when he took over as CEO. To say the course-correction is aggressive is a bit of an understatement, but it’s pretty much required for a company that had so many issues when Sacks walked in the door.
“A lot of the stuff was honestly the media getting carried away, that was not something that happened,” Sacks said, likely in reference to a story from The Wall Street Journal about alerting employees not to have sex in the company’s stairwells. “In terms of the culture, what we’ve done is declare new values, the reason we did that is because compliance is really important.”
In terms of Conrad, and his potential ambitions to go after a similar company, Sacks didn’t have much to say. Conrad also took $10 million off the table ahead of his exit, plenty to get something rolling. Sacks said he had not been in touch with Conrad and did not know what he was up to (who, at least with that money, seems like he doesn’t have to just yet win back the trust of investors that Zenefits has to grapple with.)
“My attitude toward valuation, it’s never something you set, it arises through a process,” Sacks said. “People want to invest in a company and the valuation is determined through that. I never take a position on what valuation should be. I do think the company has an obligation to be transparent about everything that’s gone wrong.”",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/disrupt_sf16_david_sacks-3714.jpg?w=738,"david-sacks,techcrunch-disrupt-sf,parker-conrad",CEO David Sacks on moving on from Zenefits’ troubled past
679,Lora Kolodny,"Entrepreneurs building tech products for women spoke at TechCrunch Disrupt SF today, and called on their peers in the industry to set a high ethical bar when it comes to using or sharing women’s intimate data.
Janica Alvarez’s startup Naya Health makes a smart breast pump and bottle to help nursing mothers know exactly how much milk they’re producing and how much their babies are consuming.
Alvarez cited a Rock Health study that estimated there was about $4.5 billion in venture capital investments in digital health last year, and a quarter of that went into biosensing products, like her company’s.
She hoped that insights that will soon come from technology, particularly to help nursing mothers keep breastfeeding their babies if they want to, especially after they go back to work. She said, “We need better solutions but we won’t find them without data.”
The CEO of Fertility IQ, Deborah Anderson-Bialis, agreed. On her own company’s site, users are asked to enter 80 data points about their health and fertility, and experiences with IVF or in-vitro fertilization treatments. They share reviews and information with a community of women who want to but are struggling to get pregnant.
Fertility IQ takes care to verify that those who write reviews and offer information on her site are actually the patients of the doctors they review to keep review quality high. But even with all that sharing, privacy is of tantamount importance to users who don’t want their health issues aired publicly, or don’t want doctors who they may not have reviewed favorably to seek revenge.
Then the CEO of a company that makes the popular period-tracking app Clue, Ida Tin, said she was looking forward to a time when wearables and mobile phones could do more technically complex things like disease detection.
But she cautioned, “I’m excited about looking into the body on a molecular level….but companies like mine generate really intimate data. They should have a very high ethical bar for what they do with that information. This is not common in the industry, yet.”
In light of the privacy concerns, moderator Sarah Buhr questioned Tin about a new feature within the Clue app that lets users share their data with one another. Privacy flaws were uncovered and addressed recently by a fertility tracker app called Glow which competes with Clue.
Tin said Clue Connect, a feature that launched this month, was actually one case where users wanted to be able to share their data, albeit privately, with their loved ones.
“Women tell us that they want to share with their partners, or a mom or daughter, or a good friend. A lot of men also want to know what’s going on in their dear one’s lives. I think that’s great, it helps us communicate about social health, not just about periods but how do I feel, am I in pain, where is my sex drive.”",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/deborah-anderson-bialis-janica-alverez-ida-tin42.jpg?w=738,"clue,janica-alvarez",Health tech founders call for high ethical bar for use of women’s intimate data
680,Josh Constine,"Facebook Messenger has built an unlaunched feature called Rooms that lets groups publicly chat about different subjects and events. Buried in Messenger’s iOS app’s source code are multiple references to the feature, with some explanation of how it works.
The code shows: “Introducing rooms”, “Rooms are for public conversations about topics and interests. Each room has a link that can be shared so anyone on Messenger can join the conversation”. You can apparently start your own Rooms as well. The blue circle image above is listed as a Rooms logo in the code (the darker background and illustration of a home is ours).
TechCrunch received a tip off about the code from developer evangelist Chris Messina. When we asked Facebook if it was building a Messenger Rooms feature, the company told me “We don’t have any comment on this speculation.” However, here are screenshots of the excavated Messenger code about Rooms:
 
 
 
 
 
 
[Update 11:15am PT: After being shown the screenshots of the code, Facebook provided a different statement, saying “We often run small tests – nothing else to share beyond that.”]
[Update 12:10pm PT: TechCrunch has now attained screenshots of the Messenger Rooms feature from our reader Hoan Do.
The screenshots show how users can join public rooms, chat with friends as well as strangers using the standard Messenger interface and features, how to manage a Room, and the ability to share the Room to get other people to join. You can try joining a Room with this link.
The Messenger Rooms feature is reminiscent of the standalone Rooms app that Facebook launched in 2014 but shut down in 2015. It let people be pseudonymous and join interest-based discussion groups. It didn’t receive much widespread traction, though, and was removed from the app store.
Rooms might not be available to any users or could be in very limited testing. It might never roll out more widely depending on user reactions. But the feature could help Facebook fill in the middle-ground between broad News Feed sharing to your whole social graph, and private messaging to your closest friends. Rooms could become the Messenger counterpart to Facebook’s popular Groups feature that’s grown to see over 1 billion monthly active users.
Rooms could unlock more engagement on Facebook about niche topics that most of your friends might not care about, but someone out there does. While Groups is great for threaded posts about a topic, those don’t quite feel alive. Rooms could capture the fast-moving, fun conversations that once lived in the chat rooms of web 1.0.",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/facebook-messenger-rooms.png?w=738,facebook-messenger,Facebook Messenger’s source code reveals hidden Rooms feature
681,Romain Dillet,"Apple has just released iOS 10, the final version. If you want to get the latest iOS features and put a fresh coat of paint on your device, it’s time to update your iPhone or iPad. The update is currently rolling out and is available both over-the-air in the Settings app, and by plugging your device into iTunes for a wired update.
If you don’t see the update right away, don’t panic as it could take a few minutes. If you can’t download it right away, it’s because Apple now has a queue system for big updates like iOS 10 to ensure speedy downloads.
As there is going to be tremendous demand for iOS 10 with tens of millions of people trying to update their devices, it could take an hour or more before the actual download starts. But first, backup your device. Make sure your iCloud backup is up to date by going to your iPhone or iPad settings. Additionally, you can also plug your iOS device to your computer to do a manual backup in iTunes (or do both, really).
Once this is done, you should go to the Settings app as soon as possible to get in the queue. Navigate to ‘Settings,’ then ‘General’ and then ‘Software Update.’ Then you should see ‘Update Requested…” It will then automatically start downloading once the download is available.
iOS 10 features a massive Siri update with third-party integrations. For instance, you can now send money to your friends and family using Siri and various payment apps. You can also call a ride or send a message using a third-party messaging app.
Apple has also unveiled a completely redesigned lock screen with a new look for notifications. They can also now display tiny live widgets if you have an iPhone 6s or 7 with 3D Touch. iOS 10 also comes with a huge Photos app update with face recognition, deep learning categorization and intelligent photo albums. Apple Maps, Apple Music, HomeKit and the Phone app are also receiving updates.
Finally, the company is overhauling the Messages app with many, many new features — an emojify feature, message effects, Slack-like feedback on messages, rich link previews and third-party extensions.
While you download the update, why don’t you head over to our review and read about all the new features in iOS 10.

682,Ingrid Lunden,"Evernote — the popular note taking and productivity startup with 200 million users — has built its reputation around an app that lets you record and track all your life’s details hold them there, for life. Today, the company is shifting gears on the question of how it will keep hold of and track that information: Evernote is migrating all of its data, including some 5 billion notes, to Google’s Cloud Platform. As part of that, it will also start to use Google’s machine learning APIs to help access and use that data in different ways.
As a result, Evernote will be shutting down its previous storage architecture that was based around a private cloud infrastructure, along with some of its own tech. Evernote’s new CTO Anirban Kundu told me the first two areas that will be replaced by Google’s machine learning APIs are its voice recognition for speech-to-text translations; and natural language processing, used to help search for contextual content.
Evernote says it will start the migration to Google in early October, with “a complete migration by the end of 2016.”
“The transition to the cloud will occur completely in the background. You should see no impact to your service during the transition, and you do not need to take any action. Behind the scenes, Evernote will become faster, stronger, and more stable,” Evernote writes. It adds that among the security features that it will gain as a result of the change is encryption at rest, which it said many users have asked for in the past.
One thing that it will not gain are ads, Google’s most important business product.
“Google doesn’t get access to the users’ content to make any assumptions or provide any ads,” Kundu said. “Google Cloud Platform is a separate business unit and not interested in monetizing that content. We have no intention of using ads. Our user data is private to them and we protect that in the highest possible way.”
Evernote and Google are not revealing any financial terms of the deal, but Evernote tells me that it considered all of the usual suspects before picking Google. Microsoft might have been an obvious consideration, although it has been making some strong efforts to suck up Evernote users to its One Note platform, so that may understandably have been a bit awkward.
Evernote’s move underscores a change that is underway in the tech world to doing business “in the cloud.” For some that has meant taking data off premises into storage that you access over the Internet. And for others like Evernote, it underscores a shift from trying to build and run your own cloud services to outsourcing and using a larger company’s infrastructure to cut down costs and shift the job of building the infrastructure to keep that information to a larger provider.
“Evernote was a cloud company from the beginning,” the head of Google’s cloud business, Diane Greene, said in an interview today at TC Disrupt, “but when built it it, there wasn’t a place to put that [data] in the public cloud.”
The move also comes at a critical period for Evernote for other reasons.
The eight year-old startup a year ago parted ways with its longtime CEO and figurehead Phil Libin, who was replaced by current CEO, Chris O’Neill (who happens to be a Google alum). At the same time, the company — which has disclosed about $205 million in funding — has faced valuation markdowns from investors as it lost some of its momentum in terms of growth and overall buzz. Something else it has lost is talent, in the form of several departures of other long-standing execs in the wake of Libin’s exit.
Under new leadership, Evernote has started to make some moves to sort out its business. It has brought in new talent, and it has picked up some interesting new investments from strategic backers like Nikkei (one investment reported, and another unreported, from what I understand). It has also firmed up its revenue structure with more expensive pricing plans.
And, notably, it is cutting out some of its unprofitable operations as it repositions itself to grow in a more healthy way.
“There was a lot there that didn’t make sense,” O’Neill admitted to me last week.
This last development — cutting out some of the less efficient efforts of the business — is where the Google news today fits. Evernote describes the move to Google’s platform as a “natural progression for the company.”
As with any outsourcing project, Evernote’s emphasis is on how it can use the change to channel its resources to other areas.
“By moving its data center operations to Google’s cloud, Evernote can focus on its core competency: providing customers with the best experience for taking, organizing, and archiving notes,” the company writes in a blog post.
Evernote is by no means the first company to jump to Google’s Cloud Platform and use its APIs to run its customer-facing technology. Others on the Google Cloud Platform include Snapchat, Spotify, and Viant. Others using its machine learning APIs include Ocado, Wix, and Disney.
But all the same, it’s a big move for a company that has prided itself in years past on being an agnostic and reliable place for your photos, thoughts and documents, no matter what else happens, despite Evernote’s own past security issues.",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/evernote.jpg?w=738,"note-taking,google-cloud-platform,evernote","Evernote is moving all its data, machine learning tech to Google Cloud Platform"
683,Ingrid Lunden,"Razer originally started as a hardware company making mice, keyboards and other peripherals optimised for dedicated computer gaming, with its mantra being “For Gamers, By Gamers.” Now, 18 years into its life, it’s changing things up a bit.
While the company continues to build hardware and its newer software business, Razer is now also announcing zVentures, a new fund of $30 million that the company plans to invest across a wide range of startups in areas like Internet of Things, big data analytics, virtual and augmented reality, robotics and Android games — all areas that Razer is already working on and planning to explore more in the future.
It will also look at startups that are working more behind the scenes but in areas that are also important for Razer as it grows. That includes those who are developing tech for supply chain management, sales and marketing, and more.
“zVentures is a fund for startups, by a startup,” Min-Liang Tan, CEO and co-founder of Razer, said. “Our focus is to bring value by sharing the solutions of our portfolio companies with the Razer community, supporting them with our hardware and software expertise and making available our global retail and distribution networks.” Tan is going to be on stage at TC Disrupt, our conference, later today, where he will talk more about the fund and Razer.
The investments will be focused on early-stage startups, with the size of investment typically ranging from $100,000 to $1 million. zVentures will be based out of San Francisco and Singapore.
The company tells me that there have already been some investments made out of the fund although it’s not yet disclosing them. There are also deals “in the pipeline” in VR, e-commerce and gaming.
The goals here are two-fold for the company: it’s helping Razer support the community around the things that it cares about as a business; and it’s helping to create a funnel of companies that might work closer with it down the line. In other words, it’s similar to many other company’s strategic investment funds, from smaller operations like the Slack Fund through to larger operations like Intel Capital. (Or perhaps more relevant, activities like HTC’s investments into areas of interest like VR.)
With the investments, Razer will also give portfolio companies access to its customer base of 20 million active users who are keen on trying new tech and are loyal to the Razer brand; Razer’s software and hardware expertise; and its distribution network.
We’d been hearing some murmurs about this fund for a while now, although this is the first official news about it. ZVentures is a development on two smaller, $5 million funds that Razer already had. One, revealed earlier this year, is called the OSVR Development Fund. It is being used specifically to invest in startups building open-source VR content for multiple platforms. As with the larger zVentures fund, the idea is to make strategic investments: Razer itself is also building headgear compliant with open source and this is to make sure that there will be a big mix of content being made for it.
The other is another $5 million fund that Razer has been quietly using to advance Android gaming as part of OUYA Publishing, which it picked up in its acquisition of Android gaming console OUYA in 2015. Both of these $5 million funds are now getting rolled into zVentures and the $30 million total, Razer tells me.
While Razer itself is kicking in some money directly to zVentures, there are other backers in it, too, comprised of some of the company’s own investors, the company told me. It wouldn’t specify which of these are involved. To date, Razer has disclosed around $125 million in funding, although as we reported in 2014 there was also a round led by Intel whose size Razer never disclosed (but has confirmed) that catapulted its valuation into the $1 billion range (it’s now valued at more than $1.5 billion). In addition to Intel, its investors include Accel, IDG, Temasek’s Heliconia Capital Management, and China’s LianLuo.",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-12-at-09-05-09.png?w=738,"razer,zventures","Razer launches zVentures, a new $30M fund for IoT, robotics, VR and gaming startups"
684,Darrell Etherington,"Fujifilm is riding high on its strategy of taking camera classics and reinventing them for the modern era, and now it has a new mirrorless medium format camera system that’s likely to win a lot of pseudo-nostalgic interest from photography buffs.
The Fujifilm GFX camera system will debut with the GFX 50S, a mirrorless digital camera with a huge 51.4MP, 43.8×32.9mm sensor, as well as six Fujinon GF Lenses that will be introduced throughout 2017. The camera itself should hit stores beginning in early 2017, too. It’s a big deal because the mirrorless design will help shave a lot of weight and size off the camera body vs. traditional digital and film medium format systems, while also making it possible to create much larger prints from images captured by that huge sensor.
The GFX 50S also has a removable EVF, which can also be adjusted to essentially any angle using an optional adapter accessory, and it also harkens back to its filmic roots with a wide array of physical buttons and dials, much like the other offerings Fuji has put forward in its X-series of mirrorless cameras.

Fuji’s first lenses for the GFX system including a 63mm (50mm equivalent) F2.8, a 32-64mm (25-51mm equivalent) F4, a 120mm (95mm equivalent) F4 Macro with optical image stabilization, a 110mm (87mm equivalent) F2, a 23mm (18mm equivalent) F4 and a 45mm (35mm equivalent) F2.8. All of the initial lenses will be weather resistant for more rugged shooting conditions. All the less also feature an aperture ring, which is another X-series camera carry-over.

685,Devin Coldewey,"Mondays, as we all know, are the worst. That’s why it’s important to keep an eye out for heart-warming videos like puppies sliding on hardwood floors, otters holding hands, or energetic robots doing flips and climbing fences. It helps if, as in this case, the background music is a jam.
The Minitaur started as a research project at the University of Pennsylvania, but the creators have spun off a company, Ghost Robotics, to commercialize the robot. It’s a new approach to robo-locomotion in that its legs are “direct-drive,” meaning there’s no gearing, springs, powered joints, or gearbox in between the electric motor and each leg.


It can trot, run, jump, “pronk,” flip, climb stairs, and is generally more agile than its rigid frame would suggest. Minitaur is also equipped with high-speed cameras and sensors that let it detect its surroundings with great precision. When it jumps up to hit the latch on the door, for instance, that’s no accident.
As Kenneally tells IEEE Spectrum:
Sounds cool, but imagine if you replaced “door handle” with “human neck,” and “leg” with “razor-sharp implement.” Not so cute now, eh?
But those fears are still a long ways off — in the meantime, enjoy this innovative robot platform’s capers and gallivants, and put that backing track on your next mixtape. And if you’re a researcher or robot enthusiast, see about scraping together the $10,000 this thing costs — but expect that price to come down as manufacturing ramps up. That low cost is yet another benefit of eliminating costly extra actuators and gearing.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/ghost-robotics-minitaur.jpg?w=738,"ghost-robotics,robotics,robots","The vivacious, acrobatic Minitaur robot will definitely improve your day"
686,Darrell Etherington,"Facebook has acquired Nascent Objects, a small California startup founded in 2014 that focuses on creating a modular electronics system that consumers could use to build their gadgets, using reconfigurable components including batteries, camera, sensors and more. The startup worked with design firm Ammunition (also responsible for the design of Beats products pre-Apple acquisition) to create its original products prior to being picked up by Facebook.
The so-called “world’s first modular consumer electronics platform” created by Nascent was designed to make it easier for end users without any special electronics manufacturing expertise to design and prototype new products, without incurring too much cost or effort when compared to traditional prototyping methods. It’s kind of like the hardware equivalent of those rapid prototyping software tools you see for quickly mocking up app design and interaction models before they’re coded into fully shipping products.
Facebook’s Regina Dugan, VP of Engineering for Building 8 at Facebook, posted the video below to her FB profile, noting that “[t]ogether, we hope to create hardware at speed that’s more like software.”
Nascent will become part of Facebook’s Building 8 lab, which is focused on rapid prototyping and helping quickly move products from concept to shipping state. Nascent is likely a good fit for this part of the social networking giant’s operations, as it will provide the resources and funding to help expand Objects’ modular system, while also giving it a home where it should be put to fairly consistent use across a range of different types of projects, without the startup having to focus on customer acquisition.
Other initiatives focused on modular consumer electronics that have met with less happy fates include Google’s own Project Ara, which set out to build a user-reconfigurable smartphone, but which was recently suspended by its parent company.

687,Darrell Etherington,"GoPro is revealing many new goodies today, including a few new accessories with run the risk of getting the lost in the noise. They’re actually pretty interesting, though – there’s the Quik Key, a micro-USB card reader that lets you grab pics and video from your GoPro and pop them right onto your phone for sharing and editing; and the REMO, a voice-powered remote control that adds extra range to the built-in voice command features of the new HERO5 camera line, as well as a manual one-button interface.
The Quik Key works with the Quik mobile app, which automatically edits your clips and adds transitions and music, matching the pacing of cuts to the beat of the background tunes. With the Key, you can grab your content easily from the camera’s memory card, and then quickly insert it into your phone to get the clips into the app, where they’re automatically integrated into your video edits. It’s also on a keychain so you don’t lose it, which is good because it’s tiny.
GoPro’s REMO builds on the idea that what you really want to do with your action camera is yell at it, which makes a certain amount of sense because you’re likely going to have your hands full if you’re extreme sportsing (me and Nick Woodman decided this is a real term. Not really but I feel like he’d back it).
Both the Quik Key and the REMO will launch later this year, according to GoPro.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gopro-quikkey.png?w=738,,New GoPro accessories include a smartphone card reader and a voice remote
688,Brian Heater,"GoPro would have been hard-pressed to find a more scenic locale with which to launch its latest offers. Some 2,800 feet above sea level, couched at the feet of the Sierra Nevada mountains that straddle the California/Nevada state line. We’re still several months away from ski season here in the mountains, but the action cam company is clearly lining up the runway in anticipation for the holidays.
All of the pre-event excitement has centered around the company’s long-awaited and much discussed Karma drone, but action cameras have, naturally long been GoPro’s bread and butter – and over the years, the company has more or less become synonymous with the space. And hey, it’s been two years since the company offered a full upgrade to its flagship.

At launch, the Hero5 will be available in two varieties – the Black (priced at $399) and Session ($299), the primary differentiator between the two being a two-inch touchscreen on the back of the former, which brings with it a larger form factor. Otherwise, the two action cameras are pretty similar.
Both versions of the Hero5 feature built-in waterproof casing – making them able to withstand water pressure up to a fairly impressive 10 meters without the need for separate housing. Definitely a welcome addition for extreme sports fanatics. The company is also calling the Session, the “most rugged GoPro yet,” so take that as you will.
The cameras can shoot 4K video at 30 frames a second and 12-megapixel stills (10 for the Session), which auto upload when the camera is in charging mode. There’s voice control built in, supporting seven languages, along with a simplified one-button camera control. Both can do wide-angle photo and video, with the Hero5 Black also able to shoot in RAW.
There’s also active noise cancellation built in, courtesy of three on-board microphones, for “audio that’s as good as the video quality.”
The cameras are compatible with existing mounts and the newly introduced Karma, and the Hero5 sports built-in GPS. All in all, some welcome upgrades, but probably not the revolution GoPro diehards were waiting/hoping for after a two-year wait.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/p91905141.jpg?w=738,,GoPro’s Hero5 Black and Session action cameras are official
689,Matt Burns,"The future of GoPro is not hardware. It’s services.
Editing video is hard but GoPro is moving it to the cloud in a bid to make it a bit easier. The service, called GoPro Plus, is a subscription-based service that GoPro says gives owners access to their photos and videos from any device, and allows for sharing and editing.
This service addresses one of GoPro’s main hurdles: How do you get users to cut down hours of footage into a 2 minute highlight reel? GoPro hopes the answer is in the cloud.
CEO and founder Nick Woodman revealed the company’s cloud ambitions last year. It’s a bold move and building the service was likely a novel challenge for the camera maker. At the time Woodman revealed that GoPro aims to be more than a camera company. It wants to be a lifestyle media company and today’s move is a confident step towards that goal.
Last year I had the chance to sit down with Woodman on the eve of the GoPro Mountain Games in Vail, Colorado. It bothered him GoPro users often leave content sitting on devices. He admitted that he has this problem, too. Like many of his customers (me included), he has stacks of SD cards with footage that he doesn’t have to time to edit. This is where the cloud services come into play.

With this service, when the new Hero5 camera is plugged in to charge, it can automatically upload photos and videos to the user’s account.
GoPro Plus comes with a cost, thought. The service is available through a subscription that also unlocks a 20% discount on mounts and accessories and exclusive access to GoPro apparel. Premium support and access to an extended library of music soundtracks.
The service is $4.99 a month after the expiration of a free trial. GoPro Plus will be available to US customers on October 2nd and additional markets beginning in January 2017.
The press release announcing GoPro Plus states the service is limited to just the GoPro Hero5 line.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gopro-clouds1.jpg?w=738,"nick-woodman,camcorders,3d-imaging,imaging",Cloud video editing could be GoPro’s real hero
690,Haje Jan Kamps,"In launching its Keymission series of cameras, Nikon is bringing the fight to the doorstep of action cameras and VR camera makers. The cameras range from chest-wearable cams, borderline GoPro clones and the most interesting item of the bunch: 360-degree cameras.
It’s an important shift at biannual Photokina photography trade show that is reflecting a rapidly changing photographic landscape. Nikon realizes that its markets are changing; while the company’s traditional bread and butter SLR cameras are still selling well to photojournalists and hard-core photography enthusiasts, sales have gone off a cliff. The problem is that new moms and college students, even if they’re interested in photography, aren’t buying the high-end cameras anymore.
With KeyMission 360, Nikon picks a fight with the action camera market and the 360 degree photography markets. Waterproof to 30 meters, shock proof if it falls from head-height and backed with the Nikon seal of approval, it might just stand a proper chance. The camera shoots 360 video in 4K, which is starting to make the footage interesting for VR use as well.
KeyMission 80 is a curiously designed chest-mountable camera that comes with a magnetic mount for quick access and photography in the moment. It has a front- and a rear facing lens for instant selfies. It’s waterproof and shockproof, of course and is aimed at outdoorsy types who somehow don’t want to take photos with their smartphones… So basically I can’t see anyone buying one, to be honest.
KeyMission 170 is another curious beast and is probably the most direct competitor to GoPro’s range. Waterproof to 10 meters, it can shoot time lapses, 4K video and all the other things you’d expect from an action camera. Basically, it’s a yawn-inducing piece of kit (think GoPro with a Nikon label), but it is interesting for existing in the first place. The camera manufacturer finally admitting that this market is worth investing in is interesting. Nikon taking a leap into the action camera might prove to be too little, too late to take a meaningful bite out of the well-pounded paths of action photography.
All the cameras include Nikon’s SnapBridge tech to make it easy to copy the footage to your smartphone for editing and sharing.
“The pace of innovation in Virtual Reality is challenging the photography industry. We must push the boundaries of quality and speed of sharing,” says Hiroyuki Ikegami, head of Marketing sector for Nikon’s imaging business unit. “For this to be possible, one action camera isn’t enough. To date, action cameras have been aimed at extreme sports, but we believe that the products are great not only for thrill-seekers, but for other users, too.”",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-19-at-7-47-52-am.png?w=738,"photokina-2016,camera,nikon","Launching three new cameras, Nikon plunges deep into VR and action cams"
691,Romain Dillet,"Apple just released not one, not two but three new ads for its new devices — the iPhone 7 and the Apple Watch Series 2. They all tout new features, such as water resistance, low light camera performance and new fitness features.
Let’s start with my favorite one. In “Midnight”, a young man goes for a night ride on his skateboard. He rides in the suburbs, sees a deer (!) at a gas station and ends up at the top of a hill, overseeing the city. It’s beautifully shot.

The second iPhone ad shows a man preparing his bike and iPhone for a ride during an epic rain. He’s using his iPhone with a handlebar mount. I hope he’s not going to die though…

The last ad features the Apple Watch Series 2 and focuses on fitness features. Yes, you can now swim with your Apple Watch, and do all sorts of dangerous sports. With this ad, it’s clear that Apple really wants you to consider the Apple Watch as a fitness-tracking device.

692,John Biggs,"Like most small products with a cult following, SCiO has its fans and detractors. Those detractors took to the Internet recently to complain that the handheld molecular scanner, which raised $2.5 million in 2014, still hasn’t shipped. The result? Negative press and plenty of Tweets.
I asked SCiO’s creator, Dror Sharon, what was going on with the device and when it would ship and, more important, whether it would ever properly scan an M&M.
TC: When are you shipping all the units? 
Dror Sharon: To date we’ve shipped more than 5,000 units and are on track to ship the rest to backers by early next year.
TC: What’s the hold up? 
DS: Since we started manufacturing and assembling SCiO units, we’ve hit several obstacles, including parts that came that didn’t meet our standards. The SCiO sensor is complicated technology and we have a high level of quality control. During the manufacturing process, we also iterated on the design of the SCiO sensor itself. This iteration made SCiO more accurate and more sensitive, and thus required more time to engineer and manufacture.
TC: What would you guys have done differently? 
DS: We have no regrets.
We are building a company, a worldwide developer community and user base, and we are tackling a very complex technological challenge. We understand that there is a small number of community members who are upset with the delays. We take their complaints and comments very seriously and our support team reaches out directly to everyone who comments or asks questions on our Facebook and Twitter channels. In cases where backers have requested refunds, for example, we have fulfilled those requests even though there is no legal requirement for a Kickstarter campaign to provide refunds when requested.
Folks who are upset about delays – we offer them refunds, but the vast majority of them do not take the refund. Most are patient, understand what we are building, and prefer to wait for their unit to arrive. Some of the comments on our FB wall are by people that got refunds or were never part of the SCiO community to begin with.
TC: What can the product scan right now, out of the box? 
DS: Out of the box, SCiO can scan food and pills. There are applets for scanning cheese, yogurt, and other dairy products; fruits, vegetables and fresh produce; and raw chicken, pork, beef and other meats for their nutritional values. It can scan over-the-counter pharmaceutical pills. It can act as a produce selector by measuring the sweetness of tomatoes. There are a number of further apps that are available to backers as beta versions – these are not complete but provide basic functions and a glimpse into the future of SCiO; for example, measuring one’s body fat.
Lastly, users can “teach” SCiO using the Workshop app creator. You scan different materials, press a button, and “presto!”: a machine learning model is created in realtime that can now distinguish between them. It is a bare bones slimmed down version of the full blown SCiO Lab, our development kit. We got really good feedback on this feature, making SCiO fun and educational. It extends the functionality beyond the initial (limited) databases.
TC: When will the device be able to scan an M&M properly? 
DS: We have no plans for candy or M&M specific scanning functionality, other than cocoa levels in chocolate. The pills app is not meant to scan chocolate, the scan was meant as a funny poke. I understand you’re making a joke here. However, we are seriously working on specific apps that solve real-world problems for consumers and industry. For instance, the beta app that can measure body fat percentage with one simple bicep scan. We are working with a number of Fortune 2,000 companies on industrial applications to deploy industrial IoT solutions that address real problems in the areas of agriculture, oil and gas, gemstones, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and much more.
We have several developers working on companies based on the SCiO platform.
Finally, several leading consumer electronics companies are in discussions with us to embed the sensor inside smart consumer appliances. We plan to share more about these development when appropriate to do so.",2016-09-17,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/scio_screencap.jpg?w=738,"consumer-physics,scio,scan","Consumer Physics, creators of the SCiO molecular scanner, respond to Kickstarter claims"
693,John Biggs,"In the world of MAME cabinetry – essentially a subculture of arcade lovers who build amazing cabinets for their emulators – the goal is usually to either recreate the arcade games of yore or build something really wild. Adafruit built something really wild.
Originally a weekend project, this MAME cabinet is a few inches tall and uses a screen about as big as a thumbnail. The kit is far from complete and the screen is too small to be really usable for most games. However with a little downsampling and some judicious game choices you can play some Pac-Man or Dig Dug on this minuscule machine.
The cabinet uses the .96-inch RGB OLED display and a Raspberry Pi Zero. The creator, Phillip Burgess used a tool called Nanoscreen to downsample and display the game frames on the tiny, tiny screen.

Burgess built the cabinet after discussing the idea of a “bonnet” for the Raspberry Pi Zero that fit over and added a great deal of functionality to the bare board. He wrote:
This teeny cabinet is a cool and clever idea, but if you really want to have some fun please consider this Cupcade arcade cabinet instead.

694,Darrell Etherington,"We all suspected the Echo’s purpose was – at least in part – to drive more Amazon sales. And that’s exactly what’s happening, according to a new study by NPD Group. The research company found that owners of the Echo spent around 10 percent more after they bought the voice-powered smart speaker than they did before.
The NPD Group’s Checkout Tracking purchase monitor provided the data, analyzing customer spending and overall number of receipts, and found that there was also a 6 percent bump in the overall number of purchases made by Echo owners on Amazon.com when compared to their pre-Echo existence.
Data for the study came from Echo’s full term of availability, which surprisingly actually spans two years (it feels like it’s been a lot less time to me). NPD also found that about half of the online spending done by Echo owners happens at Amazon.com once they pick up a device.
It’s not a huge deal for other retailers yet because of Echo’s somewhat limited reach thus far – a recent Business Insider article estimates around 1.6 million have sold thus far. But it’s a trend that could be very good for Amazon long-term, especially as it brings the Echo Dot back to market at a new, more affordable price point.",2016-09-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/alexa-family-shot.jpg?w=738,,"Amazon Echo owners spend more on Amazon, says NPD"
695,Devin Coldewey,"The flaming train wreck that is the Galaxy Note 7 recall finally has its official stamp of approval from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and there’s now a hard date for when you can swap your phone for a new one: September 21.
The CPSC previously issued a brief statement saying it was working on an official recall — but that the delay shouldn’t stop users from powering down the affected phones immediately. CPSC chairman Elliot Kaye announced more details today, and said at a press conference that he is “urging all consumers to take advantage of this recall right away.”
The language of the recall notice is similarly forceful. “Consumers should immediately stop using and power down the recalled Galaxy Note7 devices,” it reads. Do not pass go, do not check Instagram. Ninety-two phones have already overheated, resulting in 26 burns and 55 reports of property damage — don’t increment those numbers by failing to heed this advice.
It’s been a protracted process, this recall: Samsung took action directly when reports of combusting phones began to bubble up, first in Korea and then elsewhere; it vacillated on the severity of the problem and eventually announced a full recall of the 2.5 million Note 7s already in the wild (about 1 million are in the U.S.).

It could be that Samsung was working out whether they could get away with simply replacing the batteries in the phones, or whether recalling the entire device was necessary. That would, after all, be much cheaper, and users could keep the phones they’d bought.
The full recall ended up being necessary, of course, and now owners of the devices at least have a date when they can get a new one, if they decide to give the phone — which, other than its habit of burning up now and then, is really quite nice — another shot.
Put your phone’s IMEI or serial number into the box at the official Samsung recall page to make sure you’re affected — ironically, after telling users to power down the phone immediately, the instructions suggest “going to “Apps > Settings > About Phone or General Management > Status > IMEI information or Serial number.” We’d recommend just checking the back of the phone.",2016-09-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/smartphones3.jpg?w=738,"galaxy-note-7,recall",Official CPSC recall goes out for Galaxy Note 7 — replacements will be available September 21

697,Romain Dillet,"The audience at Disrupt got a surprise visit from Boston Dynamics’ Spot robot. While the company’s YouTube channel is quite popular, it’s even more impressive to see one of Boston Robotics’ robots in action.
Boston Dynamics founder and CEO Marc Raibert got interviewed by TechCrunch’s Brian Heater. The two of them spent some time commenting on a video of the company’s various robots over the years, from the BigDog to the anthropomorphic Petman.
The Spot in particular is optimized for home delivery. It looks like a dog, and it can climb stairs, open doors and more. The last couple of generations have been getting smaller and smaller. The SpotMini is a much smaller version of the Spot and was introduced a few months ago. The reason is quite simple — small is beautiful.
“We also want to make our robots friendly,” Raibert said. “Our 250-pound robots — nobody wants to get near them.” The SpotMini robot can walk around tiny apartments. The clamping arm is stabilized like a rooster neck. So you can imagine having a SpotMini delivering a glass of wine without spilling anything. This is probably the closest we’ve come to a robot butler.
“On our YouTube channel, there’s 20 to 1 likes to dislikes. Over the last few years, it’s something like 50 to 1,” Raibert said. “And yet, the media has been relentlessly talking about how terrifying the robots are. There’s a disconnect in my mind.”
The SpotMini’s big brother, the original Spot, walked around the Disrupt stage, stretched its legs, walked sideways, turned around and more. At some point, the robot jumped on two legs and didn’t fall.
When asked about the rumors that Google is looking for an acquirer to sell Boston Dynamics, Raibert didn’t really comment. “I’ve heard the rumors, that’s about all I can say,” he said.
“The thing I said when we got acquired is that DARPA had a big ambition and a lot of resources. And Google has even more ambition and resources,” Raibert said. He even said that Boston Dynamics has more freedom now that it’s part of Google.
So it looks like Raibert wants to prove that the Boston Dynamics products are more than scary military robotic dogs. They can be cute little robots for our homes. Based on the “awwws” in the audience, the cuteness campaign seems to be working.",2016-09-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/disrupt_sf16_boston_dynamics-4318.jpg?w=738,"disrupt,spotmini,spot,boston-dynamics",Boston Dynamics CEO Marc Raibert demos the Spot at Disrupt
698,Sarah Perez,"We already knew it was coming – thanks to an accidental tweet Amazon posted earlier this week – but now it’s official: Amazon’s connected speaker Echo Dot is back in stock and at a lower price point of $49.99. The Alexa-powered device offers many of the same features that you’ll find in its larger counterpart, the Amazon Echo, including access to Amazon’s voice-based assistant who you can ask to do things like play music, read the news, check the weather, turn on your lights, set timers, use apps, and more.
First unveiled in March of this year, the Echo Dot along with Echo Tap, were Amazon’s first attempt at expanding its Echo family of connected speakers by making them available at lower price points.
The Dot in particular came about because many Amazon customers were asking for a way to connect their own speakers to Echo – by doing so, you can enable voice control of your own home entertainment system, or you can use it on its own to talk to Alexa.
The device connects via either Bluetooth or a 3.5 mm stereo cable to your entertainment system, then allows you to use your voice to play music from Amazon Music, Prime Music, Pandora, Spotify, iHeartRadio, TuneIn and others.
In addition, the other big benefit to the Dot is that you can buy multiple devices and place them around the house, so Alexa can respond to whichever device is closest to you. This is an advantage in busy, noisy homes, where kids may be shouting or the TV is blaring. Having more speakers nearby means Alexa can hear you better.
This function is improved with the new Dot thanks to a faster speech processor combined with Dot’s feature called ESP (Echo Spatial Perception). The latter helps the device figure out which Dot is closest to you and should respond to your voice query. Amazon says ESP’s performance will improve over time, so it will resolve the problem of multiple Echo devices answering you simultaneously.
Other than that, Echo Dot is a lot like the larger Echo. It has the same array of seven microphones found in the Echo, and works to control all the same smart home devices that Echo supports.
Before, at $89.99, the Dot wasn’t exactly a no-brainer, and buying more than one would have likely given more budget-conscious shoppers pause.
At $50, price becomes less of a concern.
Amazon is also making the Dot available in discounted packs to encourage buying in bulk. If you buy the six-pack, you’ll effectively be paying for 5 and get 1 free. If you buy the 12-pack, meanwhile, you get 2 free.
The Dot is also now available in either black or white in order to better match the decor of your home, and has a new, more compact design, says Amazon.

699,Matthew Lynley,"For the past two years, Shyp has been ramping up its efforts to appeal to businesses as a go-to, more simplified shipping service. That started off with a big partnership with eBay to help sellers ship their products. And that’s continuing today with a new model for business shipments that caters directly toward sellers looking to move a large number of products.
Starting today, Shyp is rolling out a few updates to its business tools, including lifting the total number of packages businesses can ship when they schedule a pickup. Now businesses can continue to ship their traditional package count — originally capped at 20 — or more than a thousand without having to call multiple couriers.
Business users used to basically set up several accounts and call multiple couriers in order to ship all the products they wanted to ship, Gibbon said. So in a sense, Shyp’s user base was bending the app in order to create a new use case that while painful to execute was still more convenient than traditional shipping methods. And when that happens, it usually means it’s time to call in the product team and figure out how to cater to those customers.
“From our business perspective it’s really, really important to go after a lot of these businesses and scale as they scale their business,” CEO Kevin Gibbon said. “Every business is really different and they are asking for different things. Right now where we’re at, we’re definitely in the lower end of the market. Even 1,000 shipments per month are very low volume, but a lot of businesses are asking for different things. API access, a way to ingest a lot of orders in the same time, a lot of businesses who sell on multiple  platforms. That’s something we’re not great at right now, but that’s something we’re gonna continue focusing on.”
Shyp’s been busy turning around its business in the past few months. From an extensive integration with eBay for sellers, to new packaging pricing and another fee for online returns, the company isn’t just a one-size-fits-all delivery service that charges just $5 per shipment. And that makes sense. Simply making money off the distance between the shipping fee and a bulk volume shipping discount isn’t necessarily enough to make up for a huge variability in kinds of shipments. It doesn’t make sense to charge the same thing to ship a TV as it does for a small gift, for example.
Shyp needs to increasingly cater to businesses. Instead of using the service a few times a year to ship something — like a Christmas gift — that consumers would normally do, businesses can ship hundreds (or thousands, or more) products every month. Getting all those packages at once, in one place, makes it easier to negotiate bulk shipment deals and reduces the logistical overhead to move stuff from A to B. That lowers Shyp’s overall costs, which the company has been trying to do for some time in order to prove it has a sustainable business model.

This all started with a pilot program to help eBay sellers get their products out the door more easily in the company’s core markets. The data it got from that is basically helping the company not only start building programs like this, but also to figure out where to next expand — with Shyp adding 21 new zip codes in its existing markets today. And for many sellers, eBay isn’t the single stop for their customers, so expanding beyond and managing multiple sales channels is going to be increasingly important for a company like Shyp.

Like other startups targeting small businesses, the hope for Shyp is naturally to grow up with the customer. An individual Shopify seller might only ship a few products a month, but if they end up growing into a legitimate large business, that brand loyalty may keep them using Shyp even when they hit thousands of deliveries every month or more.
“You get a customer that’s not worth a lot of money to you initially, but as they scale it can be very meaningful,” Gibbon said. “For us, going after these businesses from a profitability standpoint is just a no-brainer. You’re able to spread a similar labor cost across much more items.",2016-08-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/screen-shot-2015-12-01-at-11-07-38-am1.png?w=738,ups,Shyp’s business efforts ramp up with bulk shipments and new pricing
700,Matthew Lynley,"Here’s a sentence you might not have expected to read: a service built around crowdfunding is building in a one-to-one payments option in what might be one of the most increasingly crowded spaces in the U.S.
That’s what Tilt, an app geared toward crowdfunding events like parties or travel plans, is hoping will make its service even more sticky and a one-stop destination for payments between peers — and build what CEO James Beshara says is a social network around payments. Rather than gun directly for domestic markets (which still account for about half of Tilt’s activity), Tilt is trying to exploit a moment in time where PayPal and other US-based popular payments services — like Venmo — haven’t hit international markets just yet.
The idea of a one-to-one payments product existing within Tilt was kicked around for a while, but never implemented, Beshara said. But when it turned out that international users, like those in the United Kingdom, were basically bending the app in order to essentially enable one-to-one payments, it seemed like there was a potential to implement it as part of the app. Nearly a quarter of all payments activity on Tilt in the United Kingdom was one-to-one payments, despite the app not being geared toward that, Beshara said.
“In our abstinence from it, we’re much more interested in building products that unlock ideas in heads, as opposed to others, which are payments [relating to] the past,” Beshara said. “We were much more in the DNA of future-oriented types of objectives and much more social group minded activities.”
 

One-to-one payments isn’t the core use case of Tilt, nor is it intended to overtake Tilt’s core service as the company’s primary focus, Beshara said. Instead, the metric of success will be whether it makes the app more sticky and whether or not it leads to an increase in the number of funding campaigns that happen. In an initial test, the user base with one-to-one payments enabled increased their Tilt activity by around 34% — which is what the company is hoping will happen to the blanket user base once this is turned on, Beshara said.
Tilt has traditionally been known as being geared toward college students, and that’s largely still the case. 75% of Tilt’s users are either in college or recent graduates, Beshara said, and for that user base it made sense to create a core destination that served both one-to-one payments and group payments activity.
Tilt is closely monitoring its international activity, which accounts for more than half of its activity overall. That was part of a big push the company made starting last year in May when it raised around $30 million at a $400 million valuation. Whenever a user base starts basically inventing a new use case for a service without that being part of the original intent, it makes sense that the creator start paying close attention.

Of course, the analogy of building a social network around payments is an extremely tall order. Basically every network is working to integrate some form of payments, looking to treat the process of exchanging money as a core element of the communications experience. Beshara says that his hope is that people think of Tilt as both a place to not only organize campaigns, but interact with and treat those campaigns as elements of content you might find in the Facebook News Feed, for example.
Building out that big base of content requires users to create that content. And getting users to create that content requires seeding a critical mass of users in order to justify their time to create that kind of content. In order to get people talking in GIFs in a Tilt feed, a lot of people have to be viewing and interacting with that Tilt to start. That’s really what the one-to-one payments tool, which intends to bring in additional users, sets out to do.
“One of the best things we’ve ever done to spur more public participatory discoverable content,” Beshara said. “That’s gonna be the most important thing for us, one-to-one payments in general is notoriously a low margin if any margin business. The only sense for us is does it actually drive the activity and the content that we really want. You come into the platform and see, man, my friends are already using this. It’s very similar to other content creation platform, something like Snapchat — if only 4 of your friends are on it, you’ll be less likely to create content than if 40 friends are on it.”",2016-08-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/finally_its_here_feed_screen.png?w=738,"equity-crowdfunding,tilt,venmo",Tilt dives into one-to-one payments
701,Ingrid Lunden,"Yet one more significant piece of M&A in the online recruitment industry. Today Randstad Holdings, an Amsterdam-based human resources and recruitment specialist, announced that it would acquire job hunting portal Monster Worldwide, for $429 million in cash.
The deal works out to $3.40 per share in cash and is a premium on Monster’s share price at closing on Monday of $262 million. But it is a far cry from the heady days of 2000 — when Monster, which had gone public soon after being founded in 1999 (itself the result of a merger of two early job startups), had a share price of over $91 and a market cap of nearly $8 billion. Even in 2007, when its stock was around $51, Monster was valued as high as $5.5 billion. (Sound familiar? It’s a song that gets played out in many versions.)

It’s still an interesting exit for Monster, which was one of the veterans (and notably, survivors) from the first dot-com boom. It comes amid a spate of M&A activity in the space. Just in June, Monster itself acquired Jobr, a “Tinder for jobs.” And last month, Indeed.com acquired Simply Hired. Indeed itself is owned by Japan’s recruitment and HR giant, Recruit Holdings.
Monster will keep its brand and will operate as a separate entity, but the bigger idea here is to consolidate different aspects of the recruitment and employment industry for better economies of scale and a “portfolio of HR services,” in the words of Randstad.
“In an era of massive technological change, employers are challenged to identify better ways to source and engage talent,” said Jacques van den Broek, CEO of Randstad, in a statement. “With its industry leading technology platform and easy to use digital, social and mobile solutions, Monster is a natural complement to Randstad. The transaction is aligned with our Tech and Touch growth strategy and reflects our commitment to bringing labor supply and demand closer together to better connect the right people to the right jobs. We look forward to welcoming the Monster team and working together to shape the evolving global job industry.”
For Monster, this is an important move to combine with a strategic and adjacent business at a time when companies like Recruit are dwarfing it in the pure-play recruitment space. The company is active in 40 countries, and had around 50,000 employers in its database according to its Q1 report. But in comparison Simply Hired alone (as one Indeed property) covers some 50,000 employers.",2016-08-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/monster-homepage.jpg?w=738,,Randstad buys Monster for $429M as recruitment consolidation continues
702,John Mannes,"Twilio, exceeded revenue expectations in Q2 earnings released today after the bell. Immediately share prices increased in after-hours trading before falling back to the market closing price.
The cloud-communications company reported revenue of $64.5 million and a loss per share of $0.08. Twilio beat revenue by over 10 percent. Analysts had expected a loss of $0.14 per share on revenue of $58.22 million.
Twilio stock was priced at $15 back in June for its IPO. Over the last two months, the company’s shareholders have been treated to a financial all-you-can-eat buffet with shares closing at $42.63 today.
In addition to a beat on revenue, Twilio also announced that it has 30,780 active customer accounts as of June 30, 2016, compared to 21,226 active customer accounts the same time last year.
Twilio issued guidance expectations of between $63 and $65 million Q3 revenue with an accompanying EPS of between $0.09 and $0.10. Yearly guidance signals full 2016 revenue of between $253 and $257 million.
Also in the report, the company touted its new relationship with Facebook offering Messenger platform integration along with an Amazon partnership to deliver SMS messages for AWS’s Simple Notification Service.
Despite pushing its share-price up 184 percent, investors have expressed concerns over revenue concentration. A significant portion of Twilio’s revenue stream lies in the hands of a small number of customers. Moreover, many of the largest customers feeding Twilio have not signed long-term contracts with the company.
To address this, Twilio separated its earnings report into two sections, base revenue and total revenue. Variable accounts are “more likely to have significant fluctuations in usage…from period to period,” according to the company. Twilio services nine variable accounts representing 13 percent of total revenue. WhatsApp accounts for a significant portion of that.
CEO Jeff Lawson stressed that investors can count on growth but shouldn’t expect it to occur linearly, on today’s earnings call.
This quarter, Twilio rolled out add-ons in a marketplace to make it easier for developers to integrate technologies provided by groups like IBM Watson and Wolfram Alpha. Twilio’s Notify and Sync APIs, enable notifications across SMS and better synchronization of mobile and web apps respectively.
New services can only help to grow the Twilio developer community but monetization efforts will be key into Q3 and beyond.

703,Jordan Crook,"The media industry is changing rapidly, and publications are forced to adapt accordingly. That’s where Spectrm, a new Berlin-based startup, comes into play. Spectrm bets big on bots, delivering news content via messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, Slack, and Telegram on behalf of publishers.
Since launch in the summer of 2015, Spectrm has been able to give unique insights to publishing partners, like the fact that content consumers are more likely to engage with content in the middle of the day as opposed to the morning or evening.
Publishers who opt in to the Spectrm experience don’t need any coding experience to start distributing content. Instead, Spectrm offers a CMS interface, letting publishers customize their content for messaging. This includes the ability to add GIFs, videos, and other rich media.
From there, Spectrm’s technology is able to have a conversation with the user, both via responses from the user and their click behavior, to continue serving relevant content at the right time.
Spectrm lets brands market the feature to their own audiences — users can direct message the publisher’s Facebook page, or publishers can add a subscribe button on their own sites.
As you might expect, Spectrm operates under a SaaS model, with publishers paying a base fee of $195/month for access to the platform.
The company is currently in business with more than 50 publishers, including Business Insider, NowThis and German publisher Bild.
There are plenty of products out there that help publishers automate and customize the way their content is shared via social networks, but none have served up tools that suit the more intimate messaging space.

704,Ingrid Lunden,"Google today announced another acquisition that will help the company improve how it competes against Amazon’s AWS, Salesforce and Microsoft in the area of enterprise services, and specifically selling enterprise services in the cloud: it has acquired Orbitera, a startup that developed a platform for buying and selling cloud-based software.
Terms of the deal have not been disclosed but our sources close to the deal tell us it’s just north of $100 million.
This is an acquisition of talent, technology, and existing business. The CEO Marcin Kurc (tellingly) is an alum of AWS. And Google notes that some 60,000 enterprise stacks have already been launched on Orbitera. These include the likes of Adobe, Oracle and Metalogix, who all resell cloud services from third-party vendors as part of their larger enterprise businesses.
“This acquisition will not only improve support of software vendors on Google Cloud Platform but also provides customers with more choice and flexibility in today’s multi-cloud world,” Google said in a statement provided to TechCrunch.
Kurc notes in his announcement that Google will keep everything running as is, “at this time.”
The startup says its focus is on providing four (end-to-end) aspects of building cloud marketplaces: Packaging and Provisioning, Billing and Cost Optimization, Marketplace and Catalogs, Trials and Lead Management.
It looks like Google will continue to operate that business on behalf of existing users, and maybe to help out its own marketplace for cloud services on its own cloud platform.
“Looking to the future, we’re committed to maintaining Orbitera’s neutrality as a platform supporting multi-cloud commerce. We look forward to helping the modern enterprise thrive in a multi-cloud world,” writes Nan Boden, head of global technology partners at Google.
As Google has grown well beyond its earliest roots as a search company, its reached an interesting relationship with companies that are at turns friends and rivals to its own business interests.
Buying a platform company that works with so many of these in the area of cloud services is an interesting development for Google, and one that it’s keen to try to tread carefully in making.
In this case, Google is trying to reassure customers that even as it sells a platform to sell products, it recognises that the ultimate repository of those products might not be Google itself.
(Whether or not that is the case longer term is another question — in other areas like ads, Google has walked an impartial line and then changed course — but for now there is a viable enough business for Google in remaining a neutral party.)
“We recognize that both enterprise customers and ISVs want to be able to use more than one cloud provider and have a way to conduct product trials and proofs of concept before building a full production deployment, all using their trusted SIs (System Integrators), resellers and normal sales cycles,” Boden notes.
“Orbitera has built a strong ecosystem of enterprise software vendors delivering software to multiple clouds. This acquisition will not only improve the support of software vendors on Google Cloud Platform, but reinforces Google’s support for the multi-cloud world. We’re providing customers with more choice and flexibility when it comes to running their cloud environment.”
Orbitera was co-founded by Firas Bushnaq and Brian Singer, who came up with the idea for the company to fix some of the “transactional and operational challenges associated with selling software” that they encountered while founding and working at previous tech companies.
Based out of West Hollywood, CA, Orbitera had raised some $2 million in funding from angels like Hiten Shah and Arjun Sethi, Double M Partners and Resolute.vc.",2016-08-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/industrycloud.jpg?w=738,"enterprise-software,cloud,orbitera","Google buys Orbitera, a platform for cloud marketplaces, for $100M+"
705,Tarun Kalra,"

The path for SaaS domination of a market segment has historically followed one of two routes: bringing previously offline workflows online, or moving on-premise software processes online.
In short, SaaS would take over segments that previously were not SaaSified. As hotbeds of net new SaaS activity consolidate into market winners, widespread innovation within a segment gives way to incremental innovation. The focus of entrepreneurs and investors mostly moves on.
Yet, the current wave of HR SaaS innovators entering the market over the past few years is proving that there can be more to the story even after a segment has been SaaSified. As we assess the market, product, competitive and talent dynamics, we see a perfect storm of enabling characteristics pushing beyond incremental innovation into the widespread disruption of the firmly established HR SaaS category.
We believe HR SaaS is one of the first clear cases of a third, newer path of broad SaaS innovation — next-generation SaaS (SaaS 2.0) disrupting established previous generations of SaaS (SaaS 1.0). HR 2.0’s success, playing out over the coming years, will be a catalyst for increasing entrepreneurial and VC attention into the platform potential of this third path. We will begin to see waves of future SaaS innovation focused on attacking established SaaS categories.
As the poster child for SaaS 2.0, how successful will HR innovators be? Our rough assessment of Next World Capital’s HR Innovators NextScape reveals a few $100 million of the $13-15 billion of annual HR software spend shifting to HR 2.0 innovators in 2016 (see the graphic at the end of the article). Over time, the strengthening force of key enabling dynamics discussed below will enable HR 2.0 innovators to battle for nearly all of the HR software market.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), manufacturing jobs in the U.S. peaked in summer 1977 at 19.5 million, then gradually waned over the next 23 years. Measured by decline in manufacturing employment, the full-scale transition from a goods-centric economy to an information or talent-centric economy occurred over the last decade, with manufacturing jobs dropping below 12 million by 2009 and remaining roughly at these levels today.
Underscoring this shift, the cost of talent per unit of economic output has risen by a factor of nearly 3x from an indexed value below 40 in 1977 to over 110 today, according to Trading Economics. Said another way, the U.S. economy has firmly progressed to an information economy, where talent has replaced goods as the most significant and important determining factor.
The past generation of HR SaaS platforms were all founded before the absolute shift to a talent economy began. They were largely products of a transitional economy where talent was but one piece of the equation.
HR 1.0 placed a premium on administrative versus talent-centric value propositions, i.e. moving offline tasks online, automating processes and delivering compliance. But with the transition to a talent-centric economy, the market now has moved beyond a focus on administration and process. It desires a new breed of HR SaaS, one which aligns business goals with talent versus aligning business goals with process.
A few examples help highlight the shift. HR 1.0 facilitates online application submission, progress tracking and record keeping; HR 2.0 facilitates locating, attracting and hiring the best applicants. HR 1.0 facilitates user-friendly, templated and streamlined performance reviews and company measurements; HR 2.0 focuses on growth, collaboration and goal alignment through review and feedback mechanisms. HR 1.0 enables users to query records and report on KPIs; HR 2.0 enables users to drive decision-making based on past results and, over time, promises to leverage data science and deep learning techniques to recommend, even automate, decision making.
In 2015, millennials became the largest generation in our workforce per BLS. It’s millennials penetrating middle management on their way to upper management, it’s millennials responsible for purchasing decisions and it’s millennials who must be the product focus for software developers. But millennials, the first completely online generation, prioritize specific elements in their software that, coincidentally, are not often focuses within older software offerings.
Clean and performant user experiences, intuitive processes that require little training, mobile-first, collaboration-first, try before you buy/freemium, APIs and integrations, powerful analytics, flexibility/configurability and consumerized interfaces can all be buzzwords that are thrown around when describing software.
But for millennials, many of these traits are table stakes for positive software experiences. HR 2.0 innovators are effectively exploiting perceived weaknesses in 1.0 offerings as millennials look not so much for one single buzzword but rather for an overall software experience with which they relate.
Before SaaS 1.0 arrived, only the most mission-critical client-server software made economic sense for mid-market buyers given the high up-front costs. SaaS 1.0 offerings initially battled in this largely greenfield mid-market. Here, they bulked up with functionality and enterprise chops before eventually moving up weight classes into the enterprise, where client-server offerings dominated. As successful SaaS 1.0 vendors increasingly focus up market, emerging SaaS 2.0 innovators emerge in their wake to take on a somewhat orphaned mid-market.
HR software has followed this playbook with many HR 1.0 platforms almost exclusively focused on the enterprise opportunity. Yet, HR 2.0 innovators enjoy a second beneficial competitive reality. In 2012, the dominant HR 1.0 vendors were acquired — Taleo by Oracle, SuccessFactors by SAP and Kenexa by IBM. As a result, HR 2.0 is stepping into a landscape largely devoid of independent 1.0 vendors.
“No one ever gets fired for buying IBM” is a commonly heard phrase with the general idea being that buying servers, storage or even commodity applications from an established platform company is safe. These technologies are not a competitive differentiator for the buyer’s business, so why take risks on upstarts? HR2.0 aims to flip this script.
HR 2.0 argues that Oracle, SAP and IBM are not a fit in a talent-centric economy precisely because they are not aggressively advancing innovation and differentiation. 2.0 offerings, on the other hand, uniquely enable organizations to attract, hire and maximize talent, a central competitive advantage in today’s economy.
BetterWorks, Checkr, Culture Amp, Greenhouse, Grovo, Gusto, Justworks, Lever, Namely, Reflektive, SmartRecruiters and Zenefits are a few examples of HR 2.0 innovators that received Series A financings between 2012 and 2015. It’s no surprise that these emerging companies, which have forward-looking entrepreneurs and strong VCs, have recently stepped in. Together, the enabling dynamics and entrepreneurial community have converged to usher in the first widespread wave of SaaS 2.0 innovation against an established SaaS category.
At Next World, we actively track 80+ HR SaaS players within our HR Innovators’ NextScape. This NextScape is not exhaustive, but rather focuses exclusively on players that are driving the HR 2.0 wave. We break down the market into the core HR functional areas of talent acquisition, talent maximization and HR administration.
With innovators still commanding a small fraction of HR spend and new market entrants continuously emerging, we are perhaps in the second inning of this wave. Given the sheer breadth of activity, consolidation is inevitable. New market entrants must carefully consider the mission criticality and depth of workflow and use cases that they subsume. However, the foundations are in place for a new breed of enduring HR SaaS platforms. Their continued momentum will bolster the entrepreneurial community’s willingness to attack other established SaaS categories.

706,Matthew Lynley,"Kyna and Conan Fong were at dinner trying to convince their father, who ran a medical practice, to try something different than just keeping paper records.
There’s a good reason for that — they’re slow, they’re hard to transfer and share (often requiring paper delivery or faxes), and there’s a lot of information that can be lost along the way. But despite that being a common issue with many medical practices, there hasn’t been a breakout electronic health records company. In the end, Kyna and Conan Fong convinced their father to experiment.
That’s what Elation Health is trying to break form to do. While other companies like Practice Fusion haven’t been able to unseat more traditional means of keeping patient data or other health records companies, Elation Health is hoping its approach will be able to win over those kinds of doctors and physicians. The company said it raised $15 million in new financing today, led by DFJ.
After a little bit of tooling at their father’s practice, the company arrived on an online-based electronic health records system. The idea would be to remove forms and faxes by being able to share this kind of data online in a private way between patients and interacting physicians.
“At the heart of it is an EHR; it has the entire patient’s record, a longitudinal story of the patient’s health. One, we capture the complete history and story of the patient, and two we enable providers to act upon that information. If they found something in their patient’s record and based on interactions, they may decide on a treatment or oder a lab, give the patient instructions to do exercises at home. We enable specialists to correspond back to the referring physician to tell them what is happening with the patient.”


All this is meant to improve the overall care of patients. With the insurance payments landscape shifting toward incentivizing better care and keeping patients out of the hospital, having this kind of information can provide physicians with ways to create better treatment plans or help patients understand their conditions.
“It’s much more about, hey, what is happening to the patient when they go home,” Fong said. “Are they actually following the care plans we’re outlined. Do they go to the podiatrist when I ask. When I ask my patients to make sure to get their mammograms, do they do that. It’s a much more outward facing patient care focused approach as opposed to transactional documentation tools.”
So, why hasn’t there been a successful startup in this space yet that’s been able to take on larger companies? These systems are very hard to not only spur adoption, but implement. Perhaps Elation Health’s focus on individual practices and physician relationships with patients will help it be successful in areas where Practice Fusion may have stumbled, but we’ll have to see.
“We start with an explicit and intent focused on those patient physicians relationship,” Fong said. “The only way to ultimately improve outcomes and control costs — which is what we’re trying to do in healthcare — is a product that puts the clinical needs first. It’s a very different one than what other companies have taken. Most companies in this space take a very administrative and billing approach.”",2016-08-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/conan_and_kyna.jpg?w=738,"dfj,elation-health,draper-fisher-jurveston",Elation Health receives $15M to take another crack at electronic health records
707,John Mannes,"In a beacon of hope for onlooking founders, Y Combinator reject and network analytics startup Kentik Technologies locked down a $23 million Series B this morning.
Let’s be honest — most of us don’t know anything about network infrastructure. Fortunately for most of us, we can afford not to know. For internet service providers and companies making use of a large number of APIs, being able to quickly receive transparent network information means you have to refresh your Yelp, Box and Pandora accounts fewer times to get what you need.
While it’s easy for us to unplug our routers at the first sign of trouble, most companies have complex server systems where advanced tactics like rebooting and unplugging are often not effective.
Kentik gives companies the infrastructure data they need to detect network attacks, log performance and plan and engineer systems with a time machine feature to see inside the network at various points in history. Companies are handling close to a zettabyte (one trillion gigabytes) of information, and Kentik wants to help customers quickly break some of it into actionable insights.
This logging feature is one of the biggest market differentiators for Kentik. Datadog, one of Kentik’s competitors, raised a $94.5 million Series D back in January of this year.
CEO and co-founder Avi Freedman noted that on a revenue basis, the company is moving past “single digit millions” and into “double digit territory.” Kentik has over 60 customers, and while 80 percent are domestic, the company is developing a strong presence in Western Europe.

That’s not what Satya Nadella means when he uses Minecraft as an example of why LinkedIn was a great acquisition target for Microsoft, speaking to Bloomberg today in an interview reflecting on Microsoft as a company advancing in years.
Here’s the key point Nadella makes in drawing a comparison between the two seemingly disparate acquisitions, which share the distinction of being the two largest deals in terms of dollar value Microsoft has made under his leadership:
It’s an interesting parallel, and possibly the most concise explanation of what sounds like the key deciding factor in both cases. Microsoft sees itself as possessing the platforms that can propel to the next stage companies that still possess growth potential.
Many people have extrapolated that LinkedIn could indeed bring a lot of value as a kind of social network layer woven throughout Office 365 and Microsoft’s other professional cloud offerings, and, indeed, it does make sense that Nadella would see its cloud services as roughly equivalent to what Xbox represents for Mojang’s world builder.

709,Matthew Lynley,"Many executives and employees have need for a role that’s basically a “chief of staff” — someone who keeps track of all the details about everyone they encounter and are headed off to meet in their professional careers. But there’s plenty of information that they might be missing out on, and as you head downstream to smaller companies those roles are just as important but missing. And all that data is basically already out there on the Web in some fashion, if you know the right places to look.
And that’s basically Accompany in a nutshell. After working on Accompany since its launch in 2013, CEO Amy Chang and her team are finally ready to pull the trigger on releasing its relationship management tool into the wild. Accompany finally today launches in an open beta today.
Accompany picks up the information from a user’s email, contacts, social, professional feeds, and calendars in order to build a comprehensive database of all the relevant information to all the people most who are most important to a person’s professional social graph. Think of it as a complete download of everything you know about a person, from public sources to notes you’ve left yourself, delivered to you directly right before you’re ready to get in touch with them.
And when I say a complete download, that’s not a huge understatement. For example, when taking a meeting with someone at a publicly-traded company, you might see the company’s most recent stock price and earnings information, people you know there, board members, nitty gritty about the company and everything in the news related to them. You’ll see some of their social interactions — like activity on Twitter — but it’ll be distilled down from the raw feeds they have to find the most important information.
When meeting someone for the first time, or the first time in a while, having that idle small chat to built rapport is absolutely critical. That’s why having all the relevant information about a person heading into contacting them or taking a meeting is important. That’s also especially true when it comes to business-related meetings where either side is trying to close a transaction. And with all that new information about your contacts coming it, it can help figure out the right moment to reach out and get in touch with someone.
“If one of your friends just announced his product and you’re super excited, and you’re the first to say congratulations I’m so happy for you, that leaves a mark,” Chang said. “There’s a warm fuzzy feeling. That’s a big deal. Kind of want to reach out, you shouldn’t awkwardly out of the blue be like ‘hey do you want to have lunch.’ You can use that as an entry, it takes out that anxiety out. It’s like entering a room of 500 people, you feel anxious walking in, you want to feel prepared.”
There’s an underlying theme to all the work Accompany has done over the past three years of its development. Yes, you read that right: three years. That’s because the problem that Accompany is facing is one of making sense of an immense inbound amount of unstructured data. I’ve experienced this first-hand when poking around in the internals of SEC filings when looking to pull out relevant data for stories about company earnings reports. Accompany also has to constantly add new signals in order to keep up with emerging enterprise tools.
“Some data are more dirty, some are much more user generated, others are official sources like government sources that have been verified,” Chang said. “Depending on the quality of that data and how structured it is we determine how to treat it, and we have to automate that.”
But it’s something that nonetheless is kind of a microcosm of the challenges that Accompany faced when sourcing all the data it does for its pre-meeting briefings. The core problem here is giving not just a complete download, but the right complete download ahead of a meeting or a continuing conversation. If you’re running into a product manager at Amazon, you probably want to know how the company is doing. If it had a crappy earnings report, you might want to tread carefully, and vice versa. You’ll see when the next company earnings call is, in order to keep tabs on what’s going on ahead of a meeting.
“We’ve been testing these signals, sometimes we go aggressive in terms of the number of signals we use, then respond to users by backing it off, then push it more aggressively, then back it off again,” Chang said. “We’re constantly tuning it.”

To say this is a tool that I would be using constantly is an understatement. As a reporter, you are meeting tons of people throughout the course of the day. It can be hard to keep track of everything simultaneously — you want to understand every person’s place in the universe to get all the context relevant to the stories that you’re looking to put together. It’s easy to see the capabilities of something like that expanding to most, if not all, industries.
Accompany isn’t lacking interest in the venture community, either. The company has raised $20.6 million in funding from ICONIQ Capital, CRV and Cowboy Ventures. In 2014, the company raised its last $15 million financing — and despite still being largely under wraps with a small user base, it’s been able to continue working.
There’s plenty of competition coming up for Accompany. This is basically a big point when it comes to customer relationship management software. You can find some similar tools in plugins for things like Gmail. You can also see flashes of interest in an automatic digital assistant, in the form of startups like Clara — which is starting off with a natural language approach to scheduling, but have a natural path to other things like relationship management as they collect more data. There’s a chance that Accompany, spending so long in development, may have missed the boat — and it’s going to depend on the strength of its algorithms to justify its existence.
And there’s plenty more work to do. Chang wants to constantly add new elements, like authored works. That’s the point of bringing it to the world in a beta in order to figure out how people at a much broader scale than its core alpha users have been using it. And we’ll see if there really is room for a full-suite digital “chief of staff” that works well enough to start making the process of meeting and talking to professional contacts more seamless.",2016-08-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/accompany.jpg?w=738,accompany,Accompany’s digital chief-of-staff application launches in beta
710,Matthew Lynley,"It’s an interesting time for Dropbox’s document-building tool, Paper.
Quip, in a similar vein to Paper, was bought for a whopping $750 million by Salesforce earlier this week. This deal surprised a ton of people, but made a lot of sense given that Salesforce has seemingly been dipping its toes into collaboration software. So Quip is a great, and natural, fit for Salesforce and places it in further direct competition with products like Paper.
Dropbox is not only going up against Google Docs, but an increasingly slew of competitors in the collaboration space. Now, it’s hoping to figure out how to further branch its collaborative document-editing tool into the world with a few updates and a new mobile application that’s available today for Android and iOS. There are a bunch of updates to the Paper beta coming today for the Web as well, including enhanced tables, image galleries, and notifications across multiple devices.

It’s natural that tools for Paper to exist. Rather than trading around information, documents and embedded content like photos or tables it’s easier for them all to exist in one place where anyone can edit the documents. It’s part of the reason tools like Google Docs have become so popular and have seen so much investment.
Paper essentially exists as a document that’s supposed to naturally evolve with a few core types of embeds over time. Users can create checklists, embed tables and photo galleries, and of course comment throughout. These kinds of tools hit all the right pain points for companies that are looking to synchronize information across multiple teams and develop their plans and products over time.
The app isn’t just a slimmed down version of a document editor. Instead, it’s designed to be an extension of the things that happen in the Web document editing tool. Users will be able to see comments and reply to them, view their notifications and documents and make small changes on the go, among other tools. It’s not supposed to completely emulate the experience, which certainly wouldn’t work on a smaller screen.
Instead of feature creeping Paper right from the get-go, there was plenty that didn’t make it into Paper, Radhakrishnan said. Some interesting user behavior popped up in the process, like design firms using it to keep track over time of the changes they’d made to several designs. So there’s a lot of flexibility for a tool like this, Radhakrishnan said. There’s a potential opportunity to open up Paper to developers, but right now Dropbox wanted to stick to the basics, she said.
One thing Radhakrishnan stressed throughout the conversation was that the features that made it into Paper was a constant result of user testing. Such a data-driven approach is common in larger companies, and it’s not surprising that Dropbox would take such a rigorous approach to enterprise tools. Releasing new beta tools and applications gives Dropbox an increasing ability to figure out what new user behavior pops up that it can account for.
As Dropbox has continued to grow up, it’s had to evolve its strategy in order to compete with larger enterprise services. Over time, its core cloud storage product — designed to be dead simple in order to attract and keep ahold of its users — has slowly become commoditized by huge incumbents like Apple and Alphabet. There’s always the chance that Alphabet and Apple could pull the trigger on new features and pricing models that would capture a large swath of Dropbox’s paying customers.
So it’s had to find a new way to bring in paying customers, and a big part of that focus has been finding and attracting large enterprise clients. For example, Dropbox recently released a tool that would allow companies to literally scan and edit documents in the real world using advanced character recognition tools. New tools like that, and updates to Paper, are critical to not only attract new business customers but retain its 200,000 paying enterprise customers.
The competition is, of course, fierce. It’s going up against companies that have prioritized enterprise from the get-go like Box. It has to deal with the constant threat of companies like Microsoft with their Office 365 tools. Dropbox’s pitch has always been that it’s a much simpler product with a cleaner interface, but it has to make sure it gets all the right tools in its enterprise products to back up that pitch.
Its registered user base is quite large at 500 million registered users (though it’s not immediately clear how active that user base is). But times and ecosystems change, and new updates and tools like the Paper mobile application are ways to figure out how to figure out what Dropbox looks like within larger companies outside of just standard file storage and sharing.
“As the world today changes, more and more collaboration is happening online, but there is a lot of collaboration that happens on the file system,” Radhakrishnan said. “One is, we’re very simple user interface and that’s our link to Dropbox users — that as a philosophy we want to continue through Paper as well. We went through every feature we want to add a million times and make sure it works in the simplest way possible. That will continue, there’s no way that won’t happen.”",2016-08-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/dropbox-paper-beta.png?w=738,"quip,paper",Dropbox launches an iPhone and Android version of its document-editing app Paper
711,Lora Kolodny,"An Altanta-based startup called Florence Healthcare has raised $1.7 million in seed funding to help drug companies and researchers at hospitals or other trial sites to exchange information about clinical trials in the cloud.
Ultimately, helping these groups share information with each other, and with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, could speed up the time it takes to get much-needed treatments to the sick people who need them, said Florence Healthcare CEO and founder Ryan Jones.
Changing what has been a whiteboard and paper process into a digital one could also save the pharma industry time and money.
“Every year, the pharmaceuticals industry spends about $10 billion on just visiting trial sites, bundling up paper documents and scanning them to prepare them for the F.D.A.,” Jones said.
Florence Healthcare built its software to feel natural for researchers accustomed to jotting things down, circling things on paper, and generating medical records and lab reports as they treat their patients offline.
In recent years, the CEO also noted, breakthroughs in biotech have led to a spike in the workload at research institutions, or “trial sites,” that conduct clinical trials to understand a new drug’s efficacy and safety.
Prior to starting the company in 2014, Jones was President of a content search venture called Pubget, acquired by the Copyright Clearance Center Inc. in 2012. The company helped huge pharma companies access published, scientific papers from more than 600 medical centers, among other things.
Bee Partners led the seed investment in Florence Healthcare, joined by Bessemer Venture Partners, Dartmouth alumni’s Green D fund, and Fitbit’s Vice President of Engineering, Will Crawford.
Founding Partner and Managing Director at Bee, Michael Berolzheimer, noted that Florence Healthcare has timed its entrance in the market well.
By May 2017, the F.D.A. will require companies to keep and submit data about their clinical trials digitally, not on paper.
The investor said Florence Healthcare should use its seed funding to increase adoption of its “vertical workflow software,” called the Florence eBinder Suite, and to continue to make sure that everyone from administrators to the leaders of clinical investigations find it easy to use.
Berolzheimer also said, “Longer term, Florence Healthcare could identify new ways to provide data and services to everyone in this value chain. They could potentially support the FDA, and drug discovery further upstream.”
Florence’s users already include institutions sought after by drug and device developers including UCSF Mt. Sinai, and Sloan Kettering’s PCCTC Cancer Research Center.",2016-08-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/2016-07-27-2.jpg?w=738,"green-d,bvp,bee-partners,florence-healthcare","Florence Healthcare raises $1.7 million to move clinical trials research off paper, into the cloud"
712,Ron Miller,"Ping Identity announced its first acquisition since being acquired by Vista Equity Partners in June for $600 million, grabbing Austin-based UnboundID for an undisclosed purchase price.
The purchase, which Ping CEO Andre Durand says wouldn’t have been possible before the acquisition, expands his company’s mission beyond protecting pure business identity to customer identity and all that entails. Perhaps more importantly, UboundID also gives Ping its own identity data store, a foundational piece for its identity platform.
“The folks that have built Unbound ID have been around and understand how to build incredible user and profile systems. You can call it a directory or repository where people store user profiles and privacy preferences. At the end of the day, UnboundID has one of the world’s best customer-facing user directories,” Durand told TechCrunch.
He said it wasn’t a coincidence that this was the first purchase. Ping and UnboundID have been partners for several years, but he said there’s only so much innovation you can do as partners.
“Once we incorporate this into our platform and have capabilities to store user profiles, it allows us to innovate in ways we couldn’t before,” he said. That could involve finding better ways acquire, retain and engage with customers directly through the digital channel, he explained.
That platform idea is one that attracted Vista to Ping in the first place, and this acquisition provides a first step in expanding beyond pure business identity management, where Ping has lived for the last decade.
Martin Kuppinger, an analyst at KuppingerCole, a firm that covers identity, sees this as a logical first deal for Ping.
“From a feature perspective, there is little overlap, thus it expands the Ping Identity capabilities. From a strategy perspective, it fits into the emerging market of customer identity management (CIAM – Customer Identity & Access Management). From an execution perspective, there are already joint customers from the existing partnership” Kuppinger told TechCrunch by email.
He says this deal also puts Ping firmly at the intersection of identity and and customer engagement and management, a central place to be these days as companies strive to understand their customers better.
“These technologies are a counterpart to CRM (with its sales perspective) and marketing automation. In the area of consumer/customer identity, Ping Identity takes a very strong position after this acquisition,” he said.
UnboundID’s repository is also built for scale, meaning instead of hundreds or thousands of entries, it could support tens or even hundreds of millions. Durand sees kind of ability to expand opens up all kind of future possibilities, including Internet of Things devices.
Identity has up until now provided access to applications regardless of where they happen to be installed — inside companies, in the cloud or on a mobile device. Durand sees the next logical step will be having sensors connected to these applications, and that will provide a whole new set of authentication challenges.
“Every device or sensor has an owner or administrator, and we have to connect to the correct owners to protect these devices and information coming from them,” he said.
But that’s a use case for down the road. For now, he says it’s about understanding customer behavior and really knowing when to engage with the customer at the right time, with right message and the right privacy and user settings.
“That’s the intersection of where UnboundID fits,” he says.",2016-08-02,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-10189535.jpg?w=738,"andre-durand,vista-equity-partners,ping-identity",Ping Identity expands mission to customers with UnboundID acquisition
713,Ron Miller,"Distil Networks, a company that helps discover and eradicate bad bots, announced a $21 million Series C round today.
Funders include new investor Silicon Valley Bank along with previous participants Bessemer Venture Partners, Foundry Group and TechStars. It comes on the heels of another $21 million round in June, 2015 and brings the total raised to $65 million across all rounds.
With the funding environment growing ever uncertain, especially as we approach the November US presidential election, Distil CEO Rami Essaid admitted that his company didn’t necessarily need the money, but wanted to grab it while the getting was good.
Essaid was particularly pleased about having a strategic partner like Silicon Valley Bank in this deal as his company targets banks as a key customer demographic. He’s hoping the relationship will give them entree into other financial institutions, which tend to gravitate toward security products that have been vetted by other banks.
Investor David Cowan from Bessemer Venture Partners told TechCrunch after the June, 2015 funding round that going after bots is a crucial piece of any company’s security plan.  “Eliminating bots from network traffic provides a foundation of cyber security that eliminates entire classes of attack,” he said at the time.
Essaid indicated this round should be the last one his company takes as he aims to get off the private fundraising hamster wheel and run his company the old-fashioned way — by making a profit.
“We want to be in control of our fate. We’re done with fundraising. We’ve set aside some funds for a strategic acquisition and set an operating plan to get to profitability [by the end of next year],” he explained.
He sees that goal separating Distil from many startups out there who are investing in growth at the expense profitability. “That doesn’t make sense. We’re investing in growth [too], but seeing the light where we can [also] be profitable,” he said.
To prove his point, he says that the company has over 400 customers and has been growing quickly with 2.5 x revenue growth per year. It began the year with 100 employees and is looking to double that by year’s end. With 150 currently on the books, it’s on the way to achieving that goal.",2016-08-02,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-480798100.jpg?w=738,"bot-detection,distil-networks",Distil scores $21 million Series C to crush bad bots
714,Ingrid Lunden,"Salesforce is continuing its buying spree to expand the kinds of cloud-based apps and services that it offers to its customers beyond basic CRM. The company has just announced that it is acquiring Quip, the cloud-based word processing app that was co-founded by Bret Taylor, formerly CTO of Facebook. We understand from two sources very close to the deal that the total price is $750 million.
That includes cash and shares, as Salesforce’s 8-K that it just filed on the deal notes “Quip capital stock with an aggregate value of approximately $582 million not including consideration attributable to Salesforce Ventures’ existing investment in Quip.”

In a blog post announcing the news, Quip notes that it will continue to operate its business, but now under Salesforce. We understand that Taylor and his co-founder, ex-Googler Kevin Gibbs, will both be staying on post-acquisition.
“We’re inspired by the possibilities ahead of us. As part of Salesforce, we will be able to expand our service more quickly and reach millions of people all over the world — which has been our mission since day one,” they write. “And, we’ll be able to extend the Salesforce Customer Success Platform in powerful new ways with our next-generation productivity capabilities. The possibilities of mixing data, content and communication are amazing.”
It’s not clear why Quip — which was growing and in the enviable position of being very selective about taking funding from VCs — decided to sell up to Salesforce. But it’s an interesting turn in the ongoing consolidation that we’ve seen in the enterprise market, and how that is transforming the bigger companies that are doing the buying.
Salesforce, as we now know, had tried to acquire LinkedIn earlier this year before the social networking company made the $26 billion jump into the arms of Microsoft. While Salesforce and Microsoft sometimes work together, they also compete, and adding Quip into the mix at Salesforce could one way for Salesforce to do that better (and counterbalance the fact that Microsoft is building and acquiring more products that compete with Salesforce on the CRM front).
Quip, when it first launched as a mobile-only native app (it now has a desktop and web version), was described by my colleague Josh as a timely disruptor to the clumsy and very incumbent Microsoft Word.
Salesforce could do enough just to offer this, as it is, as part of its wider portfolio of productivity services to tempt more customers to its platform, and away from Microsoft’s. But considering the price that it is paying, and the fact that the Quip team is joining as part of the deal, I suspect they could be aiming to do something even bigger.
(Whether or not it will work is another question: one sticky point with Salesforce has been how the company integrates acquisitions. They are often bolted on, rather than truly brought together, is how it’s been described to me, so it will be worth watching to see how Quip fares on that front.)
In any case, Taylor has had a pretty eventful summer. Quip’s acquisition comes about a month after he joined the board of Twitter.",2016-08-01,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/quip-screen.png?w=738,"productivity,word-processing,quip",Salesforce buys word processing app Quip for $750M
715,Ingrid Lunden,"Hot off the heels of its acquisition of Yahoo last week for $4.8 billion, today Verizon announced another huge purchase: it’s buying Fleetmatics, a telematics company based out of Dublin, Ireland, for $2.4 billion in cash, to build out the products that it offers to enterprises in the areas of logistics and workforces that are on the move.
The deal will make Fleetmatics a part of Verizon Telematics, a subsidiary of the telco that focuses on fleet management, mobile workforce solutions and IoT. It’s part of a short spate of acquisitions that Verizon has been making lately to expand those operations: about six weeks ago, Verizon Telematics announced that it would acquire Telogis (financial terms undisclosed).
More generally, the acquisition of Fleetmatics points to ways that Verizon is continuing to use its balance sheet to finance investments into newer areas to offset continuing declines in its core, legacy business of basic phone services. As that market has become increasingly commoditized and people turn to other, digitised forms of communication away from traditional voice services, Verizon is hoping to invest into newer areas to move beyond “dumb pipe” status to keep its margins up, and revenues growing.
While its acquisition of AOL (and now Yahoo) will help Verizon scale up its media, advertising and content operations, Fleetmatics is pointing straight to Verizon’s ambitions in enterprise services, and specifically enterprise mobility.
The wider context of that market is interesting.
On one hand, there are traditional customers for these services: companies that employ fleets of workers who are constantly on the move as part of the companies’ wider operations (Fleetmatics’ existing customers include businesses like Time Warner Cable and DirecTV).
The boom in smartphone services and enterprise mobility has given this customer base a wider range of tools to do these jobs better, and Verizon wants to be their go-to for purchasing them.
On the other, there is a growing new market, too: companies like Uber have been investing a lot to build out a logistics business that goes beyond the transportation of people, and there are a number of other startups (and much larger players, like Amazon) that are hoping to disrupt more traditional providers of services to move things from points A to B. Verizon is buying into the technology used for these services as well, as another way to increase the revenues it makes from enterprises, beyond basic network connectivity.
Fleetmatics is an SaaS-based provider of GPS and other services to fleets and companies with mobile workforces. It has 37,000 customers, 737,000 subscribers and 1,200 employees. The services that it offers include location services, driver and car security services, fuel tracking, dispatching and billing/invoice services.
The company has been publicly traded since 2012 and the deal is equivalent to $60 per share in cash, Verizon said. When it was private, Fleetmatics had raised over $93 million from investors like IVP.
Verizon Telematics CEO Andres Irlando says the deal was done to build up its telematics services for small and medium businesses.
“Fleetmatics is a market leader in North America — and increasingly internationally — and they’ve developed a wide-range of compelling SaaS-based products and solutions for small- and medium-sized businesses,” he said in a statement. We will be talking with him later and will ask if there are more deals of this kind to come.",2016-08-01,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/shutterstock_427490584.jpg?w=738,"logistics,telematics,fleetmatics,verizon",Verizon buys Fleetmatics for $2.4B in cash to step up in telematics
716,Lora Kolodny,"A startup that helps businesses determine when drones are flying unwantedly or otherwise into their airspace, Dedrone, has partnered with the electronics division of civil aircraft manufacturers Airbus to bring drone detection to wide open spaces and remote locations.
Through their partnership, Dedrone will integrate Airbus’s long range radar technology into its systems which are comprised of ground-based sensors and data analytics and reporting software in the cloud.
The radar (and data from it) expands the range of the startup’s drone detection systems to a radius of up to 3 kilometers in open spaces, according to Dedrone CEO Joerg Lamprecht.
Dedrone’s standard hardware is more for distributed use. The sensors are set up all around data centers which are often surrounded by trees, embassies, corporate campuses, or stadiums where a small drone could fly not just overhead but indoors and near windows attempting to capture images or hack into internal systems.
But if a business owns and operates something like an airport, water treatment facility, nuclear power plant, or test tracks where new vehicles are driven and safety-tested, Dedrone hardware with long-range communication capabilities via Airbus radar could allow a more centralized set up.
Lamprecht noted, “We have always integrated the best available technology on the market into our systems. We have had surveillance cameras, mics, frequency scanners and now we have the power of the Airbus radar, which will allow us to reach into new industries.”
Dedrone focuses on drone detection and monitoring, not counter measures to bring unmanned aerial vehicles down, or block them from entering a particular space.
Opening up its systems, and integrating with new hardware and data sources like those from Airbus, allows Dedrone to work increasingly in conjunction with other physical and aerial security systems, for example, jamming units that could force a drone to land before crashing into critical infrastructure.",2016-07-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/flughafen_hr_dedrone.jpg?w=738,"uavs,drones,airbus,dedrone",Dedrone partners with Airbus to bring drone detection to wide open spaces including airports
717,Josh Constine,"“What if I figured out a way to take Facebook from 2004 and bring it to 2016? What if every field in your profile was a full video?” asks Facebook’s 19-year-old product prodigy Michael Sayman.
The answer is Lifestage, a standalone iOS app for people 21 and under, which Facebook is launching today. It asks for your happy face, sad face, likes, dislikes, best friend, the way you dance and more, but instead of filling in this biography quiz with text, you shoot videos. Lifestage turns those clips you recorded into a video profile others can watch.
While technically anyone can download Lifestage, anyone 22 or older will only be able to see their own profile. That’s because it’s built for high-schoolers to learn more about their classmates. A quick swipe lets you block and report people, too, in case anyone sketchy tries to creep on the kids.

When you sign up, with no need for a Facebook account, you select your high school, and will then see the video profiles from people at your school or ones nearby. And for added virality, Lifestage only shows you other people once 20 people from your school are using it. That way, you nag your friends to join. In that way, it mimics the way Facebook was originally launched — school by school — because social apps are no fun if you don’t know anyone using them.
Sayman isn’t another 30-year-old product manager from an elite college. His parents from Peru and Bolivia raised him in Miami. There he taught himself to code at age 13 with tutorials he found on Google. His first product, a $1 app with tips for the Club Penguin game, earned thousands of dollars. That money helped his family stay afloat during the recession after their house was foreclosed upon. You can read about his journey in Carmel DeAmicis’ profile of Sayman.

By then the app was overloading the free tier of Parse, the Facebook-owned mobile backend hosting service. Sayman negotiated a massive discount that let him keep operating 4Snaps. But Mark Zuckerberg ended up inviting Sayman to come visit Facebook, create a special presentation for its F8 conference and eventually intern there.
He’s spent the last two years getting acquainted with the social network and coming up with the idea for Lifestage. “I wanted to work on an app that my demographic would relate to, or at least that my friends would want to use.” Along with a team of three engineers and one design contractor, Sayman is now ready to ship his brainchild.
To build Lifestage, Sayman tells me “I went back and looked at Facebook from 2004. At the time I was in second grade.” Thanks for making the rest of us feel old, kid. Back then, Facebook opened to your own profile, not the News Feed. Lifestage works similarly. You’ll see a bunch of bio questions you can answer with videos. The more you fill in, the more questions are unlocked.
In the feed you’ll see people from your school who have recently updated their profiles, which you can tap through to see specific answers, or swipe through to skip to different sections. To instill some gamification, people get ranked with higher levels if they’ve added more to their profile. You’ll also see a sunglasses-smile emoji by people who recently updated, while those who’ve let their profiles languish will show a frown or even the poop emoji.
There’s no way to contact people directly in Lifestage, since Sayman explains “my friends and I have a bajillion messaging apps we already use and love, so what’s the point of having another messaging app? It just seems annoying to me.” Instead, each users gets a “Reach Me” line of text that appears beneath their name, which could be used to show off their Snapchat or Instagram handle, or another piece of contact info.
Lifestage could capture the attention of teens that Facebook fears might slip away to Snapchat. When asked about Snapchat, Sayman said “I think of it like really great competition. They’ve got a great product and there’s a lot to learn…about how people have started to evolve the video space.” That said, he does note that his Instagram Stories are getting more than his posts on Snapchat.
The worry for Lifestage is that Facebook has a poor track record with standalone apps, having shut down Poke, Slingshot, Paper and Notify. Facebook clearly doesn’t see it derailing Snapchat, because Lifestage’s promotional materials include Reach Me text like “Snapchat me.” Oh, and Facebook launched it on a Friday afternoon, the least-read time for blogs. It’s almost like it’s not supposed to succeed on its own.
Instead, Lifestage could teach Facebook how to improve its profiles with video, as Mark Zuckerberg wants “video at the heart of all our apps and services.” Facebook launched profile picture videos at F8, but they don’t seem all that popular yet.
Lifestage takes an innovative stance. You could say your dog is your favorite pet, you love Radiohead or that this is who you’re dating. But with videos, those aren’t lines of generic text. They’re totally unique videos that truly tell the story of who you are. That same idea could make Facebook seem fresh, even if it’s almost as old as the kids Lifestage was built for.",2016-08-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/facebook-lightstage.png?w=738,teens,Facebook’s new teens-only app Lifestage turns bios into video profiles
718,Romain Dillet,"Twitter just unveiled a new feature that will let everyone filter low quality notifications from bots and spammers. Twitter has had bullying issues in the past, and the company is now taking actions to make it a more welcoming place.
Twitter is wording this new quality filter as a tool to hide notifications from bots and duplicate tweets from spammers. But it could also be a way to prevent harassment from Twitter trolls before making a decision on an account ban.
If you want to activate this new filter, go to the Notifications tab in the Twitter mobile app, hit the Settings button and turn on “Quality filter.”
The company doesn’t say much about the algorithm behind this filter. “When turned on, the filter can improve the quality of Tweets you see by using a variety of signals, such as account origin and behavior,” Emil Leong wrote on the Twitter blog. This filter won’t affect your timeline as you’ve chosen to follow the people who appear in your timeline. Similarly, you’ll get notifications from people you follow or people you’ve recently interacted with.

Today we learned that Twitter has added an additional 235,000 suspensions, bringing their two-year total to 360,000 accounts.
By Twitter’s own admission, quickly identifying accounts promoting terrorism can be a challenge, but the company reports that daily suspensions are up over 80 percent in the last year. The company also noted that suspensions tend to spike in the days immediately following major terror attacks.
Identifying behavioral patterns and implementing proprietary spam fighting tools have enabled the company to sharpen its response time, and ultimately Daesh traffic on Twitter has plummeted by 45 percent in the last two years. While algorithmic techniques account for approximately one-third of account detections, the other two-thirds is a product of around the clock efforts from dedicated Twitter teams.

720,Josh Constine,"Facebook may try to compete with Steam, or at least win back revenue lost when casual gaming shifted to mobile. Today Facebook formally announced it’s working with game engine Unity to build a dedicated, downloadable desktop gaming platform, plus it’s broadening the Facebook.com experience for gamers.
Both will allow publishers to offer their iOS and Android games on desktop in addition to the casual games Facebook is known for, while the desktop PC app could support more hardcore games.

Starting today, game developers can apply until August 31st for instant access to a limited alpha of a version of Unity 5.4 that will allow them to build and export games to Facebook’s website and desktop app. “Integrating tools that provide effortless access to Facebook’s network is a key part of helping developers find the success they deserve” says Unity’s VP of biz dev Elliot Solomon,
Previously, Unity developers had to work with a more code-intensive Facebook SDK to bring games to its web platform. Facebook already partnered with Unity to support Oculus VR game development.
Facebook was once the home for social gaming, earning a peak of $257 million in payment taxes in Q4 2014. That’s slipped to $197 million last quarter as gamers moved to mobile app stores. But Facebook still has 650 million users who play games each month. It’s paid out over $8 billion to game developers since 2010, and $2.5 billion in 2015 alone.

The new and revamped Facebook gaming platforms could restrengthen the social network’s control over a huge part of how people use the internet.
Facebook first announced its foray into a downloadable desktop platform in May. It was calling the test the “Facebook Games Arcade” though the company has ditched that name and now just refers to it as the “new Facebook PC gaming platform”. You can watch a demo of Facebook Games Arcade here:

Facebook was apprehensive to reveal details about the specs and plans for the PC platform, but here’s what we know from talking with Facebook and Unity:

Facebook’s enhanced web and new PC platform could allow it to compete with Valve’s Steam marketplace. Though Facebook might start by focusing on more casual titles rather than the big console blockbusters, it could move in that direction eventually.
While Steam has over 125 million monthly users, Facebook could attract developers with its massive user count. If Facebook and Unity can make it simple to port games to Facebook’s platforms without a bunch of extra coding, devs might as well gain some extra exposure. Facebook’s Oculus Home is already competing with Steam.
Meanwhile, these platforms’ support for mobile could allow Facebook to earn taxes on mobile games without owning its own mobile operating system. It once tried a different approach, building an HTML5 mobile web gaming platform called Project Spartan to sidestep the iOS App Store and Android’s Google Play. But developers dismissed it as underpowered compared to the native operating systems.

Facebook is on a quest to eat the internet. Feeds, messaging, video, live streaming, news, commerce, payments — Facebook wants a piece of everything you do online. It can’t make the world more open and connected if it isn’t connected to every way you…connect. As gaming grows as a behavior, Facebook can’t sit back and let Apple Google, Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo own it.
The Oculus acquisition was a big step back into gaming through VR. Still, most of us spend our days not in a headset but in front of a glowing rectangle. Facebook won at online gaming years ago. The company proved it’s not afraid to be the underdog, challenging YouTube for video. Now it’s time to hit “Continue” on Facebook Gaming.",2016-08-18,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/facebook-games.png?w=738,"valve,steam,unity",Facebook is building its own Steam-style desktop gaming platform with Unity
721,Anthony Ha,"Blockai is supposed to help photographers and artists defend their intellectual property. Now it’s launching a new feature to make that process easier — or at least better-integrated with Twitter.
Previously, Blockai users would go to the startup’s website to upload their work, creating a record in a public database (namely, the blockchain) stating that they’re the creator.
However, CEO Nathan Lands said, “We don’t imagine artists are sitting on Blockai all day,” so it’s also trying to integrate with other tools, starting with Twitter. Just tweet the image that you want to register and include the hashtag #blockai; the image will automatically be registered (assuming you’ve already got a Blockai account — otherwise it’ll ask you to set one up).

As Lands explained when the service first launched, the idea is to offer users a way to create proof of their copyright without going through the trouble of registering with the Library of Congress.

The service is free for artists to use. The plan, eventually, is to charge other customers, such as media companies.
The ultimate goal, Lands added, is “to answer, for every file on the web: Who owns the copyright?”",2016-08-17,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/blockai-homepage.png?w=688,"copyright,blockchain",Blockai’s new tool combines tweeting and claiming copyright
722,Fitz Tepper,"Over the past year Instagram has been working to reinvigorate the Explore tab, which is the app’s place for showing you personalized content. What started as a simple algorithm to determine photos you may enjoy has evolved into a full-fledged discovery platform to show you photos and videos that will want to make you spend more time in the app.
A major part off this initiative was Instagram’s “Picked For You” feature, which put 20 custom channels inside Explore based on topics Instagram thought you’re interested in. And while these channels could be entertaining, most of the content was evergreen and not based on a time-sensitive current event like a concert or sporting event, both of which are extremely popular types of content on social media in general.

So today Instagram is launching a new video channel within Explore called Events.
The channel will be personalized for each user and feature videos from concerts, sports games, and other live events depending on what’s happening around the world, what types of live events users are interested in, and what type of accounts the user follows.
Any real-life event can become an event inside Explore as long as it’s popular enough amongst users and there is enough content to create a channel.
Like other explore channels, content will be sourced from users (who take video and tag it with the event location), meaning the video you take of your favorite band could be featured to users around the world.
Customized event channels seem like a great way for Instagram to compete with Snapchat’s discover channels, which also features curated users-generated videos from major events around the world.
But because Snapchat’s discover channels are still curated by hand, there’s a limit to how personalized the channels can be.
For example, a Snapchat channel on Coachella definitely isn’t interesting to every user on the platform. But if Instagram can show a Coachella channel specifically to people who follow music festival accounts they will have a much better shot at actually getting those people to spend time watching the content.
Events will launch today in the U.S for now, and should roll out to users in other countries soon.",2016-08-17,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-463068123.jpg?w=738,"social-media,events,instagram-video",Instagram adds an Events channel to show you the best videos from concerts and sporting events
723,Josh Constine,"Big purchases are scary to make online without anyone there to quell your fears and answer questions. Operator’s app wants to give you the same peace of mind, not with mechanical chat bot responses, but through real humans with knowledge about whatever you’re buying.
Today Operator 2.0 launches with a new Discovery tab where curators assemble recommendations about their favorite products in a category, and can offer guidance about which to get. That said, bots will still help handle mundane interactions to free up experts for more subjective work.

Operator CEO Robin Chan tells me the update will help the app push its $90 average purchase size and 10-15% conversion rate, which destroys the typical 1-3% conversion rate on ecommerce sites.
Not only could Operator’s experts give you the same personalized suggestions like you’d get from a lifelong record store clerk. If they promote the app and rally their own social graphs to score more commissions, they could give Operator a critical growth boost.
Operator emerged in April 2015 from Uber co-founder Garrett Camp’s startup studio Expa. Run by Chan, former head of Zynga’s Asia business and a successful angel investor, Operator raised a $10 million Series A from Greylock. But the iOS and Android beta apps have been slow to take off because they’re trying to teach people a totally new way to shop.

Instead of searching through a product database, Operator lets you type in a request for something over chat, like “brown mens shoes size 10 or 11 that are light but good for hiking”, “earbuds with the best bass under $100”, or “a super comfy leather couch that’s easy to move around.”
Tracking down products with those specific traits would be tough for an amateur. But Operator hosts shoe, headphone, and furniture experts who already know what’s best. “The products that work for us are considered purchases” says Chan. “If you’re going to spend a couple hundred or a thousand dollars on a thing, you want to talk to someone.”
This could be Amazon’s weak point. Competing with the commerce juggernaut on price or selection is a fool’s game. But plenty of digital shopping carts get abandoned because people are just too unsure to pull the trigger.

Operator pays commissions only, but hopes that can work out to at least $15 an hour. At first glance, that’s less than an Uber driver makes, but there’s no cost of gas, car, insurance, or the stress of being at the mercy of morons on the road. High performers could earn more through commissions.
The core of Operator’s challenge remains inserting itself at the moment of intent, and redirecting users from their go-to search engine or big box retailer. Chan promises he has some tricks up his sleeve for acquiring users and “getting them to understand this new model”. Whether Operator becomes a household app or ends up some tech giant’s acquihire will depend on it.
“We think of Operator as the third wave of commerce” Chan concludes. At first, everything had to be bought in person at a store. You got great help, but it was inconvenient. Next, websites let you conveniently buy from home, but you didn’t have assistance. Combining the ease of the internet with the help of a human could spur the next evolutionary leap in shopping.

724,Josh Constine,"Anonymity has proven a dangerous path for startups like Secret, so Yik Yak is pushing a soft pivot towards connection with people close by. You can still share anonymous quips on the sagging college app, but now it’s forcing you to add a handle and photo. Then it wants you to post status updates about what you’re doing that day, and browse and contact nearby Yakkers.
Changing course is critical for Yik Yak, which has declined in monthly users and on the iOS and Android app charts the past two years. It’s no longer red-hot with buzz. Reading anonymous jokes and gripes gets exhausting after awhile, leading to retention problems.
Meanwhile, since its users are mostly college kids sharing in esoteric campus bubbles, Yik Yak falls apart when they leave or summer or graduate. Local features could prove useful for them when they’re home or move to a new city.

Still, teaching an old app new tricks is a struggle. But Yik Yak has to find some way to make good on the $73 million it’s raised thanks to Sequoia. It’s stepping on the turf of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and Tinder with today’s update. That’s a pack of apps that’s tough to tangle with.
Yik Yak co-founder and CEO Tyler Droll explains that “The main difference here is the different graph. It’s all about the local graph” opposed to the immediate social graph and celebrities on these other apps. “What bar is everyone headed to across my entire campus? I can get the pulse in my community beyond my really close friend circle” Droll says.
The startup prepped for this shift over the past year with the launch of handles that create identity behind your posts but without your real name, profiles, photos, and finally, chat. Today it made handles and photos mandatory, which might rustle some jimmies.
With that groundwork laid, it’s not only burying some new features in extra tabs. It’s building them right into the main feed people already use, similar to Instagram Stories.
#Now lets Yakkers post 18-character, super-short status updates that disappear in 24 hours. It’s like Snapchat meets Down To Lunch. You could say you’re “studying bio”, “playing frisbee” or “Going to Old Pro” in hopes that other people will show up there too, or message you to meet up. People can see these on your profile or in the #Now tab atop the main feed.
Local Yakkers shows little profile thumbnails of up to 100 people close by atop your home tab and in the new Explore tab (renamed from Herds). This way you can dive into their profiles, see if you have similar interests, and chat them up. It’s sure to become a dating feature, though Yik Yak co-founder Brooks Buffington tells me that’s not the reason it was built.
“If I see someone else is listening to Jamie XX or something, that could resonate with me and I’d want to know more about them. Maybe Jamie XX is about to have a concert near campus and now I can find people to arrive with” says Buffington.
A week ago on dreary San Francisco afternoon, I sat by the gray waterfront with Brooks Buffington to discuss Yik Yak’s second act. The cloudy sky mirrored my feelings about Yik Yak. Though once it enjoyed its time in the sun, ominous signals had built up in the anonymous market. How would it emerge from this gloomy season of decline?
“Internally we’ve never been about anonymity” he tells me. In fact, it was just a consequence of a stripped-down sign-up flow. “We just wanted to get people in and experiencing the feed as soon as possible. Anonymity was kind of like a by product of that.”

When asked why he thought Secret failed, Buffington hesitated before noting  I don’t know, maybe they grew too fast?” By focusing on college geofences and launching one at a time, Yik Yak had strong reins on its expansion. Yet Buffington admits, “Even then, the way that we’ve grown is overwhelming at some point. There’s a lot of unforeseen things that you have to deal with when you’re gong 100 miles per hour.”
I repeatedly grilled Buffington about Yik Yak’s numbers, which external measurements peg as in decline. He dodged over and over, refusing to reveal any monthly or daily active user counts, and claiming the startup was pleased with its depth of engagement…even if he wouldn’t confirm the drop in number of people engaging.
“To us, DAU isn’t that big of a metric because it fluctuates so widely” Brooks bloviates. “A lot of games have enormous amounts of DAUs but they’re not recreating the same kind of deeper community engagement.”
Today’s update was announced as “Making your world feel small again”. That’s easy when you’re on a cushy US college campus surrounded by people like you. But what Buffington did admit was that “It’s a capped market that we’re in”.
To win big, he understands Yik Yak will need to impress new demographics like college grads and people around the world. It already barred teens by disabling it within high school geofences, so Yik Yak needs to become more serious, not more playful.
Right now, the app’s image is still firmly rooted in anonymous ephemera hurled out by randos in your proximity. This yak must evolve.",2016-08-16,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/yik-yak-screens2.png?w=738,,"Yik Yak yearns to be local, not just anonymous"
725,Josh Constine,"The big risk of Facebook launching the Messenger platform was that spammy bots could drown out your friends. Now Facebook is formalizing rules to prevent that because before, there were none.
Messenger API experiences may only respond to users who initiate conversations. They can only reply within 24 hours, and once more after that for reengagement. Subscription Messaging that requires an opt-in to spontaneously ping people may only be used for news, productivity, and personal health and finance tracker bots.
All developers must submit their Messenger integrations for an approval process which Facebook will complete within five days. Existing developers on the Messenger Platform have three months to comply, and existing subscription apps must be submitted for approval within six months.
You can find the nitty-gritty of the policy here. Previously, there were no restrictions on when bots could message people once the conversation started, and every developer could build a subscription bot. The only protection was that users would block bots that pissed them off.
The rules are reminiscent of sci-fi legend Isaac Asimov’s Three Rules Of Robotics.
These policies are critical for preventing the dehumanization of Messenger.
Facebook launched its bot platform at F8 in April, but it seemed a bit half-baked. Early examples were mediocre, and developers lacked the tools to optimize the experiences they built.
Bot spam threatened to train users to leave Facebook messages unopened, which in turn could make them less likely to reply to friends. If people suspect that Messenger is an overloaded channel like email, they may resort to SMS — a clunkier, outdated but low-spam medium.

What the Facebook Messenger desperately needs next is an analytics suite to allow developers to pinpoint exactly what they do that annoys users. This way they can tweak their bots to maximize utility and minimize interruption. Facebook Messenger’s VP of Product Stan Chudnovsky promised promised this analytics product was coming when he spoke with me at TechCrunch Disrupt NY in May, but there’s still no sign of it.
With Facebook having trounced the rest of the chat app pack except for WhatsApp which it bought, and WeChat beyond its domain, SMS is Messenger’s true competitor. While the future of messaging may involve AI bots at our beck and call, Facebook jeopardizes its basic use case if spam spirals out of control.

726,Josh Constine,"Can Google spring back from its social failures with a bare-bones video-calling app that unites iOS and Android users? Today it’s launching Duo, which lets you video call people one-on-one via their phone number.
The problem is they’ll have to download the app but won’t get any bells and whistles or the ability to connect with Google Chat, Hangouts, Spaces, the upcoming Allo messaging product, or Google’s Android SMS app. Google’s adding one more silo to its mess of communication apps.
Duo was announced at Google I/O in May and rolls out globally today on Android and iOS 9 in 78 languages. It will be a hard sell considering how late to market Duo is compared to strong, sensibly intertwined products like Facebook Messenger and Apple’s iMessage/FaceTime.
You can watch our video demo of Duo here:
	
		
		
	
Duo is best understood as a no-frills FaceTime competitor that works with Android devices instead of just Apple products. Nabbing those users who want to video call their Android friends is one avenue for success.
Duo looks a bit bland, though, since it can’t do group calling, video effects or text chat. If you want to video call someone without Duo, you’ll have to invite them over SMS with an app download link. Starting from zero users with that level of uncertainty might push people to go with a competitor their contacts are likely to already have. That’s a big disadvantage versus the ubiquitous Facebook Messenger and Skype’s video call features.
“The logic is that [apps] will succeed if they’re solving a use case really well,” Google’s VP of product management for consumer communication Nick Fox tells me, though this ignores the fact that a product needs to solve something others haven’t already.
Fox explains that Google focused on three things with Duo. First, “if there’s anything that was our North Star, it was to be super, super simple.” Second, Fox says, is speed and reliability, thanks to Duo being built on Google’s WebRTC video framework to handle HD or 2G. And third, “The human element. You don’t hear Google talk about this all that often, but we wanted to enable the human on the other end of the call to really be the experience.” 

At least Duo succeeds at that. You open it, with no need for a Google account, and see the camera facing you. At the bottom is a list of recent calls and frequent contacts, with another tab that contains a full list of contacts who either have or don’t have Duo. Start a call and it goes full-screen. If someone misses a call, they’ll get a notification. That’s basically it. Don’t expect any Hangouts mustaches or costumes, but the video quality is solid.
The one innovative feature Duo sports is called Knock-Knock, which lets the recipient of a call see the caller before they accept and turn on their own camera.
Fox says that otherwise, entering a call can be “pretty abrupt” since you don’t know if they’re lazing at home, in business mode at the office, or on the go. With Knock-Knock, “as a recipient of the call you see them beforehand so you know their state of mind. I make silly faces to my kids…so when they see the preview, they start with a laugh.”

This late in the game, Google will be fighting a steep uphill battle to get Duo traction. Video calling isn’t a non-stop use case like text chat, and is often an extension of those conversations. Marooning Duo in its own app and not allowing it to connect to any other Google communications apps or websites is a bizarre choice. People might forget to use it even if they do download it.
Duo’s best bet will be the developing world thanks to its optimization for poor network connections like 2G. It can degrade video quality or switch to audio calling if there’s weak connectivity, and it can seamlessly hand off between cell and Wi-Fi connections in mid-call without dropping.
The developing world has only recently gotten the phones and network connections necessary for video calling. The top chat app there, Facebook’s WhatsApp, still doesn’t have video calling, although it’s in the works. Perhaps a dedicated app for video calling over data could find some of the success WhatsApp did replacing SMS.

With Duo and Allo (and Google Chat, Android SMS, and Spaces) for consumers, RCS messaging services for carriers, and Hangouts for the enterprise, Google is still a bit chaotic when it comes to communication. It seems to be reeling from failing to secure the acquisition of WhatsApp, which turned Facebook into the dominant global player.
The whole Duo situation is embarrassing for Google considering how the technology involved in Hangouts seemed light years ahead of its time — almost five years. Google only now getting serious about mobile video chat is cringeworthy.
Duo is either Google blowing up its consumer communications stack by surrendering the rest of the chat space and keeping Duo separate so the underused apps don’t weigh it down, or it’s another misstep by adding more disconnected islands to the archipelago. Despite all its engineering prowess when it comes to organizing information, Google is still awkward when it comes to creating inter-human community.",2016-08-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/google-duo1.png?w=738,google-duo,"Google launches Duo video-calling app, a dull cross-OS FaceTime rival"
727,Lucia Maffei,"Google announced today that Hangouts On Air will move from Google+ to YouTube Live on September 12; users will be asked to migrate to YouTube Live.
In an email to TechCrunch, Google confirmed that Hangouts on Air isn’t shutting down, but will move to YouTube Live. “We’re focusing our live streaming efforts on YouTube Live and consolidating our services there,” a Google spokesperson wrote. “Hangouts on Air has been available through YouTube since it was launched and YouTube Live is a natural home for the service.”
As first reported by Emil Protalinski on VentureBeat, Google debuted the live-streaming feature for its Hangouts group video chat on Google+ in September 2011, then completed the roll out in June 2012. YouTube Live debuted less than one year later, in May 2013.
After the deadline of September 12, events cannot be scheduled on Google+, and existing events scheduled after September 12 must be moved to YouTube Live.
Users will continue to have access to their recorded event on YouTube. Google+ will have your event content available in read-only format in the Activity Log.

728,Josh Constine,"Snapchat could help you organize a night out with friends or get a digest of the day’s news thanks to its acquisition of mobile search startup Vurb. TechCrunch caught wind of the impending deal over the weekend and now The Information reports Snapchat is in the closing stages of talks to pay $110 million for Vurb (75 percent stock, 25 percent cash). Snapchat is also said to offer $75 million in retention bonuses to keep Vurb founder and CEO Bobby Lo around.
Unfortunately, rewiring people’s behavior patterns around search proved too difficult, even if Google wasn’t built for mobile. Vurb struggled for mass traction, and now it’s selling. Snapchat tells me it’s not commenting on the news. Lo said he was bound by legal restrictions, so he couldn’t talk about it — which points to a deal.

Vurb won TechCrunch’s Disrupt NY 2014 Startup Battlefield competition with its take on mobile search focused around browsing rather than endless results pages. Vurb could help you check out movies, find a theater to watch one and restaurants nearby where you might want to eat. Then you could bundle these options and share them with friends. Vurb made mobile decision-making collaborative. Traditional search engines didn’t understand how those things would connect.
Vurb’s card-based interface pulls in information from partners like Yelp and Rotten Tomatoes, and can deep-link you out to Uber and Google Maps. It later aimed to become a monolithic WeChat-style app that built utilities from third-parties onto its new instant messaging feature to help you arrange plans. And just last week it added more personalized recommendations.

You can see how Vurb works in this demo video we made:
It’s unclear exactly what Vurb will do at Snapchat, but helping users make plans with friends is one possibility. Vurb could build upon Snapchat’s existing feature that automatically turns addresses into map links. When users chat about a movie, restaurant or place, Snapchat could help them learn more and arrange to meet up there.
Alternatively, Vurb’s more recent direction of trying to be a daily information digest for mobile users could fit somehow into Snapchat. Imagine if alongside the professional content Discover channels there was a personalized view of what’s going on in the world distilled for the modern (i.e. short) attention span.
Vurb is another startup coming to an end as part of The Conclusion, a trend we wrote about yesterday where startups are running out of money as fundraising gets tougher following the recent market correction. Rather than simply vaporize or testing ideas in a ghost town, selling to Snapchat could allow Vurb to fertilize the mobile future as part of an app people actually use.",2016-08-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/vurb-battlefield-winner.jpg?w=738,"battlefield,mergers-and-acquisitions,vurb",Snapchat is acquiring mobile search app Vurb for $110M+
729,Fitz Tepper,"Bumble’s been hinting for a while that they are getting ready to turn on monetization features in their girl-dominated dating app, and now they’ve finally done it.
Starting today users will be able to pay for a package subscription model that will get them three new features for $9.99 per month, with discounts available if you prepay for 3 or 6 months.
The three features are called Beeline, Rematch and Busybee, and are designed to supercharge the mobile dating experience.
The first feature, Beeline, will pre-populate a queue of users who have already “liked” you, so you can skip the swiping and match with them by just tapping yes. While this takes away the mystery of traditional swipe-based dating (will my suitor also swipe yes?), it makes the process much more efficient.
Rematch is exactly what it sounds like – it keeps expired matches in your queue (Bumble matches expire in 24 hours if no conversation is started), so you can try again to get their attention.
The last one, Busy Bee, lets you extend the 24-hour window so you can have another day to try to match with someone. This was previously available for men in the form of “extend”, a feature that was only available on a day. Now paying male users will get unlimited extends, and the feature and will now be available to (paying) female users for the first time.
For comparison, Tinder’s paid version is also $9.99 per month for most users, and offers additional features instead of a paywall. However the features themselves are different, with Tinder instead opting to let you “undo” a swipe and change your location to match with users in other cities.

Bumble’s new paid features sort of overlap – rematching with an expired match essentially gets you the same benefit of just extending the match for 24 hours. But regardless of overlap the features should still be useful enough for hard core Bumble users to shell out $9.99 per month.
The company is stressing that all of these features are optional editions, and no users will lose any features that are currently free. This makes sense, as new paywalls can often disappoint and turn off users – something Bumble definitely doesn’t want to risk doing, especially because of the very strong engagement the platform is currently seeing.
Another example of the startup closely curating the user experience is the fact that Bumble has still refused to add any advertising to the platform. To date they really have only worked with brands on specific features (like Spotify) but did say they are looking to finally let brands advertise on the platform in some form or another by early 2017.",2016-08-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gettyimages-488530020.jpg?w=738,"dating-apps,dating,monetization",Bumble is finally monetizing with paid features to better help you find a match
730,Anthony Ha,"Mobile app Triller isn’t just a simple way to make music videos anymore — it recently added social features that allow users to follow other users and explore their videos.
I should probably back up a second and explain what Triller is. It’s an iPhone and Android app that allows you to create a video by taking a snippet of your favorite song, adding a video filter and singing along. Co-founder and CEO David Leiberman said the app is easy to use, but at the same time, “we still preserve the illusion of glamour that’s often destroyed in video.”
“We’re giving people the opportunity to make a video that doesn’t look like a bad bar mitzvah video,” he added.
Initially, Triller was just focused on allowing users to create the videos — you’d make them in the app, then share and watch them elsewhere.
But that started to change with the launch of Triller Famous, a section that highlights a curated selection of user-submitted videos. Leiberman said the response was pretty encouraging, with nearly a million users signing up to submit (he said the app has seen 10 million downloads overall).

731,Lucia Maffei,"The Google Play Store will not require you to have a Google+ account to write reviews anymore.
In an email to TechCrunch, Google confirmed the news that “a G+ profile is no longer needed to post a review.” Rumors that the change was happening were first reported by Android Police, which quoted several tips from its readers.
As of today, the roll out appears to be continuing. We’ve tried to leave a book review by visiting Play Store via laptop and the system required us to create a Google+ profile. However, other people successfully posted app reviews by using an Android phone without having a Google+ account.
The removal of the Google+ profile requirement is part of ongoing changes with Google+ across many Google products, which started last year. The first major move was disconnecting Google+ from YouTube’s comments.
“People have told us that accessing all of their Google stuff with one account makes life a whole lot easier,” Google VP of Streams, Photos and Sharing Bradley Horowitz wrote in a blog post. “But we’ve also heard that it doesn’t make sense for your Google+ profile to be your identity in all the other Google products you use.”

732,Natasha Lomas,"Well that was fast. Just one day after WhatsApp revealed a sea-change in its attitude to user data, by detailing plans to share the mobile numbers and last seen status of its users with parent company Facebook for ad-targeting and marketing purposes, the UK’s data protection watchdog has fired a warning shot across Zuckerberg’s bows by announcing it intends to investigate the arrangement.
In a statement today, fresh-in-post UK information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who only took up the role last month, said: “We’ve been informed of the changes. Organisations do not need to get prior approval from the ICO to change their approaches, but they do need to stay within data protection laws. We are looking into this.”
Denham said the regulator will be considering whether the two companies are being transparent with users about how their data is being shared and used.
“The changes WhatsApp and Facebook are making will affect a lot of people. Some might consider it’ll give them a better service, others may be concerned by the lack of control. Our role is to pull back the curtain on things like this, ensuring that companies are being transparent with the public about how their personal data is being shared, and protecting consumers by making sure the law is being followed,” she added.
A WhatsApp spokesperson had this to say when asked for comment on the ICO’s interest in its new privacy policy: “We look forward to answering any questions regulators or other stakeholders have about this update.”
Discussing the legal implications of the new data-sharing arrangement between WhatsApp and Facebook with TechCrunch earlier today, Scott Vernick, partner and head of the data security and privacy practice at U.S. law firm Fox Rothschild LLP, suggested regulators will be keen to ensure the language used in the updated T&Cs clearly and accurately conveys the changes being made.
“The question that any regulator will be asking is whether or not the new policies and the way in which you opt into them — or opt out of them — is expressed in clear to the average user,” he said. “There’s no doubt that a disclosure is being made, but it’s a question of whether it’s transparent enough to the average user so you know exactly what it is you’re giving up.”
When WhatsApp users are prompted to agree to the new T&Cs in the app, the wording that describes the purpose of the setting where they can opt out of sharing data with Facebook is as follows: “Share my WhatsApp account information with Facebook to improve my Facebook ads and products experiences. Your chats and phone number will not be shared onto Facebook regardless of this setting.” — Emphasis theirs.
It’s possible that someone reading that wording quickly might think their phone number will not be shared with Facebook. When in fact it will be shared with Facebook the company. (But will just not be publicly posted onto their own Facebook page.) So there certainly looks to be some room for confusion, although it remains to be seen whether the ICO will view the phrasing as troublingly opaque or not.
Vernick also suggested another area that might be problematic for the WhatsApp/Facebook data-sharing arrangement is if the two companies gave certain guarantees to regulators about how they would handle user data at the time of the WhatsApp acquisition — and can now be shown to be reneging on any earlier commitments.
“The regulators have been much more active in looking at the M&A space, and looking at the privacy consequences for M&A activity,” he noted. “And so I could see a scenario in which if either Facebook or WhatsApp or the both of them made certain representations to the regulators, either in the States or in Europe, about what was going to happen with individual user information once the two companies hooked up and now they’re going back on that, then that could be a real issue.”
Potential legal implications aside, Vernick argued there is an unavoidable “visceral” reaction to such a big change by WhatsApp on sharing user data, given how the company has previously positioned itself as a privacy champion — which in itself could have serious trust/reputational consequences if users feel betrayed.
“I think there’s a real visceral issue here which in some ways is more important than the legal issue — not that the legal issues aren’t important, but it’s just this idea that as consumers, or as users, we continue — assuming there’s anything left to lose — we just continue to lose more,” he said.
“It feels like a bit of a bait and switch. Or it feels like I’m losing more control even though my choices are ‘well if you don’t like it, just don’t use it’,” he added.
In terms of ‘choice’, other encrypted messaging apps are of course available. One example, Telegram, offers end-to-end encryption via a secret chats features. Another, Signal, is made by the same company that makes the open source secure-messaging protocol that WhatsApp has rolled out to its own app — completing that rollout earlier this year.
Telegram founder Pavel Durov confirmed to TechCrunch the app has seen a small bump in downloads since the WhatsApp privacy policy change was announced, with an increase of new users in the region of 30 to 40 per cent over the past 24 hours. Although he added that it has not seen “millions” of downloads — as it did when the Facebook-WhatsApp acquisition was announced, back in February 2014.",2016-08-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/facebook-whatsapp-screen.jpg?w=738,privacy,WhatsApp-Facebook data-sharing deal probed by UK privacy watchdog
733,Steve O'Hear,"When I wrote “it’s game on” after Mondo became the last of the four British challenger banks to secure a banking license earlier this month, I didn’t think competitor Starling Bank would take my words quite so literally. But that’s just happened in the form of a domain name prank following Mondo’s announcement that it has changed its name to Monzo after a trademark dispute forced the young company to rebrand.
As Monzo co-founder and co-CEO Tom Blomfield (who previously founded GoCardless) was unveiling the new name yesterday evening at an event held at the startup’s London office and live streamed on YouTube, little would he have known that somebody at rival Starling Bank had registered the domain name “getmonzo.co.uk” — a domain unfortunately similar to the startup’s existing “getmondo.co.uk”.
A visit to the “getmonzo.co.uk” address reveals a message from Starling Bank founder and CEO Anne Boden congratulating Monzo on its rebrand and promoting the startup’s own wares, including the slogan: “Anything is possible”.

What most visitors won’t be aware of is that the latter is a bit of an in-joke between Monzo’s Blomfield and Starling’s Boden, since Starling Bank itself changed its name from BankPossible and the two challenger bank founders have history.
Blomfield previously teamed up with Boden to help start Starling before “tensions” led him to venture out on his own, taking three of Starling’s team with him, according to a report in the FT. One of those is also Monzo co-founder and CCO/Head of Product Jason Bates.
“When we heard the rumour [of the new name], we checked whether the trade mark was registered and found that it was at preregistration,” explains Boden. “We then checked the domain and found that a few Monzo Bank domains had not been registered. We were quite surprised. It was too good to be true and we couldn’t resist having some fun”.
And fun the Starling team had, with lots of self-congratulatory re-tweets appearing as fintech industry watchers and Monzo users, who were actually asked to crowdsource the new name, began to notice the prank. “Fans of Monzo and Starling joined in. It’s a great community doing something exciting,” adds Boden.
As for what will happen to the getmonzo.co.uk domain next, I’m told Starling Bank plans to auction it off for charity and match the resulting donation. Stay classy.",2016-08-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/monzo.png?w=738,mondo,How rival challenger bank Starling pranked Mondo on day new name Monzo was unveiled
734,Natasha Lomas,"London-based ticketing startup Dice, which sells mobile tickets without booking fees and with a current focus on millennials wanting to discover new bands to see live, has closed a $6 million Series A funding round.
The round was led by Evolution Equity Partners with participation from existing investors White Star Capital, Designer Fund and Kima Ventures, along with several music industry angel investors. It also added new investor Lumia Capital for the round.
With the Series A, which closed in June but is being announced now, Dice has raised $10 million to date — topping up to its initial $1.6M in seed funding in the interim. It’s grown to 42 employees over that time, including a music and data science team focused on building machine learning algorithms to help users figure out what their next big night out should be via a shortlist of recommended gigs shown below each listed event.
Handily its investor roster includes DeepMind co-founders Mustafa Suleyman and Demis Hassabis — a connect that Dice CEO and co-founder Phil Hutcheon tells TechCrunch has been very helpful as it develops its recommendation algorithms. It’s also aiming to make its data work for promoters to help them figure out when and where to put on a gig, and even what to charge. So it’s aiming to serve both sides of the music industry: fans and artists.
The app includes a waitlist feature where fans who miss out on buying a ticket in the primary sale can add their name to be notified if another Dice user subsequently wants to return tickets to resell via the app (at the same price). This then generates demand data that Dice can use to help promoters and artists run more successful events in future.
“Machine learning’s a big part of our future as we expand and go into new territories — to help understand new things,” says Hutcheon. “Because it’s easy to know your own city but when you go into new cities and especially as you expand and scale what are the right venues for this type of artist to play at? Does their audience go to this venue or that venue? What’s the best price to get someone to attend the concert? What was the waiting list like for that artists?
“The weather? The time of the year? What else is on that night? All these things factor in to the success of an event. And one of the things that we’ve been trying to teach promoters is that it’s probably not a good business model to have every concert available go on sale at nine o’clock on a Friday. Maybe stagger it through the week. It’s okay for it not to sell out in five minutes — it will sell out, but it might just take a little bit longer… As long as each venue is full on the night, that’s fine. That’s our objective.”
We last covered Dice almost two years ago when it launched its iOS and Android apps in its first city, London. Since May this year it’s been live nationwide in the U.K., and Hutcheon says it’s now selling 35 per cent of its tickets outside London.
“We joke around that Netflix is our competitor because they’re trying to keep people in — and we’re trying to get people out,” he says, while conceding that a more traditional rival would be a ticketing giant like Ticketmaster. Although Dice is intentionally far more selective in what it sells.
Dice claims its app is on the phones of close to half (40 per cent) of the millennials in London at this point, although Hutcheon won’t break out active users yet.
He will say that over 700 artists have sold tickets on Dice thus far (it never sources tickets via secondary routes — and is vocally anti-tout, including building its own tech aimed at spotting and preventing touts from buying up tickets; a mission helped by Dice tickets being tied to the mobile device they are bought on).
He also says they have signed up all the venues they want to work with thus far — emphasizing that Dice remains an intentionally curated gigs experience, so they only put events on the app which they personally rate and think their primary audience of up to 33-year-olds will also enjoy.
The team is particularly pleased about snagging a partnership with Apple that will see Dice offering tickets for acts performing at the Apple Music Festival in London this year — through a series of in-app competitions. Another bit of news it’s announcing today.
The Dice pitch from the get-go has been about building a fan-focused, trusted events brand — using seasoned gig goers to power expert curation to give its users the confidence to spend money to go out. It has evolved from an initial human-only in-app gig curation to a blend of human and algorithmic recommendation to try to crack the new (live) music discovery problem at scale.
Nor do they just have new/up-and-coming artists on Dice. Some very big and mainstream artists, playing in massive stadium venues, have also allocated tickets for sale on Dice — including Justin Bieber, Adele and Taylor Swift. But then not all millennials are going to want to go and see a lesser known grime artist play in a basement in Hackney Wick. Some of these kids even want to go see Mumford & Sons — another mainstream artist Dice has sold tickets for via the app… So there’s an inevitable element of variety needed to cater to users’ music tastes.
At the last count, Hutcheon says the app had around 1,400 UK gigs on it. “All really, really good”, he asserts. “Everything on Dice is good. We’re creating this universe where we have quality on there.” While at the same time trying, with the recommendation features, to account for variety of taste — and how taste can fluctuate within the same person. So, in other words, just because you went to see that one grime artist that one time doesn’t mean you only want to see grime artists all the time…
“We’ve taken our time to do discovery because we want to see what works,” he tells TechCrunch. “And it’s pretty amazing how accurate it is. The next release of discovery on Dice… will have [a user’s] top ten artists to check out over the next month, based on your behavior within Dice.”
Why the focus on millennials? Because they’re going out more, of course. And the occasional high profile Taylor Swift gig aside, Hutcheon says Dice’s “sweet spot is identifying new artists, building those new artists up and getting them to larger venues” — which typically means selling cheaper tickers. (Which in turn means its youthful users can afford to go out more often and therefore use the app more. So, in short, Dice gets to roll more.)
“You want people who use Dice multiple times a month — not just goes to one Bruce Springsteen concert a year and that’s it,” he adds. “That’s what we really focus on. How do fans discover the new artists and get to the concert, know about them, and then discover the next one?”
Dice is grossing “eight figures” in ticket sale transactions at this point, according to Hutcheon — which he describes as “pretty good” going for just two years in. Although it’s not actively monetizing yet — beyond a few sponsored gigs with brands like Red Bull.
“We know how we want to monetize but we’re still building the product and still growing,” he says, adding: “We just need to get a bit bigger.”
The new funding will be going towards more product dev work — with a fully fledged launch of its discovery recommendation feature due soon (a rough-cut MVP version is live now), likely next month; and work ongoing for a feature that will allow users to transfer a ticket to a friend through the app (while preserving Dice’s anti-tout features).
It’s also eyeing international expansion — with Dublin set to be its first city launch outside the UK. A U.S. launch is on the cards too, slated for the end of this year or early next, though Hutcheon talks excitedly about Dice’s potential in various European cities too. A big part of his job is making the decisions about where to focus, he says, adding: “There’s still a bunch of things we need to build — which will hopefully be finished by the end of October. And that’s when our focus is outside of the UK.”
With the core tech of the ticketing platform built, Hutcheon reckons launching into new locations can happen quickly — a case of getting people on the ground to scope out the music scene and determine the right sorts of venues/gigs for the audience. Dice employs a team of A&R scouts to go to gigs and find new bands that put on a good live show. (That’s actual humans going to gigs to find the next cool live band; robot scouts most definitely aren’t on the roadmap, he laughs.)
“It may not need to be a choice between the US and Europe; we may be able to do everything at once,” he adds. “What we’ve seen when we’ve launched outside of London is it’s not too much work on the ground… Because we’ve built an end-to-end solution from buying the tickets, automatically paying promotors, having discovery promote the events themselves.
“For outside of London we have two people looking after the whole of the UK and that’s it… So for me it’s just making sure that when we do go into a territory that we have a long term plan. That we don’t just turn up and then six months later retreat.”
Ultimately, for all its music passion and pedigree, the team is also looking beyond gigs — with the core ticketing platform clearly applicable to other verticals. And, along with international expansion, launching into additional verticals is one way to grow usage without having to compromise a ‘curated for quality’ mission.
Getting big enough to see a path to monetizing without losing the inherent selectiveness of its brand promise looks like it’s lining up to be Dice’s post-Series A challenge.
Hutcheon cites theatre and sports as two other verticals on its radar for 2017, although whether any apps it launches for those segments would also be Dice-branded or called something entirely different is yet to be determined.
“We are concentrating on music right now but I think this time next year we would be in different verticals like sports and theatre,” he says. “Music is something that we’re super passionate about, and will always be in our hearts, but the technology side it is a lot of people spending a lot of time solving complex things — and it can address issues in different arenas.”
“Maybe you could pre-order your Tesla on Dice,” he adds. “If you think about it, there’s so many people trying to buy something at the same time — and being able to handle that traffic, and let people know if they haven’t got the ticket immediately that they’re on the waiting list.
“The worst thing is to go on sale at nine o’clock and then be stuck in a queue for 35 minutes or hours… And then at the end of it being told ‘oh sorry, we couldn’t get you a ticket’. So we’ve built it in a way that within a few minutes you’ll know if you haven’t got a ticket. And we’ll put you onto a waiting list, and when someone can’t make it it’s your best chance to get a ticket.”
So from tickets — to potential Tesla buyers… But if you’ve solved the problem of serving surge demand with a frustration-free mobile sales experience then your tech has the potential to scale beyond selling £5 tickets for Toyboy & Robin at The Nest. Or even £55 for Taylor Swift in Hyde Park.
Or at least, that’s what Dice is gambling on.",2016-08-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/p1040686.jpg?w=738,"ticketing,kima-ventures,white-star-capital,london",Dice snags $6M to win more fans for its frustration-free ticketing platform
735,Mike Butcher,"Songkick, which allows you to track the gigs of your favorite music artists and buy tickets to concerts, has raised a further $15 million in funding from Access Industries.
Songkick says it now plans to use the money to “enhance the connection between artists and fans,” increase ticket sales and prevent scalping.
Songkick’s app and web platform scans a user’s music collection from their music or via a streaming service like Spotify and finds the upcoming gigs from those acts local to the user.
The U.K. startup, which now has a sizeable presence in the U.S., previously secured $10 million, also from Access Industries. The company has now raised more than $60 million in total.
In June 2016, Songkick merged with artist-ticketing service Crowdsurge in an attempt to break Ticketmaster’s hold on the market. Songkick has now won over acts including Paul McCartney, Adele, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Metallica, who prefer the control the platform gives them and its ability to detect when tickets are mostly likely being bought by scalpers.
Matt Jones, chief executive of Songkick, and formerly CEO at Crowdsurge before joining co-founder Ian Hogarth as co-CEO says: “The biggest myth in live music is that ticket scalping is somehow impossible to prevent, but with the right focus and the right tools, these issues can be solved, and Songkick is at the leading edge of solving them.”
Songkick has also been trying to muzzle into the ticketing game. Back in May it suffered a setback in its legal battle with rival ticketing giant Ticketmaster over presales to artist fan clubs after a judge handed a victory to Ticketmaster and Live Nation, the largest concert promoter.
Hogarth, the last original co-founder, has, some months ago, now stepped down from the co-CEO position to become chairman, leaving Jones as CEO.

736,Natasha Lomas,"Productivity focused third party iOS keyboard app ThingThing is hoping to woo fans of the Sunrise calendar by adding a meeting invite feature — following the latter’s kiss-of-death acquisition by Microsoft last year.
Redmond has chosen integrating Sunrise features into its flagship email app Outlook over maintaining two apps, meaning the Sunrise app itself will sunset at the end of this month. The latter’s own keyboard scheduling app Meet has also been closed. Leaving some unhappy Sunrise fans looking for their next calendar app. And ThingThing pulling out the stops to be able to offer them a fully featured alternative. Which it now reckons it can.
ThingThing, a Barcelona-based startup, launched its third party iOS keyboard app over a year ago, with an initial focus on smoothing the pain of app switching by letting users do more within the keyboard itself by integrating with a variety of third party services. The team has since closed a $400,000 seed round.
So with ThingThing you can, for instance, pull in photos from your camera roll, view appointments in your calendar, grab files from Dropbox, Box or Google Drive, see your contacts, view your Todoist tasks, see what’s in your Pocket, and eyeball stuff on your Instagram or Facebook. All without leaving whatever other app you’re using because ThingThing lives within the keyboard panel (it also has its own predictive keyboard).
Now, with its latest app update, ThingThing is touting the launch of ‘Calendar 2.0’, whereby the flagship new feature is the ability to send meeting invites right within the keyboard — including for one-to-one and for group meetings… So basically the Sunrise Meet killer app.
ThingThing CEO and co-founder Olivier Plante has even been taking to Twitter to encourage Sunrise fans to download ThingThing… Which is certainly a quicker route to recovering in-keyboard meeting scheduling vs hoping/waiting for Microsoft to add it to Outlook…
“A lot of users have asked us to create invites directly from the keyboard just like Sunrise Meet, and we did,” says Plante. “The whole back end of creating meetings, making sure it’s easy for users… we did it all, and more neat additions are coming up!”
If you’re using the feature to invite a non-ThingThing user to a meeting they won’t need to download the app to accept — rather it will email them a link to a meeting invite where they can respond. And, if they accept, they’ll get a calendar invite emailed back to them.
While the calendar is the big focus for this update, another new addition lets ThingThing users manage their Todoist to-do list inside the keyboard — so they can now create tasks within the keyboard and save a task from a message by holding and copying any text while the app is active, which will trigger an option to ‘Save inside’. Todoist tasks can also be marked as complete and shared via the app.
“For now, we support Todoist but we’ll shortly rollout other integrations such as Wunderlist, Evernote, OneNote, Trello, Asana, etc,” adds Plante. “Toward a keyboard as a platform!”",2016-08-25,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/p1040692.jpg?w=738,"calendar,ios,thingthing",ThingThing iOS keyboard app adds meeting invites to woo Sunrise users
737,Natasha Lomas,"A fresh chapter of the crypto wars looks to be opening up in Europe, after the French and German interior ministers took to a podium yesterday to lobby for a law change that would enable courts to demand that Internet companies decrypt data to help further criminal investigations.
So, in other words, to effectively push for end-to-end encryption to be outlawed. Yes we’ve been here before — many times.
Giving a joint press conference in Paris yesterday with German’s Thomas de Maizière, France’s interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve called for the European Commission to change the law to afford security agencies the ability to access encrypted data.
They want their proposals discussed by the European Commission at a meeting next month.
The context here is that France and Germany have suffered a spate of terrorist attacks over the past year, including a co-ordinated attack in Paris in November 2015 that killed 130; a July 2016 attack in Nice where a truck driver ploughed into crowds celebrating Bastille Day; and a stabbing in a church in Northern France that killed an elderly priest.
A series of knife attacks and a suicide bombing have also taken place in Germany over the same timeframe — purportedly carried out by Islamist terrorists. Although the significance of encrypted comms to carrying out any of these terror plots remains unclear.
The FT quotes Patrick Calvar, French homeland security chief, saying “gigabytes” of data was collected after November’s mass shooting in Paris — and that it is “often encrypted, and impossible to decipher”. The paper also notes that the Isis cell responsible for the Paris attack used WhatsApp and Telegram — two comms apps that offer end-to-end encryption. However the same Isis cell was also reported to have used unencrypted SMS in their comms.
Cazeneuve’s speech yesterday touched on various aspects of internal security, including calling for better border controls in Europe and improved information sharing between EU member states. But on encryption he framed the challenge for Europe’s democracies as a need to “armer” themselves against terrorist’s use of encryption with a legislative power to afford security agencies access to the encrypted comms apps he said terrorists are using to communicate.
While referencing the importance of encryption for lawful activity such as protecting financial transactions, Cazeneuve singled out certain comms apps that make use of end-to-end encryption as problematic for security services — name-checking the Telegram app specifically. (Although it’s worth noting that Telegram only uses e2e encryption for a ‘secret chats’ feature; other messaging apps, such as WhatsApp, have rolled out e2e encryption as the default for all comms.)
“What we are saying, however, is that exchanges more systematic operated via some applications, such as Telegram, must be able, as part of court proceedings — and I stress this — to be identified and used as evidence by the investigation and magistrates services,” said Cazeneuve [via Google Translate].
He noted that some Internet companies are co-operating with European security services that request access to their user data but flagged Telegram as a company where state security agencies have “no contact”.
The two minister are calling for the EC to legislate to enforce the same rights and obligations on operators of any telecom or Internet service offered to users in Europe, regardless of whether they are headquartered in Europe.
And for a new obligation on operators deemed uncooperative — i.e. when it comes to removing illegal content or decrypting messages for the security services on demand.
“If such legislation were passed, it would allow us, at European level, to impose obligations on operators that uncooperative disclose such to remove illegal content or decrypt messages, exclusively in the context of criminal investigations,” added Cazeneuve.
The tug of war over end-to-end encryption
The call for decryption on demand echoes the political trajectory in the UK over the past few years, where the Conservative government has pushed to expand surveillance legislation and cement legal powers to demand decryption via legal warrant.
The UK’s Investigatory Powers bill, now progressing through the parliament’s upper chamber, includes limits on the use of end-to-end encryption that could be used to require a company to remove encryption. Or even force a comms service provider not to use end-to-end encryption to secure a future service they are developing.
Of course the basic point about end-to-end encryption is that the operator does not hold the encryption keys, so cannot decrypt data itself. But with politicians legislating for decryption on demand the legality of e2e encryption becomes undermined — and its usage imperiled.
And as myriad security experts, tech industry bodies and data protection advocates continue to point out, backdoored encryption inevitably entails security risks for all users — not just for the suspects security agencies want to target. There is no ‘golden key’ just for the security agencies.
Expressing concern at the latest Franco-German proposals, for example, the Europe director of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, Christian Borggreen, had this to say a statement: “We are worried that EU proposals can allow governments to challenge end-to-end encryption and thus threaten the security and confidentiality of Europeans’ communications.
“It is certainly understandable that some would respond to recent tragedies with backdoors and more government access.  But weakened security ultimately leaves online systems more vulnerable to all types of attacks from terrorists to hackers.  This should be a time to increase security — not weaken it.”
Meanwhile, only last month the EU’s data protection supervisor, Giovanni Buttarelli, put out an official opinion on a review of the region’s ePrivacy directive — next in line for updating, after the European parliament adopted the GDPR earlier this year — in which he specifically calls for end-to-end encryption to be safeguarded.
“The new rules should… clearly allow users to use end-to-end encryption (without ‘backdoors’) to protect their electronic communications,” Buttarelli writes in his ePrivacy opinion. “Decryption, reverse engineering or monitoring of communications protected by encryption should be prohibited.”
The ePrivacy directive governs how companies handle customer data but currently only applies to telcos, not Internet companies such as WhatsApp — aka the providers of over-the-top comms apps that offer alternatives to SMS.
Telcos are lobbying for the law to be expanded to encompass Internet companies. Even as security agencies are pushing for backdoors into encryption. Leaving data protection advocates to point out the folly of risking the security of all users… So tl;dr: get ready for yet another chapter of the crypto wars.",2016-08-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/screen-shot-2016-08-24-at-1-29-39-pm.png?w=738,"end-to-end-encryption,telegram,cryptography",Encryption under fire in Europe as France and Germany call for decrypt law

When TechCrunch covered Prisma’s launch in June CEO and co-founder Alexey Moiseenkov explained it was using neural networks to transform smartphone photos into art filtered imagery — with these neural nets running on its servers.
It’s now evidently been able to offline some of that grunt work to a user’s own device hardware — with a selection of filters available to process images locally. Which is certainly one way to scale usage for multiple millions of users.
“Now 16 filters are on device,” Moiseenkov tells TechCrunch, adding: “Yes neural networks [are] running locally on your iPhone.”
The time taken to process images in offline mode can be quicker than the cloud processing route, as you’d expect. Although it also depends on the hardware of your phone (I’m using an iPhone 6s).
“From iPhone 5s it works ok but lower [hardware] seems that server side will be always better,” Moiseenkov adds, discussing the limitations of local processing.
The original idea for Prisma was to mobilize similar artwork processing algorithms that Moiseenkov had seen online but only working very slowly — optimizing the processing so it could work on an Internet-connected smartphone for the instant gratification ‘Instagram generation’.
Optimizing the processing for smartphone hardware itself takes things even further. “For devices higher than iPhone 5s I think all [processing will] be on device soon,” adds Moiseenkov.
He says the offline feature will be coming to Prisma’s Android app soon — “maybe” in the next two weeks.
Another slated feature the team is developing — the ability to apply art filters to video — is still in the works. He says it’s possible that will launch this month.
With the current update Prisma has also added the ability for users to make charity donations to help children with serious illnesses.

739,Natasha Lomas,"A controversial data-sharing agreement between Google-owned AI company DeepMind and the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) has caught the eye of the National Data Guardian — the government appointee who works with the Department of Health to try to ensure citizens’ confidential health data is safeguarded and used properly.
The NDG role does not have powers of enforcement, so cannot launch a formal investigation into the data-sharing arrangement, but a spokeswoman told TechCrunch the NDG is “considering how data was shared by the Royal Free [NHS Trust] with Google DeepMind”.
“Dame Fiona [Caldicott, the NDG] and her independent advisory panel have asked for and received information about the project, which is currently being considered to assess whether any guidance or advice from the National Data Guardian would be of assistance to this or similar projects,” the spokeswoman added.
The NDG will be publishing minutes of a meeting it held earlier this year with DeepMind and the Royal Free tomorrow — we’ll update this post with a link once the document is online. Update: The relevant paragraph from the minutes is as follows:
The same Royal Free-DeepMind data-sharing agreement is already being investigated by the UK’s data protection watchdog, the ICO, which confirmed to TechCrunch today that its probe remains ongoing.
An ICO spokesperson said: “We are in contact with the National Data Guardian about this matter and we continue to make enquiries of the Royal Free in relation to the data shared with Google DeepMind.”
“Any organisation processing or using people’s sensitive personal information must do so in accordance with the Data Protection Act,” the ICO spokesperson added.
At the time of writing neither DeepMind nor the Royal Free had responded to a request for comment on the NDG’s action. Update: In a joint statement the pair said:
NHS data-sharing and due process
This is just the latest regulatory bump in the road for the data-sharing agreement between DeepMind and the Trust — which was inked last September and publicly announced in February this year; the first such collaboration between the Google-owned company and the NHS. (DeepMind has since announced another collaboration, with a different NHS Trust: Moorfields Eye Hospital).
The Royal Free data-sharing agreement has been criticized for the amount of patient identifiable data being shared (especially as, unlike the Moorfields collaboration, the patient data is also not anonymized). Data being shared under the agreement includes real-time inpatient data from the Trust’s three hospitals across multiple departments, as well as historical in-patient data going back five years.
The Royal Free Trust and DeepMind have maintained that patient consent to the sharing of the data in this instance can be implied (rather than explicitly obtained), because they say they are using the data for so-called “direct patient care”. Which means a clinician helping an individual patient with their own care.
However the app the data is used to power — called Streams — targets a particular condition, called Acute Kidney Injury — and it is inevitable that not every patient whose data has been shared with DeepMind will go on to develop and/or be treated for AKI by a clinician at the Royal Free’s hospitals.
Streams has also only been used for three user tests so far which TechCrunch has learned entailed it being used it in parallel to other clinical decision-support processes. The app itself was not used to make any decisions about patient care during these tests.
All of which is to say that so far the NHS patient medical records shared with DeepMind for Streams have only been used to further the development of the software itself. So quite how R&D of a decision-support app also constitutes ‘direct patient care’ — the necessary threshold required for sharing data without explicit patient consent, in this instance — remains unclear. In more extensive user tests of the UI of the app DeepMind deployed fake data. But in the three user tests in the Royal Free hospitals real-world patient medical records were used.
A spokeswoman for the NDG said the body does not generally comment on individual cases, and further noted that in this instance it cannot comment because it is currently considering the arrangement — having contacted DeepMind and the Royal Free to provide details to its panel of experts earlier this year, back in May.
It is possible the NDG will gain more formal advice powers in future, given the role is relatively new — set up in November 2014, following another unrelated data-sharing controversy, and with the UK government only publishing its response to a consultation on the role’s remit and powers this summer.
Once the NDG gains statutory powers, it will mean NHS organisations will need to consider any formal advice when they are drawing up data-sharing agreements with outside entities, such as DeepMind. (At present there are only a set of Caldicott principles that NHS Trusts are supposed to take into account when making decisions about whether and how to share patient data — but it’s up to individual Trusts to interpret these guidelines.)
The UK’s ICO and the CQC (Care Quality Commission) remain the two existing bodies with enforcement powers in this area. One of which, the ICO, continues to investigate the Royal Free-DeepMind data-sharing agreement, as noted above.
Earlier this year it also emerged that DeepMind and the Royal Free had not registered the Streams app as a medical device with the relevant regulatory body, the MHRA, prior to testing it in hospitals. The pair was subsequently contacted by the MHRA and told they did need to register the app. The last of the three user tests of Streams was stopped on the same day, May 11 — after only three days of testing. (In February the app was tested for a week, between February 6 and 12; with the first test, in December, also lasting three days, from 12 to 14.)
The Streams app remains out of commission for now, although the pair have said they are committed to deploying it in future — i.e. once they have registered it with the MHRA.
Announcing DeepMind’s Moorfields research project last month, co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, referred back to the Royal Free collaboration — tacitly acknowledging the not-so-smooth sailing of the project in an almost-but-not-quite mea culpa moment.
“Treating this data with respect really matters,” he wrote in a Medium post entitled ‘Our commitment to the NHS‘. “There are different authorities that give different types of approvals and oversight for NHS data use: HSCIC, HRA, MHRA, ICO, Caldicott Guardians, and many, many more. We’re committed to working with all these groups, and making sure with their help that we get it right.”
In a recent statement provided to TechCrunch a DeepMind spokesperson again defended how NHS patient data is being shared under its agreement with the Royal Free:
The Royal Free and DeepMind continue to refuse to disclose the exact number of clinicians involved in testing Streams thus far. Nor will they specify how many patients passed through the hands of those clinicians during the user tests of the app. So it remains impossible to quantify the reach of the app vs the amount of patient identifiable data being shared to power it.

740,Darrell Etherington,"Shopify is launching its retail hardware and point-of-sale app for merchants in the UK. The reader supports tap, chip and swipe payments, letting retailers accept both contactless and traditional card-based payments, and the free app works in tandem with the reader device on either iPhone or iPad.
The Shopify app and reader combo means sellers can accept a range of payment options at festivals, pop-up shops, or in permanent stores, and it also ties the in-store shopping experience to a merchant’s online store, if they’re using Shopify to power their e-commerce.
Shopify’s card reader hardware costs £59 and is available for pre-order today, with a limited time discount of £20. The app is free to use, as mentioned, with credit card rates starting at 1.6 percent with no per purchase fee.
“The UK is Shopify’s second largest market,” Hailey Coleman, Product Growth Manager at Shopify, told TechCrunch via email. “The launch of the Shopify POS app and card reader provides small business owners an easy and secure way to accept payments anywhere. Now merchants in the UK can run their entire business with Shopify.”

741,Natasha Lomas,"Mozilla has invested in Cliqz, an anti-tracking browser with a pro-privacy built-in ‘quick search’ feature. The startup currently targets web users in German-speaking countries — where it has amassed more than 1 million active users on desktop and mobile for its Firefox-based browser and browser extension, since being founded back in 2008.
Cliqz founder and CEO Jean-Paul Schmetz tells TechCrunch the plan is to take Cliqz to other countries in future — although he did not specify a timeframe for that expansion. He also wasn’t commenting in more detail on the aims of the Mozilla partnership, at this stage.  
The size of Mozilla’s investment is not being disclosed either but the pair said today that it becomes a strategic minority investor. The Munich-based startup has been majority-owned by international media and tech company Hubert Burda Media since 2013.
The Cliqz browser, which is also available as an extension for Mozilla’s Firefox browser, has its own search index — which the startup says sets it apart from pro-privacy rival DuckDuckGo, for example.
Schmetz argues that pro-privacy browsers that don’t have their own index — another example is U.K. startup Oscobo, which licenses search results from Bing/Yahoo — are likely to be passing users’ IP addresses to the search providers when they send queries. Making them rather less private, given how IP addresses can be used to track individual’s web usage.
Cliqz has also built its own anti-tracking technology which does not rely on block-lists (as a service like Disconnect does), but rather works by community consensus filtering of unsafe content.
Another flagship feature for Cliqz is a built-in quick search which lets users search directly in the browser so they don’t need to “detour” to a separate search engine, as they put it. It’s not a fully fledged page of detailed search results but returns a selection of suggested websites — with Cliqz arguing it is useful for “navigation searches”, which of course make up the vast majority of search clicks.
“If for example Cliqz users would like to carry out extensive research, they can easily forward their search to the additional search engine within the browser. They then only need to use search engine results (leaving data and seeing adverts in the process) if they really need them,” adds Cliqz’s Thomas Konrad.
The Cliqz search engine is fed by user data to improve its recommendations. However it says community contributions to its web stats have “technically guaranteed anonymity” — noting its claims can be audited via third parties thanks to an open source code base.
The Cliqz browser for Mac and Windows launched in March this year, and is built on Mozilla’s open source Firefox framework. It’s also available on mobile, as an iOS or Android app. The Cliqz Firefox extension launched earlier, in June 2014.
What’s the business model?
So how does a browser that does not harvest and track user data propose to make money? By also keeping monetization efforts local to the users’ device — via a Cliqz Offers app, currently in the works, with a push rather than pull structure for sending relevant offers out to users.
The Offers app works by analysing browser data (such as browsing history) to detect a user’s interests but doing so locally, on their device. The Cliqz Offers server broadcasts all offers available — and each users’ Offers app only pulls in what is relevant for them. The browser then displays the offer, so Cliqz says this privacy-by-design structure means that “no interest signal or other data will ever leave the browser”.
“The communication between the Cliqz Offers Application and the Cliqz Offers Server doesn’t contain any personal or personally identifiable information and is routed via a proxy server to guarantee anonymity,” adds Konrad. “Personal data stay where they belong: on the device, in the ownership and under the full control of the user. With Cliqz Offers, Cliqz will prove that targeting users by their interests is not in contradiction to privacy and that a free product is possible without exploiting personal data.”
“Our business model does not need tracking because we are on the users device and their intents/interests remain there. The advantage of the browser is that it doesn’t need to track server-side,” notes Schmetz.
“Mozilla is the ideal company for Cliqz to work with because we both believe in an open Internet where people have control over their data. Data and search are our core competencies and it makes us proud to contribute our search and privacy technologies to the Mozilla ecosystem,” he adds in a statement.
Also commenting in the investment in a statement, Mozilla SVP Mark Mayo added: “Mozilla is excited to work with Cliqz because we see how their products align with the Mozilla mission. We are proud to help advance the privacy-focused innovation from Cliqz through this strategic investment in their company.”",2016-08-23,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/p1040681.jpg?w=738,"cliqz,browser-extension","Mozilla invests in Germany’s Cliqz, a private search browser"
742,Devin Coldewey,"A study from Carnegie Mellon University and subsequent analysis by the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation indicate that the U.K.’s blockage of more than 50 websites was indeed effective at reducing piracy, but neither addresses the fundamental problems with the approach.
April saw the publication of “Website Blocking Revisited: The effect of the UK November 2014 Blocks on Consumer Behavior,” a follow-up study to an earlier paper; both attempt to quantify how, if at all, these blocks affected traffic at both piratical and legal media services.

At any rate, the study concludes that the blocks are successful, though seemed to deter mainly casual pirates, creating a small but meaningful increase in the use of legal alternatives. Being an academic paper with a fixed purpose, however, it doesn’t ascend to the higher-level issues brought up by the practice — nor does it need to, those things being outside the scope of the research.
But the ITIF decided to take the baton and run with it, using the CMU paper as the primary source in a second report entitled “How Website Blocking Is Curbing Digital Piracy Without ‘Breaking the Internet’.”
It accurately describes the effectiveness of the blocks, but praises the idea while neglecting to seriously address the issues that attend this type of manipulation of the web.
The concerns of “copyright minimalists” and “internet exceptionalists” are mentioned, but dismissed.
While it is indeed unrealistic to think of the internet and web as some kind of elevated place unconnected with the vagaries of the physical realm, that is a disingenuous way to frame the perspective of those who espouse the view that the online world should be regulated differently.
There are fundamental differences to activity online: global accessibility, infinite reproduction of goods, anonymity and pseudonymity and so on. These make for a unique environment that requires unique approaches in order to establish the rule of law — or even define it.
Certainly it is simpler to attempt to apply existing laws to internet institutions; it was simpler to do that with business models, too, and companies have learned since the early days of the web that the old methods need to be rethought and at the very least hybridized with more forward-thinking ones that acknowledge the realities of the online world.
Shortly afterwards comes this reassuring passage:
Sounds familiar, doesn’t it? Sure, these tools/policies/laws could be abused, but don’t worry about that. There’s loads of oversight, and the people in charge of the work are trustworthy public servants.
I don’t think anyone out there takes this kind of promise seriously after the many, varied and repeated abuses perpetrated by everyone from ISPs to copyright holders to government agencies — to say nothing of those done by overreaching police, which is another story with a similar beginning. What trust we did give has been squandered, and we have no reason to believe we should offer it again.
Fighting piracy is a worthwhile pursuit, and it is being approached by multiple angles and parties. Substantive regulation that strengthens the ability of copyright holders to take down infringing material quickly and easily is something few people will oppose. But the legitimizing of tools to block arbitrary web addresses or snoop on and redirect ordinary traffic, however effective or ostensibly well-administrated they are, simply is not something anyone who supports a free and open web can allow.",2016-08-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/piracy.jpg?w=738,"censorship,united-kingdom,piracy","Report assesses UK’s ISP-level blocks of piracy sites as effective, but glosses over risks"

Its new Octopus Labs will concentrate on FinTech startups specifically, with the move coming just as the U.K. government has been pressing the financial sector to provide more innovation in its services, such as fully mobile banking. Octopus Labs will aim to ‘self-build’ solutions based on gaps they see in the market.

744,Romain Dillet,"French startup Whyd started off as a social network for music lovers but recently announced that it would switch its focus for a hardware project. The company just unveiled this secret hardware project — it’s a high-fidelity connected speaker that combines voice recognition with all music streaming services out there.
The company isn’t doing a Kickstarter. Instead, Whyd is accepting pre-orders on its website for $299, with a shipping date around the end of the year. After the pre-order period, Whyd expects to sell its speaker for $499.
“The home wireless speaker market is big and crowded,” co-founder Gilles Poupardin told me. “This market is dramatically shifting right now. Software and voice-control interface are redefining the entire category.”

So what makes this speaker different from the 458 other speakers out there? It starts with the design. The bold, pill-shaped design will stand out in your living room. I don’t think everyone will like it, but it’s definitely not a boring design. Whyd will sell five different pastel colors. The speaker doesn’t ship with a battery so you’ll have to plug it your wall at all times.
The Whyd speaker connects over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, works with AirPlay and Spotify Connect, and can stream music from many different music streaming services out of the box. Whyd is compatible with Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud, Tidal, Deezer and Google Play Music.
But the main differentiating factor is that Whyd has been working on natural language processing, integrating with Google Cloud Speech and optimizing for music playback. The company bundled multiple microphones and optimized them for long-range queries with noise cancelling technology. This way, you can launch a playlist, play a specific song or look up an artist with your voice. If you want to play an obscure remix on SoundCloud, you don’t have to dig around in the SoundCloud app, you can look it up with your voice. Think about it as a sort of Amazon Echo, but with a better sound and a focus on music.
“Whyd is the only speaker that combines a beautiful design, high-quality audio and voice control. We’re committed to build the best speaker for the streaming generation.” co-founder Jie Meng-Gerard told me.

745,Natasha Lomas,"Uber is taking legal action to try to block forthcoming regulatory changes in London that could impact its ability to recruit drivers onto its platform — including a new requirement for drivers to have passed a written English language test in order to operate a private hire vehicle.
In January the regulatory body Transport for London confirmed there would be a formal English language requirement for drivers, as part of a modernization of the rules governing operators.
This followed a TfL consultation last fall on a raft of possible changes to the rules that would have placed even more stringent limitations on on-demand taxi app operators — such as imposing a five-minute wait time prior to pick-ups and outlawing the displaying of real-time vehicle locations within an app.
Uber kicked up a stink about the proposals, looping its users in as lobbyists by messaging them to sign a petition against changes it claimed would destroy the Uber “you know and love”. After which TfL published a much watered down list of requirements to be taken forward.
However, earlier this summer, the regulator further tweaked the incoming rules — including specifying that the formal English requirement be a written English language test.
The requirement states that from October 1 new applicants and licensees renewing their licence who are not from a majority English-speaking country must present a valid English language certificate with a B1 level of English on the Common European Framework as part of their new or renewal licence application.
“Anyone who does not have the appropriate level of English will not be granted a licence,” TfL adds.
TfL says the written English language requirement is necessary not only to ensure good communication with passengers but for drivers to be able to brief them on public safety issues and to read and understand safety and travel information sent to them by the regulatory.
It notes the proposal for a formal English language requirement was supported by 80 per cent of the 20,000 respondents in its consultation.
Uber clearly disagrees, arguing the written test goes far beyond what is needed to operate a private hire vehicle, and claiming it even exceeds the standard required to achieve British citizenship.
The company is also unhappy about several additional requirements TfL has added to the updated rules. Specifically it is challenging a stipulation that taxi companies must operate a London-based call centre for passengers to call if they need more information, and a requirement that drivers have commercial insurance through the year, even for any months they are not driving.
A fourth sticking point for Uber is a TfL requirement the company inform it of forthcoming changes to its app, which it argues will slow down the rollout of new features.
Uber has now submitted an application for a judicial review of TfL’s rules in the high court in England.
“This legal action is very much a last resort. We’re particularly disappointed that, after a lengthy consultation process with Transport for London, the goalposts have moved at the last minute and new rules are now being introduced that will be bad for both drivers and tech companies like Uber,” said Tom Elvidge, Uber London’s general manager, in a statement.
Uber has once again sought to recruit its users to apply pressure to regulators on its behalf, sending an email to London users earlier this month urging them to email the city’s mayor with their objections to what it dubbed the “bureaucratic new rules”.
“Fewer drivers will mean longer waiting times or no cars when you need them most,” Uber’s email warns London users, while arguing the changes also “threaten the livelihood of thousands of drivers”.
Responding to Uber’s legal challenge in its own statement, a TfL spokesman said: “We responded to Uber’s letter and will be robustly defending the legal proceedings brought by them in relation to the changes to private hire regulations.  These have been introduced to enhance public safety when using private hire services and we are determined to create a vibrant taxi and private hire market with space for all providers to flourish.”",2016-08-17,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/shutterstock_300817475.jpg?w=738,"regulations,car-sharing,london",Uber files legal challenge to incoming rule changes in London
746,Natasha Lomas,"Let’s be honest, players of Pokemon Go aren’t going to care a Joltik or a Flabébé about the app permissions required to roam their neighbourhoods garnering the disproving glances of seniors as they fling invisible poke balls at the rose bushes.
But maybe they should — given the long list of permissions the app requires for its geocaching game of augmented reality and real-life activity fun to function, as flagged by Twitter user and security engineer Jason Strange…
As Strange goes on to point out, the permissions are almost as extensive as required by Google’s earlier (massively less successful) location-based multiplayer game, Ingress…
The similarity of the two permissions lists is not too surprising, given that Niantic Labs, the Google division which made Ingress, is also the maker of Pokemon Go. And Niantic was spun out of Google last year — albeit with Mountain View remaining a backer of the company.
Albeit, Ingress was (at least initially) aimed at adults. And Pokemon is (at least in theory) a game for kids.
Expansive data-capture permissions seem a whole lot more creepy when the surface entity doing the capturing has a business model powered by data-mining its users (i.e. Google). Vs a business model powered by mining its users’ nostalgia for games they played when they were kids (i.e. Nintendo).
But actually, in Pokemon Go’s case, there’s not necessarily a huge difference — given that Google remains in the loop as a third party backer of Niantic.
Niantic’s privacy policy for Pokemon Go notes it may share “aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for research and analysis, demographic profiling, and other similar purposes”.
So it’s prudent to expect some of your location data to end up in Google’s hands. We’ve asked Niantic directly about this and will update this post with any response.
The company also notes it may disclose information about users (including children under 13 who have been authorized by their parents to use the app) —
So couple the above statement with the game’s precise location tracking and ability to perform audio fingerprinting (thanks to its access to the camera/microphone) and you have an app that could easily be subpoenaed to track down/snoop on a person of interest, as various others have pointed out…
Will players of Pokemon Go be worried about the long list of permissions they are agreeing to? Probably the closest most will get to noticing/caring will be the toll persistent location tracking takes on their device battery life.
Preventing the phone from sleeping and sucking continuously on GPS will do that.
Still it is persistent location tracking as an opt-in service — to power a location-based AR game. It needs at least some of these permissions to function. But the flip-side is you’re potentially handing over masses of personal data — plus a powerful tracking capability — just because you want to play a game.
Call it a bunch of pretty aggressive permissions dressed up in Pokemon kawaii. Faustian pacts never looked so cute.
(Sidenote: some of the app permissions Pokemon Go requires on Android aren’t available on iOS — yet the game still functions within Apple’s mobile ecosystem so…)
Another privacy/security risk being, at least momentarily, accentuated by Pokemon Go’s popularity is down to its so-far limited geographical release (officially launched in the US, Australia and New Zealand) — meaning Pokemon fans in countries where the app can’t yet be downloaded via standard channel might be tempted to try sideloading it.
And, yes, already a backdoored Pokemon Go Android app has turned up.
So it can be a small step from wanting to ‘catch them all’ to, in fact, catching a malicious remote access tool. Which obviously wasn’t the Pokemon you were looking for.
The backdoored Pokemon Go APK includes even more extensive app permissions than the legitimate APK — including the ability to make calls and send SMSes (which could be used by the app to rack up premium rate fees in the background), as well as the ability to record audio, read your web history and more. It also, like Ingress, demands to run on startup.
But when you compare the lists of permissions the backdoored malware version doesn’t look so very different from the real deal.
For the record, here’s our upload of the app permissions list of the current version of the (official) Pokemon Go app in the US Android Play store:

747,Jon Russell,"Line, the messaging app from Asia famed for its cutesy yet expressive emoji-like stickers, is on track to hold 2016’s largest tech public listing. The company today announced pricing for its dual Japan-U.S. IPO, which could raise as much as $1.14 billion.
The year started quietly for tech IPOs but the recent listing of Twilio has reopened the window. Line has priced its shares at ¥3,300, which represents the top end of its range thanks to high demand. The company is all set to begin trading in New York on Thursday and in Tokyo on Friday — the Wall Street Journal has more information:
Line, which is owned by Korean internet giant Naver, counts 218 million monthly active users worldwide, two-thirds of whom are based in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia. The company plans to use the new capital to go after other markets in Asia and raise its profile for potential expansion plans elsewhere in the world.
The company grossed $1 billion in revenue for the first time last year, making it one of the most lucrative app developers in the industry. But there are some notable points: it isn’t profitable, nearly 90 percent of its revenue comes from its native Japan, while more than 60 percent of its income is from its games. Stickers, which the company is well-known for, account for around one-quarter of its sales — that’s around $270 million in 2015.",2016-07-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0151.jpg?w=738,"tech-ipo,ipo,naver,line",Chat app Line targets $1.14B raise in what could be 2016’s largest tech IPO
748,Jon Russell,"Fintech companies are continuing to draw interest from investors in Asia. The latest company to pull in financing is Airwallex, a China-Australia startup that specializes in cross-border transactions.
The Melbourne-headquartered company this week announced a $3 million seed round led by Chinese investment Gobi Partners, with participation from angel investors Huashan Capital One and Billy Tam, CEO of China’s Easylink Payments.
The startup aims to ease the headache and cost of cross-border purchases by enabling consumers to buy items from outside of their country using their local currency. In essence it uses the same principles as London-based Transferwise in that it reduces the costs that both merchants and consumers eat up when is the two parties are using different currencies.
Airwallex CEO and co-founder Jack Zhang came upon the idea after growing tired of the additional cost of importing goods from overseas for a coffee shop business that he invested in while working for banks in Australia. Zhang, formerly with ANZ and NAB, decided that tech could provide a better solution and he founded Airwallex alongside four other co-founders, including CTO Jacob Dai and COO Lucy Yueting Liu, who spent time working foreign exchange for Barclays Bank.

Zhang told TechCrunch in an interview that this pre-Series A round was wrapped up particularly quickly, taking just two weeks to close.
“There’s a big opportunity here in Asia especially as the e-commerce is really taking off worldwide,” he said. “E-commerce players aren’t satisfied in their own country, and want to go global.”
The company uses inter-bank exchanges to trade forex at a mid-market rate, something which Zhang said can save its clients as much as 90 percent on their foreign exchange rates.
The service is in a closed beta right now and is expected to launch within a month, it is currently waiting on regulatory approval in Australia. The concept is similar to Braintree or Stripe, a system that sits behind the merchant — invisible to end-customers — through which payment is made. Airwallex itself will make money via a transaction fee based on the volume of payments it handles.
The company has around 20 people in Melbourne, its main office, with a dozen staff in China and a handful based in Hong Kong. Zhang said the new funds will be used mainly on marketing, hiring and product development, Airwallex is also developing a wallet solution that will enable customers and merchants to hold multiple currencies at the same time.
China, Hong Kong and Australia are the young company’s initial focus markets, but it has plans to expand to Singapore, Japan and Korea. The company is aiming to raise a Series A round before the end of the year to help finance that expansion.",2016-07-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/cross-border.jpg?w=738,"hong-kong,australia,china,fintech",Asia Pacific cross-border payment startup Airwallex lands $3M
749,Jon Russell,"Coinbase, one of the world’s largest bitcoin companies, has set its sights on Japan after landing funding from a range of Japanese investors, including Bank of Tokyo and a firm that helped Twitter enter the country.
The U.S. company announced that it has partnered with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU) to “support [its] long-term international expansion efforts” — in other words, expand its services to Japan. Coinbase also disclosed that it secured investment from BTMU, Mitsubishi UFJ Capital (MUCAP), and Sozo Ventures, a U.S.-Japanese fund that counts Twitter and LinkedIn among its investments.
Coinbase offers a consumer wallet service for buying bitcoin and spending it across various merchant partners, while it also operates a platform for institutional investors. The company has raised more than $100 million from investors, including its most recent $75 million round led by DFJ in January 2015. Reuters reported that the investment from Japan is $10.5 million. [Update: that $10.5 million is confirmed by a U.S. filing.]
The San Francisco-based company expanded to Singapore, its first port of call in Asia, last year, but it doesn’t currently have a target for when it will open an exchange in Japan — a move that will require the nod from regulators.
“While we do not yet offer digital currency exchange services in Japan, we are committed to continued international expansion and look forward to working with BTMU to support this focus in key markets in Asia and globally,” Coinbase said in a statement.
Japan is most notable in the bitcoin world for being the home of Mt. Gox, the controversial company that self-combusted two years ago following rumors of theft and fraud. These days, Japan is home to a number of exchanges — including Bitflyer, Kraken, Quoine and Coincheck. The country passed new laws governing bitcoin earlier this year in response to the Mt. Gox meltdown.",2016-07-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/photo-01-06-2016-15-52-27.jpg?w=738,"japan,coinbase",Coinbase eyes Japan expansion after landing $10.5M from Bank of Tokyo and others
750,Ingrid Lunden,"As large platforms like Facebook and Apple position themselves as the new go-to places to read news, an independent app that started in Japan has landed a new round of funding to raise its own game. SmartNews — a news aggregation app that works with some 1,500 publications and selects stories for you based on your reading activity in the app — has raised another $38 million in a Series D round of funding. 
The startup is now approaching 20 million downloads and will be using the funding to continue growing that user base, as well as its overall revenues, especially outside of its home market. It will also use the investment for hiring and expanding its machine learning-based news-combing technology.
The investment — led by the Development Bank of Japan, with SMBC Venture Capital and Japan Co-Invest L.P. participating — brings the total raised by SmartNews to about $90 million. The company isn’t disclosing its valuation but I understand from reliable sources that it is between $500 million and $600 million, post money. That’s a considerable bump on last year, when it raised funding at a $320 million valuation. 
Interestingly, when SmartNews raised that previous Series C, co-founder Kaisei Hamamoto told me that it was in part to expand into the U.S., where it would likely be raising money next. As it turned out, Japan has remained SmartNews’ single biggest market with 10 million users, and so that’s where investors seemed most interested.
“Just as important as the funding is the continuing expansion of the Japanese business and the ramping up of our U.S. business,” said Rich Jaroslavsky, the startup’s VP of content and ‘chief journalist.’ “We’re feeling very good about things.” 
He added that while the U.S. and other international markets are still advertising-free, the Japanese operation is big enough that it makes sense to monetize.
“Business has been doing so well in Japan that it has diminished any pressure to start monetizing in the U.S., and that’s wonderful,” he said. 
 It has thrown itself into that model with inline advertising, video ads, and deals with publishers to sell ads against “SmartViews”, which is SmartNews’s zippy-loading equivalent of Google’s AMP or Facebook’s Instant Articles. (“We had AMP before AMP,” is how Jaroslavsky describes it flatly.)
While the printed newspaper industry has undeniably been in decline, today we’re ironically in something of a news renaissance that is being carried out in the digital world. We get news instantly; and there is a lot of it to read, sometimes too much.
Some of the biggest newspaper brands have recreated audiences online, but the bigger development has been about how we discover that news today, and that has been about shifting the consumption platform away from those direct news sources and towards aggregators bringing in several sources at once.
But just as there are a ton of primary news sources, there are also a hefty number of aggregators, all taking slightly different approaches. SmartNews competes against biggies like Facebook tapping into its vast social network user base (and shifting priorities as a platform, it seems); Apple News, which found an instant audience by virtue of being preinstalled on its iPhone and iPad devices; and Flipboard, a first-mover with a loyal and large number of readers.
That’s before you consider a number of interesting smaller and newer services like Nuzzel, Quibb and Owler that also aggregate, recommend and surface things people are writing and talking about.
SmartNews is somewhat distinctive in that sea of competition, in that the company has built all of its algorithms for sorting news from the bottom up. As such it lets those algorithms do all the legwork to surface, suggest, and curate. This is not the case, for example, at Facebook or Apple News, where humans are very much involved in the selection process, sometimes to controversial ends.
“My title is chief journalist, and we chose that rather than editor in chief for a specific reason,” Jaroslavsky told me. “If I were to call myself EIC it would imply editing. But while I am a journalist and employing journalistic skills, it’s not to select stories but to work with engineers to recognise the algorithm and make it smarter and recognize how to find good stories.”
In fact, it’s done the same with its ad products, and that is another unique selling point for SmartNews in Japan. “Most publishers to do not have an easy plug and play for ads, and so we’ve really become one of the more prominent ad networks for news space in Japan.”
All this adds up to a good business for SmartNews at home. As it continues to build that business there, we’ll continue to watch to see if it will be enough to break through in more oversaturated markets like the U.S.",2016-07-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/smartnews.png?w=702,"news-aggregation,smartnews","News discovery app SmartNews nabs another $38M, now valued at $500M-$600M"

As the Chinese economy has boomed in the last decade, millions of people have entered the middle class. And the Chinese aren’t just getting wealthier, they’re getting fitter. China, it seems, is in the midst of a workout craze — and that represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for venture investors to back emerging health and wellness technology companies.
In particular, China’s vast millennial population of young people aged 18-35 — more than 385 million strong — is hitting the gym, running marathons, participating in exercise classes and playing and watching sports in record numbers. This generation, the first to grow up in the “new” capitalistic China, wants far more from life than their parents did.
In keeping with the Maslow hierarchy of needs, they aren’t content with simply a roof over their head and food on the table, as were previous generations who lived in times of communist control and scarcity. China’s highly educated, internet-savvy, global-traveling young people want it all — and that includes being fit. Young women, in particular, are eager to stay trim and cultivate a toned look, sharing photos of their slim physiques on social media.
Chinese young people have caught the fitness bug so much that gym and health-club revenue in China has nearly doubled during the past five years, and is expected to total more than $5 billion this year, according to research firm IBIS World. Though that falls short of the nearly $25 billion figure in the U.S., China’s health and fitness industry is far younger and growing far faster.
“Only a couple of years ago, it would have been difficult to find Chinese women breaking a sweat while lifting weights or huffing and puffing through strenuous workouts,” read a recent Wall Street Journal article about the Chinese fitness craze. Now, companies like Nike, Under Armour, Adidas and The North Face are opening stores and growing sales in China at a breakneck clip.
When China adopts a craze, the number of people joining is staggering, just by sheer population size. That’s why the VC industry is so bullish on investing in sports and fitness startups, in particular in three categories.
Fitness and health apps. This broad category encompasses wellness apps, fitness trackers, content and communities and any other mobile-driven consumer wellness platform. These apps are particularly popular among the 280 million people aged 15-25 in China, who have grown up on their smartphones. Chinese youth are fashion-focused, want to look good and feel healthy and are eager to try global health crazes like yoga, pilates and marathons.
They use apps to watch fitness videos, take part in group workouts, track their progress and monitor their eating. Apps that make fitness game-like, goal-oriented and fun are hugely popular with Chinese millennials. Companies in this category include social workout app Keep (a GGV investment), Daily Yoga, run-tracker Codoon and Yuepaoquan, which helps users find and schedule running groups. Increasingly, Chinese young people are becoming sports spectators, too, and enjoy using apps to follow and comment on their favorite teams.
Smart fitness and connected sports devices. From wearables that track steps taken or calories burned to devices that help improve your golf swing or soccer kicks, Chinese consumers love to collect data on themselves in their quest toward fitness. As investors, backing these types of device companies is also a “data play.”
Once device companies figure out ways to use this data to help people become healthier, save money, lose weight or reach other goals, they’ll become far more than “gadget” companies and more like consumer market research firms. Companies leading the pack in this respect in China include both U.S. and Chinese firms, such as Fitbit, Mi Band, Misfit and Nike+.
Freedom and the great outdoors. Chinese young people today believe in an ethos of freedom. They don’t want to be tied down to owning a house or car, and they want to be free to choose their own friends, hobbies and careers. This ethos extends to how Chinese young people play sports and engage in outdoor recreation.
Tech startups that facilitate people “getting outside” will be a huge market — everything from apps that help consumers find local soccer and basketball leagues to participate in, to those bringing people together for outdoor bootcamp training sessions.
What’s more, this category extends to frontier-tech companies such as GGV investment Niu, maker of an electric scooter popular among urban Chinese millennials who use them not just to navigate the clogged streets of Beijing, but also to get away from the smog and stress. It’s common to see people piloting Niu scooters to the mountains and beaches on the weekends, because hiking, rock climbing and surfing are all outdoor sports young Chinese consumers are eager to experience. Taiwanese company Gogoro has likewise launched a smart scooter, as well as a battery charging infrastructure to go with it.
When you see the gyms and pilates studios dotting Beijing streets or legions of young people hiking mountain trails in their North Face jackets, it’s easy to forget that just three decades ago, young people in China were more worried about getting enough food ration coupons than they were about getting toned enough to wear a new Lululemon outfit.
But China has changed at an astonishing rate, and its young people today are just like their counterparts in other developed countries — hungry for self fulfillment and personal success. As Chinese millennials continue to look for new ways to become healthier and happier, investors are clearly banking on the China fitness boom to not only continue, but to accelerate.",2016-07-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/gettyimages-541906208.jpg?w=738,"healthtech,fitness,venture-capitalists,china",VCs are betting on the great Chinese fitness boom
752,Jon Russell,"Didi Chuxing, the taxi booking app that is beating Uber in China, has added a number of safety features to its service including an SOS button for its 300 million registered users.
The company, which was formed by a merger between China’s top two taxi apps last year and recently closed a $7.3 billion funding round, announced today that it has implemented changes to “enhance user safety and protection” of passengers across the 400 cities that it serves in China.
Most notable is perhaps the SOS button, which, with one click, sends an alert to contacts that are reset by the passenger. Didi said also that, in the event that the button is activated, it has “trained Didi SOS Taskforce members” who can check in on the passenger in real-time, since their device automatically begins recording audio once they request help.
Uber added a similar panic button last year, initially in India following a passenger rape, in a rollout that also include real-time passenger location tracking. That’s another feature that Didi initiated today. Initially launched in beta in May, now all Didi passengers can share their location, estimated time of arrival, the vehicle license number and other information to friends via both the Didi app and popular chat services WeChat and QQ. Didi said that overseas users — who make use of its integration with Lyft in the U.S. and soon other allies in Asia — can access the feature while outside of China.
Didi also introduced its number masking feature across the whole of China, to help passengers retain their privacy while communicating with drivers, and it is rolling out “biometric driver authentication” to verify its drivers. That latter feature is similar to another that Uber uses currently, too. Uber China, the U.S. firm’s dedicated company in the country, introduced ‘selfie authentication’ to cut down on driver fraud back in April of this year.
Finally, also related to fraud and driver management, Didi announced a tie-in with local and national law agencies around background checks and driver screening. The company already conducts these checks but it (boldly) proclaimed that it is “the only ride-hailing platform in the industry to cooperate with relevant state departments in [China].” Take that Uber! Considering that many of these new features are already visible in Uber, we guess Didi needed to puff its chest out about something for this press announcement.
But, on a serious note, more safety features are only a good thing as taxi-on-demand and ride-sharing services continue to grow in popularity among consumers in China, the U.S. and the rest of the world.",2016-07-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/traffic-in-china.jpg?w=738,"ride-sharing,taxi-app,china,didi-chuxing","Didi Chuxing adds new safety features, including a passenger SOS button"
753,Jon Russell,"Alibaba has officially announced its move into the automobile space after it unveiled its first “internet car” in collaboration with SAIC, one of China’s big four state-owned automakers.
The RX5 is available for pre-order now, it’s priced upwards of RMB 148,800 ($22,300) with deliveries scheduled to start in August. The sports vehicle has been developed over the last two years as part of a joint venture between Alibaba and SAIC, which put a combined $160 million into the 50-50 project. It includes a new version of Alibaba’s Yun operating system to enable the car to connect to and tap into various internet services.
Alibaba raised a few examples of what that could mean in practical terms. It ranges from personalized greetings, music and preferred destinations based on settings that can be configured from a smartphone or wearable, to the ability to use Alibaba’s Alipay payments service to pay for parking spaces, fill up with gas or buy a coffee. It’s logical that Alibaba’s own services are a core part of possibility functionality, but the company said it wants to open YunOS to third parties, too.
On the entertainment side of things, the RX5 includes three LED screens and space for up to four detachable 360 degree cameras to record video and take photos — because IN-CAR SELFIES — and a smart rear view mirror. As you might expect, there’s support for voice controls while an onboard “intelligent” mapping system, the companies claim, will work without GPS or WiFi.
There’s no crazy, next-level ‘smart’ car features like autopilot, instead Alibaba is putting the focus on a shipping a connected car.

“What we are creating is not ‘internet in the car’, but a ‘car on the internet’. This is a significant milestone in the automobile industry. Smart operating systems become the second engine of cars, while data is the new fuel,” said Dr. Wang Jian, who is chairman of Alibaba’s ‘Technology Steering Committee.’
“Going forward, cars will become an important platform for internet services and smart hardware innovation. We will be embracing a world where everything is closely connected,” Wang added.
Alibaba is far from the only Chinese internet firm to get into cars. LeEco, formerly LeTv, is backing ambitious U.S. project Faraday Future and building a car of its own, while Baidu is one the front runners testing self-driving vehicles in both China and the U.S..
Alibaba is also a major shareholder in Didi Chuxing, the company that is beating Uber in China which recently landed a $1 billion investment from Apple as part of a gargantuan $7 billion round. It is unclear whether Alibaba will use that relationship and work with Didi to provide smart cars.

754,Jon Russell,"Alibaba has advanced its reach on mobile after it acquired one of China’s most prominent Android app stores, Wandoujia, in an undisclosed acquisition.
The deal was announced in Chinese only, and media in the country pegged it at around $200 million. (Alibaba declined to comment on that price when we asked.) That’s a significant amount, for sure, but it is nothing compared to the $1.9 billion that Baidu parted with to acquire 91 Wireless, China’s top Android app store, three years ago. Nonetheless, this purchase is notable for another reason: the rise and fall of valuations.
Wandoujia was reportedly valued at more than $1 billion in January 2014 when it landed a $120 million funding round led by SoftBank, however increased competition from carrier-run app stores and rivals like 91 Wireless and Qihoo 360, not to mention reports of internal conflict, appear to have impacted its development over the past two years.
Currently, Wandoujia comes in as China’s fifth largest app store, according to data from Analysys International, with around six percent marketshare. The startup was founded in 2009 by former Google China-er Junyu Wang and telecoms engineer Jack Feng, and it claimed 300 million users at the time of that SoftBank investment. Beyond apps, Wandoujia also offers mobile content and search products.
Independent app stores have flourished in China thanks to the blockage of Google services. While the U.S. company’s search engine is perhaps the most famous Google product not available in China, the Play Store is another critical Google pillar that is missing from the country, the world’s largest mobile market. Without the core Play Store, independent app stores took its place and have been hugely important points of contact for any international developer or startup wanting to get into China.
Now, Wandoujia will be made part of Alibaba’s mobile division, which includes browser-maker UC Web, which the company acquired two years ago.
It’s clear why Alibaba wants Wandoujia: an app store makes a useful addition to its existing ecosystem of mobile businesses and services. Beyond its e-commerce services — which are principally brand-focused TMall and Taobao marketplace, and sister payments service Alipay — Alibaba owns UC Web, China’s top video service Youku Tudou, and analytics service Umeng and more. Wandoujia has the potential to be a major distribution platform and channel through which it can engage and interact with Chinese consumers.
As is the case with Youku Tudou, which Alibaba bought for $3.5 billion, the company is aware that different kinds of media — such as entertainment, video and apps — can unlock commercial opportunities for its e-commerce business.",2016-07-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/139477700.jpg?w=738,"app-store,china,wandoujia",Alibaba snaps up Chinese Android app store Wandoujia
755,Jon Russell,"Twitter has been blocked in China since around 2009. That seriously hampered any hopes that the U.S. firm — which is struggling to grow its userbase worldwide — had in China, but the service does still have a hardcore base of loyalists who use it in the country.
Previous estimates have pegged Twitter’s China-based following as being as high as 35.5 million users, but the actual number appears to be much lower. According to a source inside Twitter, who spoke to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity, its service has around 10 million active users in China.
That number itself is an estimate, one that is used internally, because even Twitter isn’t fully sure. That’s because it is hugely challenging to tally up China-based users by virtue of them connecting to the service via VPN software which allows them to use an internet connection outside of China, thus bypassing the country’s web censorship system. So, a China-based user accessing Twitter on a VPN will show up as being located in the U.S., UK, Singapore or wherever else their VPN is set to.
“We do not comment on specific number of users in any country. Our consumer service is censored and blocked in mainland China today,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email.
Either way, the figure is small: 10 million represents a mere drop of Twitter’s 310 million total active users — it counts 65 million of those in the U.S., its largest single market, with the remaining 245 million overseas. It is also a tiny fraction of the 688 million internet users in the country, according to government data. That figure, taken from December 2015, means that, for the first time, over half of China’s population is now online.
Twitter has a growing business in China, anchored by an executive who controversially spent time in her early career working on military security for the government, but its userbase in China isn’t part of that. Local services like chat app WeChat, which contains social features and has multiple hundreds of millions of active users in China, and microblogging service Weibo are the dominant social media. Instead, Twitter makes money in China by offering Chinese companies and media a gateway to global audiences by advertising on its service. That’s exactly the strategy that Facebook employs, with both services proving to be popular advertising and distribution channels for China’s state-run media, which among the most lucrative clients.
“As a global platform, we are already engaged with advertisers, content providers and influencers across Greater China to help them reach audiences around the world. We are focusing on three Chinese business audiences that can leverage our global platform: continue to serve export advertisers, do more with publishers/creators, and reach out to developers,” Twitter added in a statement.
If it isn’t critical to its business, why is Twitter’s internal estimate for its China userbase worthy of note?
Well, it helps sketch out a figure for the number of people who use VPNs in China, an oft-influential section that includes journalists, activists, prominent business leaders and decision makers. It is hard to fully quantify this block of internet users, though, even with Twitter’s estimate. Not everyone using a VPN will use Twitter, but it is likely that a large portion of VPN and Twitter users overlap. Certainly you can’t use Twitter in China without a VPN.
In that respect, Twitter’s China estimate — while not mission-critical for Twitter’s business — gives a glimpse at the number of ‘global web consumers’ who leap over China’s Great Firewall of censorship to read and consume whatever they want on the internet.
“If there are 10 million Chinese on Twitter that is great news. Twitter is one of the last great bastions of relatively free speech. When was the last time 10 million Chinese could freely say what they feel, on any platform, without fear of reprisal?” Charlie Smith, one of the pseudonymous founders of anti-censorship group Great Fire, told TechCrunch via email.
Great Fire released a ranking index to give greater clarify around China-specific VPNs today, and Smith said he believes that “there are growing pockets of ordinary people who want to circumvent censorship so they can access whatever information they choose.”
“It’s fantastic that Twitter can provide us with an indication of how big this group might be,” the Great Fire founder added.
It is highly unlikely that Twitter will take the necessary steps that might get it unblocked in China — that would mean caving in to censorship demands and self-policing user content, as LinkedIn has done — while there’s already fierce competition in social media, so don’t expect that China-based user number to grow much any time soon.",2016-07-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/shutterstock_325058183.jpg?w=738,"censorshit,censorship,china",Twitter estimates that it has 10 million users in China
756,Jon Russell,"Using the internet in China is hard if you want to go beyond the Chinese web. Not only are many popular websites and services blocked in the country, such as Facebook or Twitter, but the general speed of international websites is painfully slow.
Some companies, like CloudFlare, are trying to fix this with architecture, but VPN (virtual personal network) software is the nearest thing to a sure-fire way to use non-Chinese internet in China. VPNs essentially build a tunnel to let you use the internet as if you are in another country, where, for example, Facebook isn’t blocked.
It’s the “nearest thing” and not a full a solution because, in many cases, regular run-of-the-mill VPN don’t work in China, where a very particular type is required. Even when you find one that does work in China, reliability is a major issue. The Chinese government has cracked down on VPNs and the web more than usual over the past two years or so, that has included nullifying popular services and, in one case, visiting a developer in person to have software shuttered.
Great Fire, the non-profit entity that we profiled last year which is dedicated to fighting internet restrictions in China, has launched a new service today that — it hopes — will provide a much-needed increase in clarity and guidance for finding VPNs that are effective in China.
Circumvention Central tests the speed and reliability of VPNs on actual websites not just servers, and on an ongoing basis. The result is that, rather than a static list or collection of VPNs that you could plump for, as you’ll see on many blogs and websites, Great Fire will provide a living, breathing rank of those that work best, and how they have performed over time.

The idea, Great Fire’s pseudonymous founders explained in a blog post, is to change the culture of “keeping quiet” about quality VPNs (for the fear that publicity will be the downfall) and enable anyone to find a solution that works.
The site already lists more than 10 services, most of which are familiar to Chinese internet users, and Great Fire said it intends to work with more VPN sellers and developers to increase the choice and also help make software perform better in China.
When I put it to them that placing all this valuable data in one place puts a target on VPN services, co-founder Charlie Smith — not a real name — argued that there is nothing new here.
“The authorities already know about all VPNs. It is naive to assume that sharing information about those that work will be helping them in their efforts. The authorities are the only ones who benefit from the secrecy surrounding quick and stable VPNs that work in China,” Smith wrote via email.
The final, important piece, of the news today is that the organization is aiming to make money itself. As of now, Great Fire relies on donations from anonymous individuals to keep doing what it does. That can be tricky. It seemed to catch the eye of the Chinese government last year following a media campaign — the upshot of which was an unprecedented high traffic DDOS on its webpages and Github account, which took Github down for days and generated huge server bills for Great Fire to cover. It managed to emerge from the situation, but things didn’t look good at one point.
“We want to reduce our reliance on these organizations and set GreatFire.org on a path of self-sustainability,” the founders, each of whom has their own job and doesn’t know one another outside of the project, wrote.
The company will use the site to resell VPN software via affiliate links on the site. So, if you find a service, clicking the link to purchase it will earn the organization a finder’s fee for sending your business to the VPN maker.

757,Megan Rose Dickey,"Uber China is repositioning itself as an all-in-one solution for transportation, food and entertainment. At TechCrunch Shanghai, Uber China VP of Operations and Regional General Manager of Central China Kate Wang showed off Uber’s new vision for China — one that includes two new offerings, UberLIFE and Uber + Travel, which will roll out across China this year.
All-in-one solutions are something the Chinese market demands. That’s what WeChat, the hot messaging app that sees 697 million active users worldwide every month, is all about. In addition to messaging, the app offers voice and video calling, payments, shopping, games and more. It seems that Uber, which has been blocked on WeChat, is taking a page or several from WeChat’s playbook. It’s worth noting that WeChat is owned by Tencent, which is an investor in Uber’s biggest rival, Didi Chuxing, formerly known as Didi Kuaidi.
In an analysis of data, Uber figured out that people still look at the Uber app for an additional 90 seconds when they’re in the car, so Uber wants to give people more to do when they’re inside the app. With Uber Life, passengers will get served up a digital magazine of sorts to connect them to sports events, art events, plays and other things going on in their local cities. Uber Life is intended to help people “live a better a life” and ultimately spend more time within Uber’s app.
With Uber+Travel, the idea is to connect people to everything they might need while traveling internationally — from boats to air balloons. In a promo video shown at TC Shanghai, we saw new services like UberBoat and UberBalloon, as well as logos for all of Uber’s partners in local cities.
“This reminds us that Uber is a global service serving global citizens,” Wang said. “It is rooted in each of the cities.”
With Uber+Travel, Uber can tap into its network of partners throughout the world to offer more of a seamless travel experience. Last year, Uber filed a patent for something called Uber Travel, which recommends travel itineraries. Wang also spoke about UberPASS, a package of rides that you can buy to use in different cities.
Earlier this month, Uber said it’s on course to become China’s most popular ride service within a year. Uber first entered China about two years ago, while Didi has been operating in China for four years. Since launching in China, Uber’s footprint has expanded from ten to 60 cities. Now, Wang said, Uber’s goal is to transform itself from a player in the car-hailing market “to a commerce service that understands life and a proper life.”",2016-06-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0073.jpg?w=738,didi-chuxing,Uber positions its China app as more than a ride-hailing service
758,Lucia Maffei,"The Seoul Metropolitan Government announced traffic and pedestrian signs alerting the danger of using smartphones while walking on the street, soon to be installed in five areas of the South Korean capital.
The safety campaign, implemented together with the National Police Agency, specifically targets kids, teenagers and young adults, the main users of smartphones in the country.
“The five areas where the pilot project will be implemented are Hongdae, City Hall, Yonsei University, Gangnam Station, and Jamsil Station, where there are many accidents and pedestrians in their 10-30s,” the Seoul Metropolitan Government website states.
Here is what those signs will look like:
With a population of 50.8 million, South Korea has the highest smartphone ownership rate worldwide, according to statistics published by Pew Research Center in 2016. The fact that the country is also one of the most active smartphone manufacturers in the world is not a coincidence – it’s the headquarters of LG Electronics, not to mention Samsung Electronics in Suwon, south of the capital.
“I saw many people using smartphones while walking and commuting, but I don’t think it’s just Korea,” said Jenny Lee, who had been living in Seoul for the past five years before enrolling in a university in Illinois. “People in the U.S. are also similar,” she added.
The phenomenon of walking and texting, sadly, is probably nothing new to anyone who regularly uses public transportation. To prevent accidents, other cities in Asia, in Europe and in the U.S. launched similar initiatives.
In 2013, mobile phone carrier NTT Docomo plastered a yellow warning all over a staircase in Tokyo, reading “Walking while using a smartphone is dangerous.”
German city Augsburg experimented with traffic lights embedded in the sidewalks, designed to be easily detected by people looking down at their smartphones.
Utah Valley University, south of Salt Lake City, introduced a designated lane for texting while walking in its gym.
Back in South Korea, the administration said it hopes “the message is made simple and clear, so that the pedestrians who are mostly looking down at their smartphones can easily see it.”

759,Jon Russell,"FarEye, an India-based startup that helps e-commerce companies run their logistics more efficiently, had landed $3.5 million in funding from SAIF Partners.
The New Delhi company operates a software platform that essentially sits between e-commerce firms and their logistics and fulfillment partners. That’s the high-level premise, but FarEye does a lot more than that, so co-founder and CEO Kushal Nahata told TechCrunch in an interview.
“Global logistics is changing now, e-commerce has disrupted the industry and changed things [while] mobile penetration increasing means expectations of consumers have shifted,” Nahata, who started FarEye with Gautam Kumar (COO) and Gaurav Srivastava (CTO) in January 2013, said.
FarEye, which Nahata said has been “profitable since day one,” can help its logistics and commerce customers with warehousing, first mile pickups, on-demand and hyperlocal logistics, last-mile and more. In additional to managing and optimizing delivery fleets — it claims its customers increase their first-time deliver efforts by 22 percent and save 2.3 man hours per staffer per day — FarEye includes analytics that can predict the best locations for a hub, optimal transportation types, and forward-looking business and logistics forecasts.
“We have closely observed the logistics processes, and incorporated features for demand forecasting and capacity planning. Both of them play a major role in planning the workforce and the day to day operations. With end-to-end mobility solution we are helping logistics players streamline the operations and reduce the cash-burn,” Nahata added.

The company makes money by charging a license fee, transaction fees and additionally for vertical-specific services. It claims to serve over 75 customers, including notable names like Ecom express, Gojavas, Holisol, Hitachi, aCommerce, Sephora, and Lazada.
While the company is based in India, with the majority of its 30 staff in Delhi, one-third of its revenue comes from overseas, primarily Southeast Asia, where e-commerce is showing signs of taking off in a major way, and the Middle East. With expansion in mind, FarEye is opening business development offices in Bangalore, Bombay and Singapore as it aims to increase its sales and marketing to land new customers in more varied verticals. It also plans to double its headcount.
The company is also looking to embrace the Internet Of Things and drones to enable automated delivery in India.
Nahata stressed that the company has raised money in order to scale and not because it is running out of capital.
“We have to be a profitable startup,” he said. “I don’t want to build something that goes away in two to three years. We want to exist for 10 or 20 years and be global.”",2016-06-24,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/fareye-1.jpg?w=738,"logistics,ecommerce,e-commerce,india",India’s FarEye lands $3.5M to make e-commerce logistics more efficient
760,Jon Russell,"Is there anything that China’s Xiaomi doesn’t sell? The company best-known for its affordable but high-quality smartphones recently announced its first drone, right after launching a smart rice cooker, and now it has unveiled an electric bicycle.
The Mi QiCYCLE Electric Folding Bike is — as you can guess from the name — also foldable. It comes with a 250W, 36V motor and packs 20 Panasonic lithium-ion batteries — the same type you’d find in a Tesla — alongside Xiaomi’s own battery management system that, the company said, all told will take you 45km on a single charge.
The bike looks like an interesting option for anyone who has an urban commute, and doesn’t fancy an electric skateboard — we’ve seen them in China and the U.S., but not from Xiaomi — or one of Xiaomi’s own electric scooters to cover the last mile/miles home or to the office.
As you’d expect from any Xiaomi product, it is ‘smart’ — which means it has a companion app that displays information about your ride (speed, distance, calories burned, etc), GPS data and the status of the bike. There’s a little more than that. Xiaomi said it has a system — IDbike Torque Measurement Method — that uses sensors to optimize the effort you are putting into pedaling so that you don’t have to overdo it to get to your desired speed.
Like the Mi Drone, the bike will initially be crowdfunded inside Xiaomi’s Mi Home app. That essentially means that the product won’t be fully released until a target number of users have signed up and agreed to buy it first, in a similar to way to how Kickstarter projects have a threshold before they are fully funded.
The initial price Xiaomi is touting is 3,000 RMB, which is around $455, and — as Xiaomi fans will be expecting — the bike is limited to customers in China at this point. This product is part of the company’s new Mi Ecosystem, which is designed to help Xiaomi market products — generally hardware — from partners. Xiaomi has traditionally tapped third parties to provide products that it rebrands and sells via its own channels, including its Mi.com site, but Mi Ecosystem is designed to broaden that program to accommodate more products, just like this bicycle.",2016-06-23,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/mib1.jpg?w=738,"smart-home,china,smart-bike",Xiaomi’s newest gadget is a foldable electric bicycle that costs $450
761,Jon Russell,"Rakuten may be cutting back its e-commerce business in Europe and Southeast Asia, but, at home in Japan, the internet giant is stepping into a new field — quite literally — after it invested in an agriculture tech company for the first.
Weeks after withdrawing e-commerce sites from the UK, Spain and Austria, Rakuten is putting an undisclosed sum into seven-year-old Telefarm, which operates a platform that promotes organic farmers in Japan. Most notably, Telefarm connects consumers with organic farmers and their produce, while it also helps with processes such as storage, transportation, manufacturing, and even the hiring of farm workers.
It’s an interesting move for Rakuten, which is best known for its online shopping empire in Japan, where it has also expanding into financial, a mobile service and more. Rakuten’s presence outside of Japan has been less successful. While it has invested in a range of U.S. companies including Lyft and Pinterest, and it has acquired firms like chat app Viber, video platform Viki, and U.S. coupon site Ebates, the company has withdrawn from less lucrative regions as part of a new strategy.
Organic farming, or organic products, could be a part of that new focus in Japan. Rakuten said that this invest in Telefarm would lead to it launching new products in its domestic market.
Beyond scaling back parts of its global business, Rakuten recently embraced drones — running its first trial on a golf course — and earlier this month it struck an agreement to bring a selection of premium Japanese goods to China via Kaola, the cross-border e-commerce service operated by Chinese internet giant NetEase.",2016-06-23,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/shutterstock_180755009.jpg?w=738,"agriculture,japan,rakuten",Japan’s e-commerce leader Rakuten gets into agriculture tech
762,Natasha Lomas,"How do you compete with China’s homegrown social payments giants? Veteran entrepreneur Jeremy Allaire, co-founder of U.S.-based social payments app Circle, reckons you don’t; not like for like in the domestic Chinese market.
Which is really the sensible view, given that WeChat Pay was already seeing some $50 billion in monthly transaction volume back in March. Meanwhile the older Alipay service was doing some $520 billion annually as far back as 2013. The opportunity to crack into this market as small fry seems sizzled to a non-existent crisp. It’s the Chinese startups who are the pioneers here, not vice versa.
Despite that, Circle is now stepping into China — revealing today it’s set up a separate company, called Circle China, with the aim of serving Chinese consumers.
Also today it’s announcing a $60 million Series D, including from a syndicate of Chinese strategic investors, to fuel growth of its global business as a whole. The round is led by existing investor and Beijing ­based VC IDG Capital Partners, along with Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners and what it dubs “a powerful syndicate of major strategic partners” in China, including Baidu, CICC Alpha, China Everbright, Wanxiang and CreditEase. Also investing in a personal capacity: Sam Palmisano, former chairman and CEO of IBM, and Glenn Hutchins, co­-founder of SilverLake and also a private equity investor.
Circle China has been funded by a separate seed round, of a few million dollars raised some six months ago, albeit with that funding also coming from many of the same investors backing Circle’s global business.
So what’s going on? How is Circle planning to circumvent huge local rivals in China’s personal and social payments space and square a very competitive circle?
East to West
The link is its starting point as a U.S. and now European player, which gives it something it argues that local social payment giants don’t yet have: a foothold in key markets outside China, and therefore the chance to offer Chinese consumers the ability to make payments into international markets.
“There is an opportunity to connect Chinese consumers to the rest of the world and to connect to consumers around the world and to bridge the RMB with the dollar, the Euro, pound sterling,” says Allaire. “As we went in and spent a lot of time in China it became clear that that was a unique opportunity.”
He asserts that Circle’s intention has always been to establish a global business, albeit the startup wet its feet in the Bitcoin wallet space before morphing into what it is now: a p2p payment entity that lets users pay friends via a text message (complete with emoji if they wish) — having taken liberal inspiration from the existing success of just such services in China. (Circle doesn’t really talk about Bitcoin these days, but rather points to underlying blockchain tech as the enabler for its vision of a future of open and interoperable global digital payments.)
But while WeChat Pay, for example, is perfectly positioned to serve the domestic Chinese market given its huge scale there, Tencent’s ambitions are more hamstrung on the international front where its messaging app has not scaled to the vast size achieved in China. So enter Allaire & co, spying an opportunity to tap into the giant Chinese market without having to directly compete with local social payment giants. At least, not yet.
“We don’t have any illusion about competing with the large existing players in China,” Allaire tells TechCrunch. “Alipay, WeChat Pay, as broader platforms have huge penetration. For Circle to try and compete in the domestic social payment market in China would be not smart.
“What we really found was that one of the most challenging things for Chinese consumers is how can they use their RMB around the world, over the Internet? And it’s hard. And how can — if I’m a parent and I have a child studying in Europe or the US — how can I easily share money with them? And it’s cumbersome and costly.”
So specifically it’s this cross-border payments piece that Circle is aiming to tackle in China. And Circle’s investors are impressed enough with this thinking to stump up another large funding round (it last raised a $50 million round in April last year). Although the funding is for the global business as a whole, not specifically for Circle China. (The latter will need to raise more funding off its own in order to launch products, says Allaire.)
“What we bring to the table [in China] is we’ve gone and done all of the ‘heavy lifting’ of becoming a licensed financial institution in the US and in Europe. With the ability to seamlessly and frictionlessly move currency value around in a consumer experience in those markets and if we can connect Chinese consumers to that that can be very powerful,” he says, adding: “It’s a huge need.”
Circle China is therefore a necessary stepping stone in an ‘East to West’ strategy for Circle (although really it’s more fully a circle aspiring to go West to East and back West again). And to facilitate that it has been set up as an independent Chinese company, with local companies as its partners, to meet the regulatory demands of the Chinese government.
“Circle China is an independent company. It’s a Chinese company. Almost all of its investors are Chinese companies and investors — and that’s really important to the Chinese government that we’re building a real asset for China,” notes Allaire.
But of course the staggering size of the local Chinese market remains an attractive opportunity, in and of itself.
“We set [Circle China] up that way because we knew that that was going to be important from a regulatory and government relations perspective. But also because the market is so big there that it’s not inconceivable that in five years that business could be materially larger than the US/European business. It’s not inconceivable that business would list on the Shanghai stock exchange.”
Payments on platforms
That’s the ambition but right now Circle China cannot yet launch any products because it does not yet have the licenses to do so — with Allaire unwilling to put an exact timeframe on any future product launches, saying only that it could be as long as a year out.
But whatever (and whenever) Circle China does launch, the products will not be the same “full stop social payment” product that Circle offers in the US or Europe. It could even, suggests Allaire, exist as a feature inside one of the dominant social payment apps.
“We want to make sure that the user experience is the right user experience for Chinese consumers. So that involves building a different product,” he says. “Chinese consumers expect… that a lot of the things that they use to just be features that they can add within things like WeChat. And so it’s not inconceivable that Circle could be a feature inside WeChat.”
Not inconceivable to Circle but that is assuming Tencent would allow such a thing to happen on its platform. And WeChat blocking third party services on strategic grounds is not unusual so it remains to be seen how that strategy (if applied) would play out.
WeChat’s owner Tencent could also try a similar strategy to Circle by setting up its own payments operation in the West (although it would also need to secure regulatory approvals). Or by acquiring a U.S. rival like PayPal — as has been rumored — to get a foot in Western markets that way.
Either way, Circle is banking on being in the driving seat for this approach, pushing first and fast to get all the necessary international links in place. Its US rival Venmo, for instance, remains US only for now. And while various local European p2p players exist, like France’s Cookies, they remain just that for now: local.
“I don’t know what they’re going to do,” adds Allaire of Tencent when I suggest they could try the reverse of Circle’s strategy. “They absolutely could look at these markets. But we haven’t seen any indication of that to date.”
One of Circle’s strategic partners in China — Baidu — does already have a digital wallet product in the market, though usage of this is dwarfed by usage of WeChat Pay and Alipay. Which presumably gives Baidu an incentive to strategically align with Circle, although Allaire says he can’t comment on specific commercial aspects of any of Circle’s investment relationships.
“Certainly there’s an interesting opportunity for Circle with Baidu,” he says carefully. “They’re very interested in blockchain, they’re very interested in these cross-border use cases. And hopefully Circle can do something significant with them.”
Banking on blockchain
Allaire will say one thing: that it’s the first time “major” companies in the various categories that make up the roster of Circle’s strategic Chinese investors — namely investment bank CICC Alpha, commercial bank China Everbright, FS services company Wanxiang and p2p lending platform CreditEase — have invested in the digital currency space, dubbing this “significant”.
“It underscores how this market — blockchain-powered applications — is becoming important globally but it’s also becoming quite topical in China as well,” he adds. “Indirectly the bet we’ve made as a company is that open protocols for value exchange are going to connect every currency and every digital wallet and every merchant service in the world, over time. So we’re betting on an open Internet model.
“All of the existing players, whether it’s Venmo in the US or WeChat Pay in China or anything else, they’re all closed networks, they’re all built on their own proprietary, centralized closed models. That works to a certain point but it doesn’t unlock the kind of vision of money working the way the Internet works — which is open and interoperable — so we’re taking a more open approach than other players in the market.
“But we hope that they all embrace this too. It’s not interesting if just one or two companies use open protocols; it’s interesting if the whole world does.”
Circle’s desire to drive interoperability for digital payments is understandable, given its reality of being later to market with its p2p product than some very big rivals. But of course its ambition for openness will not necessarily be shared by larger competitors which are minting money now via their own closed networks. Their incentives (and power) to block may be greater than their need to unlock — at least in the short term.
The short term reality for Circle, then, is swimming in a pond with some very large sharks. So it will be interesting to see how its strategy plays out.
It’s not breaking out any user numbers at this (still) early stage, a year after launching its US beta, but will only say it’s grown its transaction volume on a dollar basis by “more than 300 per cent”. And is “on pace” to do well over a billion dollars in transaction volume this year. Its customer base has also grown at a similar rate (300 per cent), according to Allaire.
Circle also only rolled into Europe this April, making its first international expansion moves by partnering with a UK bank to support pounds sterling as its second fiat currency after the dollar, and opening up a feeless cross-border payments offering between the two currencies. It’s not breaking out any metrics for Europe yet either.
Today it’s announcing that its first Euro-using European market will be Spain — where’s it hoping to launch shortly. Allaire says it’s aiming to be live in all 28 European Union Member States by the end of this year, so it’s clearly driving hard and fast to get all the pieces in place for a US-Europe-China p2p payments play.
“Lighting up Euro on Circle’s platform is critical in our effort to enable consumers everywhere to share value, and is also important to our efforts in China,” note Circle’s two co-founders in a blog post today. “Between the US, Europe and China, there are 2+ billion consumers who will share value, and we want to enable that experience in the same way that these consumers share messages and content today.”
Allaire says Circle has customers in around 100 countries at this point, using Bitcoin to join the dots and settle payments where it does not yet have local banking partners. Although he notes that 70 per cent of its users are in the US, UK or Europe — i.e. where it does have boots and banking partners on the ground to support settling into fiat.
And with the seeding of its Far East outpost Circle is clearly hoping to be able to add China to that list of major markets in the not too distant future.",2016-06-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/p1040511.jpg?w=738,"wechat-pay,jeremy-allaire,circle,social-payments","Circle takes $60M to grow its social payments biz globally, as it steps into China"
763,Jon Russell,"It’s a busy day at SoftBank HQ in Tokyo today. Fresh from confirming the much-anticipated sale of a majority stake in games giant Supercell, SoftBank also announced the somewhat surprise departure of President and COO Nikesh Arora, the man who had been primed to take the top spot from SoftBank Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son.
Former Google executive Arora — who spoke at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco last year — came under pressure earlier this year when a group of anonymous shareholders criticized him for being overpaid and underperforming in a letter to management.
Despite that challenge, Arora’s position seemed to be safe. Yesterday, SoftBank published the findings of a review that found the claims against him to be “without merit.” Despite that vote of confidence, India-born Arora — who is one of the highest paid executives on the planet with a reported annual salary of $73 million — has resigned from his position at the telecom giant.
In a brief statement, SoftBank suggested that a disagreement over the timing of his accession to CEO is the reason for his departure:
Arora is largely credited with leading SoftBank’s investment spree in India, where it put money into Ola, Snapdeal, OYO Rooms and others, and startup deals in the U.S.. It remains to be seen how SoftBank’s investment strategy will look without him leading things.
These are new times for SoftBank. In addition to offloading its shares in Supercell for a price of around $8.6 billion, it has cashed out most of its holding in GungHo, another game maker, and it is selling $7.9 billion in Alibaba shares, its first trade of that stock ever. The deals are part of Son’s vision for “SoftBank 2.0”, and much of the capital is expected to go towards paying off SoftBank’s debt, which went as high as 11.9 trillion yen ($107 billion) at the end of March thanks to expenses associated with its U.S. mobile business Sprint.
This is a very different approach to the last couple of years since Arora, who bought $483 million in SoftBank shares as part of a “personal bet” on the company, joined its ranks. Arora himself confirmed further information, primarily than Son intended to retain the CEO for longer than (it seems) was originally agreed.",2016-06-21,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/screen-shot-2015-09-22-at-9-37-37-am.png?w=738,"japan,nikesh-arora,softbank","Nikesh Arora, the man tipped to become SoftBank’s next CEO, resigns from the firm"
764,Sarah Perez,"Cuff, the smart jewelry maker that promised a line of fashion wearables capable of sending emergency alerts to trusted family and friends, shut down earlier this year leaving a number of customer orders unfilled and vendors unpaid. Now, the company is being named in a bankruptcy suit filed by five of its manufacturing partners.
In one case, the manufacturer Volume & Tone, LLC produced over 100,000 pieces of jewelry in order to fulfill Cuff’s customer orders, but was never paid. They alone were owed $65,000 for their work, which included sourcing and delivery of the product, but other vendors are owed in the hundreds of thousands, according to court filings.
Cuff founder Deepa Sood first met jewelry designer Lane Tabb, one of the vendors named in the lawsuit, through an accessories project Sood was working on for Restoration Hardware, where she was before starting Cuff.
Tabb’s background in brand management, creative direction, design, development and manufacturing has seen her working for brands like Kate Spade, Donna Karan, DKNY, Rebecca Minkoff, BCBG, and Herve Leger – work that made her consultancy Lane Tabb Accessories Group (owned by Volume & Tone LLC) a good candidate to partner with when it came to producing the jewelry for Cuff.

The Cuff device was meant to consist of a small, Bluetooth-connected component called “CuffLinc” that could be placed inside a varied line of attractive jewelry, like bracelets and necklaces, as well as keychains. When the Cuff was squeezed, anyone in the wearer’s pre-configured network would be alerted and sent the location of the Cuff owner. An app would also be offered.
Tabb created samples (non-working costume pieces) for Cuff in 2013 which the startup then used in a video shown to investors. Although asked to rush the sampling, the pitch worked: Cuff was able to raise seed funding in September 2013.
Sood again reached out to Tabb in September 2014, the jewelry designer says, to tell her she had pre-sold hundreds of orders, had done press, and was ready for production. The designer explained that Cuff was not production-ready.
“I reminded her that the pieces we had originally made for her video were just costume pieces — they didn’t have any connector for a chip, due to the chip not yet existing when we made them,” Tabb tells me. “I explained we could get her ready for production with proper sampling rounds once we had the actual removable chip, and real specs designed with the clipping mechanism perfected.”

But Cuff had committed to delivering the pieces to customers by mid-November 2014. Despite the rushed timeline, Tabb took on the challenge, and suggested that some pieces be produced locally in order to speed up the process, as others were made in China at the same time.
As the process began in 2014, Sood did press, attended events and sat on panels at conferences. In November 2014, Cuff was dubbed the most beautiful new wearable at Decoded Fashion’s competition. There were no production pieces at this time, however – just props.
Soon, the hype around Cuff paid off. In January 2015, the company announced $5 million in Series A funding in a round led by NEA along with seed investor Tandem Capital along with Tugboat Ventures.
The first pieces made in the U.S. – around 5,000 items – were shipped out February through April 2015, Tabb recalls. Cuff customers were informed about their pre-order delays via email. Many customers had pre-ordered the jewelry as far back as 2014 when it was first announced.
Above: Cuff customer emails
One email sent in spring 2015 offered customers the ability to cancel their orders and receive a refund. Some customers were able to receive that refund. Others held off on getting their money back and instead chose to wait for the final product to ship.
In summer 2015, another round of emails was unleashed, apologizing for the continued delay and again offering refunds. But the email also included a status update on the project, and made the case for continuing to support the startup.
“It’s been a journey for our small team and we have weathered things like electronic components coming in flawed and shipments of other essential parts being delayed,” wrote Cuff’s founder, sounding very much like the typical startup underdog.
However, the parts were “delayed” because Cuff had gone through three rounds of false-start production, says Tabb, who was directly involved with the production process. Cuff scrambled to figure out details that should have been decided before selling the jewelry – things like which base metal should be used, for example.
“Each time they hired a new internal employee, the new person would come in and change something. Even when the order was almost through production,” says Tabb. “So we would have to throw away all of those pieces and start over. We have never worked with a company that changed their minds on details in the end stages of production,” she laments.
Pieces from China shipped in August 2015 with the final shipment in October 2015.

Above: A Cuff Groupon; Some of the devices were sold online through Kohl’s, Target and Groupon.
In October 2015, Cuff emailed unfulfilled customers with a promise that a new batch of devices was shipping that month or the next, and offered the option of choosing to receive the original device plus a 15 percent refund along with other incentives. These included a $15 credit for a jewelry box that wouldn’t ship until later, a free piece of jewelry, and a coupon for 20 percent off a future order.
The other option presented was to wait until April 2016 and take delivery on a new Cuff device that would include fitness tracking.
After the final shipment in October, Cuff asked Tabb for a few days to pay their final invoice. The startup had always paid on time over the two years of working together, says Tabb, so she wasn’t concerned. She paid her factory partners out of her own pocket, and waited.
In mid-October 2015, Cuff went dark. Tabb says the startup stopped responding to texts, phone calls and emails sent to the accounting department, the CFO/COO (Nandita Bhargava, the sister of Tandem partner Sunil Bhargava), Sood, and all the other VCs, requesting payment.
In December, Sood responded via email and a Tandem investor phoned to say that Cuff was out of business, and the firm was taking possession of the remaining assets.
Cuff had taken on an additional loan of $1.6 million from Tandem in 2015, which gave them an additional board seat. Tandem, controlling the board, decided to acquire assets through a secondary company called Bijoux Corp, created on the same day that Tandem moved to auction off Cuff assets. Bijoux was the only bidder at the auction.
Customers start a “Scammed by Cuff” page
Tabb wasn’t the only one left in the lurch. Customers who didn’t receive their items contacted their banks to file fraud reports, and many had trouble getting a refund because of the delay between the order time and the report.
As one customer we spoke with complained, “because the order past the 130-days mark, Wells Fargo said there was nothing they could do about it. There are so many of us that have had the same problem. We paid a bunch of money for something we never saw and where is [founder Deepa Sood]?”
Others, including the person who started the “Scammed by Cuff” Facebook page, had better luck getting their banks to refund them.
She said Bank of America made an exception because Cuff emails promised the product was still shipping.

Since this spring, the “Scammed” Facebook page has been encouraging visitors to spread the word and file claims with the FTC and BBB; it’s sharing tips on how to get your bank to assist you. Members are also trying to find an attorney to take on their complaints as a class-action lawsuit.

Tabb, meanwhile, soon found she wasn’t the only vendor stiffed.
“I started getting phone calls from other vendors,” she says. “Cuff had used my company as a credit reference with these other vendors so they knew about us, and called us when they also hadn’t heard anything themselves, and were trying to get paid. We are actually owed the least of all the other vendors in the suit,” she notes.
Cuff had outsourced much of its business, it turns out. Other vendors had handled the app development, the engineering, the circuitry, the module casing and manufacturing, and the packaging/co-packaging. Another was making all the displays for Cuff’s Target launch.
REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF ORDER FOR RELIEF BY DEFAULT
Tabb’s firm, Volume & Tone, LLC, is owed $65,344.94. But other vendors were due much more.
According to a petition filed in California’s bankruptcy court, Sigma Connectivity is owed $549,714; Stephen Gould Corp. is owed $258,995.32; DUCO Technologies is owed $213,366.66; and Colony, Inc. is owed $104,872.38.
The lawyers had advised the vendors to force Cuff into involuntary bankruptcy. This would require them to open their books so a court-appointed third party could investigate if there was any wrongdoing or misappropriation of funds.
“We want to get paid for our work,” another vendor, Ola Möllerström, head of sales and marketing at Sigma Connectivity, told TechCrunch, as to why it joined the suit. “We were surprised that Cuff stopped their business and we have asked a law firm to support us.”
Other vendors never responded to repeated requests for comment.
REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF ORDER FOR RELIEF BY DEFAULT
As a small business owner, the impact on Tabb has been heavy – Cuff took so much time that she couldn’t take on other clients.
“It’s been very difficult. but we are getting through it. Unlike Cuff, our base running costs and overhead are reasonably managed, so that when things like this happen you don’t go totally under,” she says. “We are a company that is resourceful, skilled and capable, rather than so many companies now that are just smoke and mirrors – that is becoming more and more prevalent these days,” she continues.
“It’s unfortunate that investors are rewarding this kind of irresponsibility with large capital infusions on startups that have no actual results to show…I have no problem with companies investing in an idea, but not to this extent,” Tabb adds.
 
Seemingly putting more of the blame for Cuff’s failure on the investors, Cuff founder Deepa Sood had this to say about the suit:
“Right before Thanksgiving of 2015, Tandem decided to stop payment on the loan for reasons that are in dispute. I put in $200,000 of my own money to buy the company some time and keep employees — we had just started shipping first product and had orders from Target and Amazon, as well as our direct consumers that we had been working around the clock to fulfill. During this time, the intention was for the Board to figure out alternative fundraising options. Instead of that happening, Tandem, as the loan owner, moved to auction off CUFF assets,” she says.
“After CUFF was shuttered, Tandem, as two-thirds of the Board, took control of all communications between customers, vendors, etc. I did not (nor do I now) have any access to email, contacts, website etc. nor was I involved in outreach to vendors, if any,” adds Sood.
Reached for comment, Tandem co-founding partner Doug Renert offered the following statement on the Cuff lawsuit:

765,Lora Kolodny,"Although self-driving vehicles feel like a near future reality, people still need driver’s licenses to get around independently in cars today.
Now, an Austin, Texas startup called Aceable has raised $4 million in Series A funding to deliver driver’s education in a mobile app. Silverton Partners and Floodgate Ventures co-led the round.
Aceable’s app alleviates the need for drivers (or would-be drivers) to attend courses in person and on someone else’s schedule. Once they take a driver’s ed course via Aceable, users typically have to go take a final driving and written test at their local Department of Motor Vehicles.
Floodgate founding partner Mike Maples Jr. said his firm appreciated Aceable’s focused approach to education and invested in the Series A because the startup has executed well on its initial plans. Floodgate also backed edtech companies Chegg and Clever.
“Aceable has shown early signs of being a ‘capitalist mutation.’ Other companies have tended to pick ed-tech segments that are obvious and crowded…When you think about it in hindsight, it’s obvious:  If you want to drive, you have to take drivers’ ed and this applies at all times, not just during high school and college,” Maples said.
Not all states accept digital education for licensure. But many do, and Aceable is already operational with local, regulatory approvals in: Texas, Florida, California, Ohio and Illinois.
The company will be expanding to Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Indiana over the next year. Additionally, Aceable plans to use its funding to develop curriculum beyond driver’s ed, said CEO and founder Blake Garrett.
That makes sense, in part because younger generations are not as likely to get driver’s licenses as their elders. Blame it on everything from ridesharing to hoverboards. But one University of Michigan study found that just 24.5% of 16 year olds had a driver’s license in 2014, a drop from 46.2% in 1983.
Luckily for Aceable’s long-term prospects, an estimated 25% of jobs in the U.S. require certifications of some kind. Examples include real estate agents, nurses, personal fitness trainers and bartenders.
The company is evaluating nascent industry segments too, Garrett said.
For example, commercial drone operators in the U.S. have to pass an aeronautical knowledge test and register their unmanned aerial vehicles with the FAA. And owners and operators of marijuana dispensaries require different training and certifications depending on state laws.

766,Haje Jan Kamps,"After a smash-hit success crowdfunding campaign last year, Podo is back to do it all over again with the sequel to its Cruel Intentions-inspired camera. Turning any surface into an impromptu tripod with its sticky-backed superpowers, the $49 Podo already zoomed past its $50,000 crowdfunding goal on Kickstarter.
Last year’s campaign had the company selling its diminutive cameras at a cool hundred bob. Now, Podo comes a-knocking with an even better deal: Better connectivity, better sensors, better lens, and half the price. Yowzers!
The camera shoots 5MP photos — nothing to set the world on fire, but more than enough for sharing on social media. It also happily whirrs along filming 720p video at 30fps. The cam comes with a built-in battery rechargeable via USB, 8GB worth of memory. In short, the camera goes a long way towards making photography fun again for people who know they want some flexibility beyond what their smartphones can offer them.
The micro-adhesive sticky pad attaches by squishing it into a wall, tree, or fence — and when you’re done with it, giving it a rinse restores it to its original, super-sticky condition so it can be reused again and again.

“Podo offers freedom and control at the same time. Control is a selfie; freedom is a tripod and timer,” says the company’s president Eddie Lee, pinpointing the product’s USP. “It’s hard to get both.”",2016-09-23,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-23-at-9-32-48-am.png?w=738,"camera,podo",Podo’s $50 Bluetooth camera makes smartphone photography fun again
767,John Mannes,"Airbnb formally filed a Form D with the Securities and Exchange Commission this afternoon announcing that it had raised $555,462,180 in an equity deal.
Last month, TechCrunch independently verified that Airbnb had filed a 28-page document with the State of Delaware indicating that it had intentions to raise additional late-stage capital. At the time, Equidate speculated that the company was attempting to close an $850 million round. The Form D filed today comes in under that value. However, according to sources close to the company, Airbnb has not yet closed the round. The company has the capacity to increase the ceiling to the original $850 million figure. It is relatively common for companies to file with the SEC preemptively with flexibility remaining for final deal terms to change in the near future.
It remains unclear at this point whether the valuation of the company remains the $30 billion speculated alongside the $850 million round. If so, it could signal a change in the price of the round. A more concrete valuation will be more realistic once the deal formally closes. If the valuation is accurate, Airbnb would move up one place on the Unicorn Leaderboard to become the fourth most valuable private startup.
A laundry list of investors have taken part in Airbnb rounds to date. This includes a $1.5 billion Series E the company closed last year. The company was valued at $25.5 billion at the time of that round. In the months after, it took a notable billion-dollar credit faculty.
Multiple strategic investors are taking part in this deal, also according to our source. Airbnb is not believed to be in need of capital, but the eight-year-old company could be beginning to feel the pressure of employees unable to cash in on common stock and early-stage investors who likely could use liquidity on their highly profitable investment in the unicorn. Regardless of a rumored $200 million stock buyback program, the additional capital will support growth and take pressure off the company to IPO.
In terms of strategic investors, the WSJ notes that Google Capital and Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV) are leading the deal. This wasn’t denied by our source close to the company. Representatives from Google Capital and TCV are not expected to join the board of directors of Airbnb. Both of these investors are new to the company and tend to focus on growth-stage rounds.
All of this comes amidst a never-ending stream of regulatory challenges for the company. Not only is Airbnb currently embroiled in a legal battle with the City of San Francisco, it is facing new European pressure this week as the city council of Barcelona is asking residents to report illegal rentals. While Airbnb may not be choked for cash, a lack of global consensus around regulating long-term rentals does not provide a smooth runway for the aging unicorn to IPO.
We will continue to update this post as we obtain additional information.",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-520507254.jpg?w=738,"economy,vacation-rental,business,software",Airbnb files $555M round with the SEC led by Google Capital and TCV
768,Matthew Lynley,"Instacart COO Ravi Gupta will say that a bad day working in the on-demand economy can be plenty demoralizing even if offset by good well-paid days, and Instacart is going to be making some changes in order to even things out.
Today, the company said it is removing its tipping option in favor of raising guaranteed delivery rates for its shoppers. Instead of shoppers relying on something around $5 per delivery plus tips, shoppers will now probably make somewhere around $10-12 per delivery, Gupta said, though the final value will depend on the market. The goal of the change, Gupta says, is to smooth out the earnings curve for shoppers and make it less reliant on spikes in tips.
“Our current structure has shoppers being really reliant on tips for earnings,” Gupta said. “It could work better for our shoppers. The reason is, 20% of our customers don’t tip. That’s a really tough experience of or shoppers.”
In addition, to continue smoothing out that earnings curve, Instacart is going to start estimating the future earnings of shoppers based on the amount of time they are expected to work. That information is based on their previous delivery history among other factors. That change is geared toward giving shoppers a better way to plan out their weeks in order to make the money that they are looking to make.
In lieu of tipping, but still looking to continue rewarding the company’s best shoppers, the top 20% of the highest-rated shoppers will be receiving a $100 bonus at the end of the week. Adding a level of competitiveness might end up making things more demoralizing or difficult for shoppers, but Gupta said that because shoppers are working independently of each other, it isn’t something that they expect to have an impact on shopper behavior.

All these changes appear to be attempting to do two things: keeping shoppers — especially the best ones — working on Instacart, and trying to streamline the delivery process by encouraging shoppers to do more deliveries and get a guaranteed rate. By doing that, Instacart can not only pull back on its needs to acquire new shoppers, but encourage shoppers to try to end up driving more revenue to Instacart. But in cases where shoppers, say savvy ones that know which neighborhoods tip the best or perform better, that are accustomed to large tips might end up in a situation where they end up less. (That’s where the bonus comes in, largely.)
“What we’ve heard from shoppers is the low moments hurt more than the high moments are good,” Gupta said. “The moments of doing delivery and not getting a tip, it hurts more. I don’t think we feel like overall every shopper is gonna make more money by this approach. What we say with confidence is there’s dramatically more consistency and for every delivery I know I’m gonna make a fair amount.”
The on-demand economy can be seen as a punishing environment with difficult unit economics and high overhead. Instacart is one of the prime examples of an on-demand company, one of the earliest and looking to essentially remake the grocery shopping experience. But instead of just focusing on taking a share of the delivery in addition to grocery store partnerships, the company is looking to start attracting advertising revenue from consumer packaged goods companies.
All this can start driving the cost to the customers further down, and convince them to continue buying things through Instacart. If they can effectively drive that cost to zero, it could make Instacart much more attractive to potential customers and build up a habit within them. CEO Apoorva Mehta laid out the plans at TechCrunch Disrupt SF earlier this month. There, Mehta said he believed the company to being cash-flow positive in the next year.
“We have partnerships with hundreds of retailers who also do a revenue share with us, but we also have CPG companies such as Pepsi, Proctor & Gamble, who promote their products on Instacart,” Mehta said. “As a result of that we have a third source of revenue most people forget about. The key point here is that all on-demand companies do not look the same.”
Still, all of this at the end of the day is to give shoppers more confidence in working with Instacart and continue driving the company forward. There’s a common perception that Instacart is in a tough position (many Silicon Valley watchers will echo the refrain that they are in rough shape), but if it continues to scale, that allows it to better convince new partners, gather more data for its advertising business, and eventually prove to its investors that it can be a strong sustainable business.",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/disrupt_sf16_apoorva_mehta-4077.jpg?w=738,on-demand,"Instacart raises guaranteed delivery payout rates, removing tipping option"
769,Kristen Hall-Geisler,"AutoMobility LA, the new name for the press days before the public LA Auto Show in November, has announced the ten startups competing for visibility and mentoring opportunities. The board that chooses the finalists includes executives from companies small and large, new and old: Lyft, Google, NVIDIA, Local Motors, and General Electric, among others.
The startups that made the list cover a wide range of automotive technologies, from cybersecurity to ride hailing to service apps. There are no automakers like Elio Motors this year, but there is one company that is building foldable scooters for last-mile commuting.
Here are the top ten:
All of these companies will be exhibiting at AutoMobility LA in the Technology Pavilion. The LA Auto Show has had a Connected Car Expo for the past few years, but this is a pivot toward the future of transportation that puts more emphasis on technology, cleaner fuels, and shared ownership. It seems that the LA Auto Show is setting itself up for a time when auto shows as we know them will be obsolete.
It’s also likely its organizers feel CES breathing down their necks. In 2016, there were more than 100 automotive tech companies at CES, and nine automotive manufacturers with huge auto-show-style displays and press events. Detroit is feeling the pressure too. The North American International Auto Show, which butts up against CES on the calendar in January, has a new AutoMobili-D space to showcase autonomous and connected vehicles as well as Mobility as a Service (MaaS).
Back to AutoMobility and these top ten startups. Three of these companies will be mentored on stage at the event by investor Bill Tai, and from those three, an ultimate winner will be announced.

770,Elmira Bayrasli,"

After trying and failing to get their startup Udemy, an online education platform, off the ground in their native Turkey, Eren Bali and Oktay Cağlar headed to the United States in 2009. Both knew that in the U.S., specifically Silicon Valley, they could gain the support and traction that Udemy needed. Yet Udemy was not enough to gain them entry into the country: The United States does not have a visa specifically for entrepreneurs eager to launch businesses.
Instead, Bali and Cağlar applied for jobs with tech firms that sponsored them for H-1B visas. Both worked at SpeedDate, an online dating platform, during the day, while working on Udemy after hours. Yet it was when Bali and Cağlar were ready to leave SpeedDate, having raised funds to formally make a go of  Udemy in 2010, that they got stuck. Leaving SpeedDate meant giving up their respective H-1B visa status. Bali and Cağlar applied for an H-1B through Udemy. Bali’s was accepted; Cağlar’s was rejected. Bali could stay in the U.S. Cağlar had no choice but to return to Turkey until a new H-1B was approved.
“It was a difficult arrangement,” Bali told me. Still he and Cağlar made it work. To date, Udemy has raised $173 million and employs around 250 people. Its platform is used worldwide and poised for further growth.
Immigrants have played an important role in boosting America’s economy. They have founded iconic companies such as Proctor & Gamble, Kraft, AT&T and, more recently, eBay, Facebook, Google and SpaceX. More than one-third of 2015’s Fortune 500 companies are connected to an immigrant entrepreneur. Twenty-five percent of the U.S.-based startups valued at a billion dollars or more, popularly referred to as “unicorns,” have an immigrant behind them. Together, these companies are worth $70.9 billion.
It is time to re-evaluate the U.S. immigration system — to create more opportunities for entrepreneurs abroad to come to America for the specific purpose of starting a business. Specifically, Congress needs to pass a permanent visa for immigrant entrepreneurs.
On August 26, President Obama made good on a long-awaited promise: The White House announced plans for a new International Entrepreneur Rule that would allow some immigrant entrepreneurs to work legally in the United States for up to five years. Originally promised in his executive actions on immigration from November 2014, the proposed rule marks an important step forward in maximizing the economic potential of immigrant entrepreneurs in the United States.
However, the rule has limitations — chiefly, it could be changed or revoked under a new White House administration in 2017.  It falls to Congress to build permanent channels — visas — for immigrant entrepreneurs after failing to do so for years.
Since 2010, Congress has been presented with several draft “Startup Visa” bills. None have been debated or put to a vote. Politics has gotten in the way.
The “startup visa” has fallen victim to the larger discussion about immigration and, particularly, the larger question of security. Indeed, the U.S. determines who may or may not enter the country on criteria that prioritizes security — whether the applicant is perceived as a threat or not — over skill and any potential economic value-add.
Other countries recognize the importance of immigration to economic growth. Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Ireland, Singapore and the United Kingdom all have startup or entrepreneurship visas that encourage individuals eager to set up a business to immigrate to their respective countries.
And why wouldn’t they? Immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as their native-born peers. In a 2007 study, AnnaLee Saxenian, the dean of the University of California at Berkeley’s School of Information, and entrepreneur and author Vivek Wadhwa found that more than half of Silicon Valley startups had one or more immigrants as a key founder. According to Inc., in 2012, immigrant-founded engineering and technology companies in the U.S. employed 560,000 and generated $6.3 billion in sales.
Across the United States, local governments have begun developing their own initiatives to reach out to entrepreneurs. Massachusetts launched the Global Entrepreneurship in Residence program, which allows entrepreneurs to build businesses while maintaining employment at local universities. Michigan aims to keep more of its international science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students with a Global Talent Retention Initiative. Cities such as Cleveland, St. Louis and Detroit have programs to help immigrant entrepreneurs cut through red tape.
But within the context of national immigration policy this is not enough. States do not determine immigration policy. Only Congress can legislate permanent solutions for immigrant entrepreneurs. While Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has indicated that his chamber won’t take up the issue of immigration reform until 2017, Congress can and should move forward with other legislative proposals that would build both channels for and pipelines of immigrant entrepreneurs.
As I recently argued in a piece I wrote for The Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Congress can (and should):
When talking about the impact of immigrants on the United States, President Lyndon B. Johnson noted, “The land flourished because it was fed from so many sources — because it was nourished by so many cultures and traditions and peoples.”
Entrepreneurship and immigrants have been a critical part of the American economy and prosperity. It is vital that we continue to find ways to welcome them.",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-487133726.jpg?w=738,"udemy,immigration-reform,immigration,h-1b-visa",Making the case for a startup visa 
771,Megan Rose Dickey,"Taxi startup Flywheel is officially making its move into New York City, with the aim to better equip old-school taxis to take on Uber and Lyft. Flywheel recently received approval from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission to operate TaxiOS, its smartphone-based taxi meter that comes with electronic dispatch, payments, navigation and GPS-based metering.
Competitors like Arro by Creative Mobile Technologies and Way2Ride by Verifone, which also market themselves as surge-free alternatives to Uber and Lyft, also have their own digital hailing and payment apps.
“This has been the quintessential duopoly,” Bhambani said. “For better part of decade, they have been the only licensees to do this until now. This is what we’re breaking up — this duopoly.”
Back in December, Flywheel received approval to launch its TaxiOS across California after a successful pilot program in San Francisco. Fast forward to today and Flywheel has 400 of the roughly 1,800 taxis in San Francisco using TaxiOS, Flywheel COO Oneal Bhambani told me. In New York, the goal is to replace the old-school taxi meters in over 1,000 cabs by end of this year.
Down the road, Flywheel envisions putting a Samsung tablet in the backseat for passengers to access Wi-Fi hot spots and entertainment, Bhambani said. Flywheel has also been providing last-mile delivery for e-commerce companies for the last two years. Bhambani would not disclose how many companies Flywheel does this for, nor the names of those companies. Though, word on the street is that Amazon is one of those companies.

772,Lora Kolodny,"A company called Flybrix is putting legos on the wing.
The San Francisco startup today began selling build-a-drone kits for kids age 14 and up comprised of: LEGO bricks, boom arms and motors that don’t require soldering, and other off the shelf and Flybrix-designed parts.
Once assembled, Flybrix drones are lightweight and meant to be flown indoors. They can be operated with a Bluetooth flight control app for iOS or Android smartphones, or a manual flight controller purchased from the company.
Flybrix drones are also, notably, “crash-friendly,” meaning they can be re-assembled time and again as kids experiment with their designs, and learn how to pilot them.
Co-founders of the startup, Amir Hirsch, Robb Walters and Holly Kasun, want to get teens, or younger kids with adult supervision, interested in things like geometry, aerodynamics and electrical engineering.
The company was founded in 2015 and has been developing its technology at Lemnos Labs, a foundry for hardware startups in San Francisco.
Flybrix is selling the drones direct to consumers via its own website for an introductory price of $149 for a basic kit, and $189 for a deluxe kit. Orders taken now will ship immediately to customers, just in time for the start of the school year and well ahead of the holidays.

The basic kit includes about 40 pieces and instructions needed to build a small quadcopter. Assembly takes under fifteen minutes. Deluxe kits include more complex models and ideas and games that require kids to modify a basic design, and figure out how to make their own drones.
Flybrix’s Chief Play Officer Holly Kasun said the company isn’t officially partnering with LEGO, but has made its business known to LEGO and hopes that teens who use LEGO bricks to build drones will also try the massive toy company’s other STEM-related products, such as their LEGO Mindstorms kits.
Kasun also noted that LEGO bricks– because they’re so consistently manufactured and widely available– are used not just to inspire kids and get them building. They have long been used by mechanical and robotics engineers in labs for prototyping and design.
Flybrix cofounder Amir Hirsch attained 3 degrees in math and electrical engineering from MIT where he used LEGO products in the lab, which inspired the eventual creation of Flybrix, Kasun said.",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/flybrix_lifestyle.jpg?w=738,"hardware,stem-toys,education-tech",Kids can build a LEGO drone with Flybrix kits
773,Haje Jan Kamps,"When was the last time you printed a photo? Well, Fotr is a new iPhone app that wants to turn that trend on its head, by automatically printing every photo you take. The idea is to bring back an aspect of analog photography: shoot fewer, but higher-quality photos.
Photo printing is far from dead. At Photokina, I saw a new camera from Polaroid with a printer built in. Leica launched its Sofort, a fancy Instax camera. A propos Instax, fashion designer Michael Kors got involved with a special edition of the instant-print camera aimed at the fashionista crowd. And I finally had a chance to play with the Impossible Project’s I-1, an interesting new take on the instant-print camera segment.
Fotr mimics the behavior of these instant-print images by printing your photos for you, whether you want them or not.
“Today people take near-infinite numbers of photos. They end up stored on a hard drives and nobody has enough time to go through all of them. We wanted to make them tangible,” Ondrej Loudil, Fotr’s founder explains. “You can forget about the tons of unseen photos with Fotr: the app will print all the pictures you take. No exceptions.”
Once you’ve captured an image using the Fotr app, the images are printed and shipped to you within 10 days.
“Many professional photographers recommend getting an analogue camera to improve your photography skills,” says Ondrej. “Film is expensive, so it makes you think before you take a picture.”
The company claims that hidden in the restriction of having to pay for every print, is a creative liberation.

So, is it a good idea? Hard to say; there’s definitely something to be said for only printing photos that are any good, and you can get prints made at a lower cost than Fotr. As someone who’s spent countless hours in a darkroom developing and printing photos, I think the theory behind the app is sound. Being forced to be more aware of your photography can do wonders for a user’s photographic output. I doubt a lot of users will make Fotr their main photography app, but maybe it’s worth to spend (up to) $35 on getting your creative juices flowing.",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/fotr-prints-03.jpg?w=738,"photokina-2016,photo-printing",Fotr forces you to print every iPhone photo you take
774,Lora Kolodny,"Signia Venture Partners has closed its second fund at $85 million to lead early-stage deals in emerging tech startups mostly in and around San Francisco.
For the unfamiliar, Signia is typically the first money in and the lead investor in the companies it backs, writing $1-2 million in seed stage deals or $2-8 million in later stage rounds.
The firm was started in 2012 by Rick Thompson, the founder of Playdom Inc., a social games developer acquired by Disney for a reported $763 million in 2010. Other founding members at Signia include game and adtech industry veterans Ed Cluss, Sunny Dhillon, and Zaw Thet, who are all investment partners in Signia Fund II.
Thet said that Signia partners have been especially interested in artificial intelligence, computer vision, education tech, and new business models or technologies that will give rise to the next generation of media companies, and other apps that take advantage of augmented- and virtual-reality.
Signia’s portfolio has most famously included Cruise Automation, the self-driving vehicle tech startup which sold to GM in a blockbuster deal valued at more than $1 billion.
And Signia invested early in: the VR software company 8i that turns videos into hyper realistic 3-D images; Eonite Perception, which makes depth-sensing technology used in virtual reality headsets; Super Evil Megacorp, creators of Vainglory, the mobile game; and the bulk, e-commerce marketplace Boxed.
As is typical in venture capital, Signia’s first fund included its cofounders’ own money, and money from family offices, high net worth individuals and strategic backers, in this case, in media and entertainment.
Its second fund includes institutional investors, Thet confirmed. While he did not have permission to name Signia’s new limited partners, the investor said they ranged from large endowments that focus on children’s education, to tech conglomerates.
According to Thet, Signia’s investing partners (including himself) retained major stakes in Signia Fund II, which they believe align the firm’s interest with those of limited partners and portfolio company founders.
As to why the firm remains focused on seed through Series A stage deals, and Silicon Valley, Thet said:
“Valuations are not as heady as they were even a year ago. And it’s getting easier to find and retain talent. But at the same time, traditional Sandhill Road shops have moved away from these deals because their funds have gotten bigger.”
Signia partners aim to work in a very hands-on way with the companies they back, and as such, the firm only does about 8 deals a year, Thet said. That’s the same pace they plan moving forward, despite the larger fund.
The firm shared more about their investment philosophy in a company blog post here.
Thet suggested that founders pitching the firm should demonstrate more than a good net promoter score or growth in active users.
“A lot of entrepreneurs will talk about the features of a product they built and metrics… But we also need to know why now, what’s the opportunity to create a really amazing company that couldn’t exist before,” Thet said. “Long-range vision matters.”",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/signia_venture_partners.jpg?w=738,"rick-thompson,zaw-thet,signia-venture-partners,venture-capital",Signia Venture Partners has $85 million in new funds to invest
775,Jordan Crook,"Scale Model, the betaworks-backed marketing platform for better audience targeting, has today announced the launch of its fully-baked V2.
Scale Model hooks into the Twitter Ads API to help brands and influencers better understand their audience, and the way that their own follower community, or sub-communities, interact with one another.
Upon the initial launch, Scale Model was building out community models for brands manually, which could take up to 48 hours, depending on the complexity. Today, however, the company is launching a fully self-serve product, where individuals and brands alike can not only track and understand their audience, but run flexible campaigns around that data.
For example, the San Francisco Giants’ audience is comprised of many sub-communities. While almost all of them share a broader interest in baseball (which is reflected in their tweets, bios, RTs, favorites, etc.), they also break apart into smaller sub-communities, such as Giants fans, coaches, amateur players, SF natives, etc.
With the help of Scale Model, the Giants social team can instantly look at its audience segments and better understand how they overlap. They could see, for instance, that “hot dogs” is a keyword across the majority of their sub-communities, and use that as part of a marketing campaign for one of their games.
By making the platform self-serve, with clearly indicated pricing tiers, Scale Model is now able to consider other platforms to conquer. Twitter is but a slice of the pie when it comes to social media marketing, and Scale Model has the technology to empower brands and influencers across a number of platforms.
For now, Scale Model is only available for Twitter, but I wouldn’t expect that to remain true for much longer.

776,Fitz Tepper,"For some reason certain people feel the need to create a dating profile using someone else’s pictures. Whether it’s done to impersonate someone else, bully someone or even just pull a prank, it happens more than you’d think.
Luckily Bumble thinks they have found a pretty innovative way to stop it from happening, at least on their platform. The female-led dating app just announced that they are launching photo verification as a way to rid impersonators from the platform.
Here’s how the verification process will work. Bumble will randomly show you one of 100 different  poses – like  someone taking a selfie while winking at the camera or holding up two fingers, etc. You then take a picture of yourself mimicking this pose to the company, and they make sure it matches up with the person in your profile pictures.
These pictures will be reviewed by a team of real people working in-house, and even though it sounds like a big workload the startup says they have the capacity to verify  people “within minutes”.

While Verification won’t be mandatory for all users, anyone who has had their profile reported as being potentially fake will have to verify within 7 days of being reported. If they don’t verify in this time period their profile will be hidden and they will be temporarily denied access to seeing matches.
And even if you’re not flagged you can still apply to be verified manually just to let potential suitors know you are who you say (or show) you are.
All verified users, both those who opt in to be verified and those that are prompted to will receive a special verified badge on their profile similar to Twitter or Instagram.
While Bumble is using photos there are of course other ways for companies to verify users – some use cell phone numbers to make sure your name matches your profile and others  make you upload a picture your driver’s license. But Bumble’s method seems pretty straightforward and accurate – since the pose you need to mimic is chosen from a database of 100 pictures the odds of an impersonator finding a photo where their target is doing that exact same post is essentially zero.
Verification will roll out in about a week, starting with users who have been reported as being potentially fake. Then about two weeks later Bumble will open verification to all users.",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-526295977.jpg?w=738,"bullying,abuse,dating",Bumble will soon let users get verified in an effort to squash impersonators
777,Josh Constine,"With a little personal shopping assistance, Operator thinks Chinese citizens will pounce on American products sold through its conversational shopping app. The promise of becoming the guided commerce layer connecting China with the US has earned the two-year-old a $15 million series B round at a $100 million pre-money valuation.
“We’re making commerce borderless”, Operator CEO Robin Chan told me.
GGV Capital, which specializes in US-China startups, led the round and its partner Hans Tung will become a board observer. Tung praised Operator’s “mass-market-first approach” and its understanding of “the value of creating a global company from the start” rather than trying to bolt China onto an app built for the US.
Other new investors include Formation8, Morningside Ventures and billionaire Li Ka Shing’s Horizons Ventures. Existing investors Greylock Partners and Expa from Operator’s April $10 million, $40 million pre valuation Series A also participated
Hugo Barra, former Google Android VP and current VP of Xiaomi Global, will join the board to bring his China chops. Operator China will start a logistics and marketing office in Shanghai led by Yolanda Xue, former VP of merchandising at mobile commerce at Wish. They’ll give Operator a home town edge rather than coming in blind from abroad.
Operator’s iOS, Android beta, and Facebook Messenger interfaces let people browse categories of topics like apparel, shoes, cosmetics, gifts, home goods, and electronics. They can get the goods delivered from the closest, cheapest possible source. If needed, users message a chatbot for help, which will connect them with a human expert in that product category who earns a commission on what they sell.
The idea is to fill the gap between ecommerce and brick-and-mortar by combining the convenience of shopping from anywhere with the personalized customer service of being there in person. Though there’s potential for this model in the US, Operator is still trying to find viral growth.

But its new strategy revealed today attacks a ripe market. To get goods from the US, Chinese buyers typically have to risk purchasing fake knock-offs, expensively have someone else shop for them abroad in person, actually travel themselves, or endure a distant ecommerce experience on sites like JD or Alibaba where they might have trouble reading English reviews.
With Operator, Chinese citizens will be able to text chat with a human shopping expert from the US with Chinese language skills. They can show the customer products that fit the price, quality, and style they’re looking for, even if the buyer is unfamiliar with US brands.
Chan says “We’re trying to pioneer a new type of global commerce.” That might sound exciting, but it will be tough work to educate consumers about a totally foreign way to buy things. But Chan is resolute in his belief in “a standalone messaging platform that looks like a commerce platform.” After 20 years of shopping on websites, Operator could bring back a human touch at scale.",2016-09-22,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/operator-china.png?w=680,"conversational-commerce,chatbots,operator","Operator harnesses chatbots, humans, and $15M to sell US goods to China"

For the first time TechCrunch is bringing its CrunchMatch program to Europe where startup founders will be matched with venture capitalists ready to write checks and make investments.
This is CrunchMatch
TechCrunch’s new program to curate meetings between investors and startups is a hit.
At TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016, TechCrunch helped 50 investors and 76 startups make a total of nearly 200 connection meetings at Disrupt. We’re thrilled to announce that CrunchMatch will be coming with us across the pond at Disrupt London 2016.
How it works: When an investor registers for Disrupt, they’ll receive an invitation to fill out a questionnaire about their investment interests. Startups in the Battlefield and those which purchase Startup Alley ticket packages will receive a similar form.
TechCrunch will use those responses to match investors with startups that fit their investment profile and interest areas. We’ll also help coordinate those meetings at a private space and at a time that works for both parties during the course of the Disrupt conference.
CrunchMatch investors at Disrupt NY raved about the experience, with 85% of participating using CrunchMatch to scout future investments, and 93% of investors saying they would participate in CrunchMatch again.
Investor Breakfast
Want to compare notes with other investor at Disrupt? Join us on Monday, 5 December for an Investor Breakfast. This breakfast is a way for TechCrunch to bring together investors who are registered for Disrupt to network with each other and with the TechCrunch team. An invitation to the Investor Breakfast will come in the weeks preceding Disrupt once an investor has registered for a ticket to the conference. The TechCrunch team will make a brief presentation and take questions from attendees.

779,"Josh Constine,Sarah Perez","Facebook today filled the biggest hole in its chatbot platform. Messenger bots can accept payments natively without sending users to an external website, Facebook’s head of Messenger David Marcus announced today onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016.
Finally, the credit card info people already have stored in Facebook or Messenger can be used to instantly make purchases in bots that are part of the new closed beta the developers can apply for. Marcus also revealed that 34,000 devs have joined the platform and built 30,000 bots in the April launch, up from over 10,000 devs in May and 11,000 bots in July.
To support payments in Messenger, Marcus says that the company is working with all the major players in the industry including Stripe, PayPal, Braintree, Visa, MasterCard and American Express — not just Stripe and PayPal which the Facebook developer blog post mentioned.
During the talk, Marcus discussed Messenger’s rise to 1 billion users thanks to a forced migration from Facebook’s main app, his relationship with Mark Zuckerberg, and the early stumbles with chatbots that have been used by millions of people across 200 countries.
In an effort to show Facebook’s commitment to its platform for bots, Marcus announced that all types of News Feed ads can point to them and users can share bots they enjoy with their friends. And instead of forcing all bot interactions to happen through text, developers can now build web views into conversations to pull in interfaces from their websites. This way you could scroll a list of flights, consume different types of media, or even play basic games while still in the chat window.
This is all part of the Messenger platform v1.2 that launched today. “Inside a thread you have identity, transaction capabilities, the ability to draw UI, and draw native buttons and interfaces,” Marcus explained. “We’re bring all these types of experiences together.”
He noted also that the webview could be prefetched to be very fast, which one of many under the hood performance improvements the app has seen in recent months to improve the startup time on mobile, and other latency issues.
All these changes will help to make Facebook Messenger bots better live up to the promise of the platform, which Marcus admitted was perhaps a bit undercooked at launch.
“The problem was it got really overhyped, very, very quickly,” he said. “The basic capabilities we provided at the time weren’t good enough to basically replace traditional app interfaces and experiences,” he said.
Because developers weren’t really given enough time or resources to build their bots before the platform went live, many early adopters felt that bots weren’t significantly better (and sometimes were a lot worse), than their mobile web or mobile app counterparts.
Marcus was asked how far ahead of the bot platform launch Facebook gave developers the final details about what functionality would be offered. He responded, “a couple of weeks only”. When asked if that was enough time to build a high-quality bot, he admitted “probably not”.
“It’s not easy,” said Marcus of rolling out a platform like Messenger’s bots. “It takes time. What we wanted to do at F8 is enable all the over 34,000 devs on the platform, whether they’re building capabilities for third-parties or actual experiences,” he said.
While some bots – like those focused on delivering news – have done well, others have needed a lot of work to offering a compelling experience.
 
But with the addition of webview and payments, something like Hipmunk’s forthcoming travel bot can do things like help travelers find and book airline tickets and hotels, as well as show itineraries right in the Messenger app.
Along with the addition of the new capabilities, developers will also now be given more guidance from Facebook on how to build successful Messenger experiences, Marcus noted.",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/disrupt_sf16-2841.jpg?w=738,"chatbots,facebook-messenger","Facebook Messenger now allows payments in its 30,000 chat bots"
780,Ingrid Lunden,"As LinkedIn continues to wait for the close of its $26.2 billion acquisition by Microsoft, it continues to build out its business, with the latest developments on the international front. Last week, LinkedIn announced that it had hit 100 million users in Asia Pacific (around one-quarter of its total), and today at an event in Bengaluru, India, it unveiled three new products it’s rolling out in India, where it has 37 million users, that it hopes will now get them (and others) using the site more.
LinkedIn Lite is a new pared-down mobile version of LinkedIn that is designed to work on lower-end handsets and those that are accessing the site with limited or very expensive mobile data services. It will be rolling out in the next couple of weeks, a spokesperson tells me.
Meanwhile, the company has also launched a service called LinkedIn Placements to provide an online test for users and help place them in jobs. And for businesses, it’s launched LinkedIn Starter Pack to set up and run their profiles on the social platform.
LinkedIn Lite. Today at the event in Delhi, CEO Jeff Weiner said that LinkedIn Lite would be rolling out to users in the country in the next few months. As with other “lite” versions made for mobile, LinkedIn’s service does away with things like extra graphics and rich media to download four times faster than LinkedIn’s basic mobile site. The company claims the homepage only takes up 150 KB of data, and further pages 70 KB.
From the looks of the screenshots here, it appears the Lite version may simply be turned on by default in situations where bandwidth might be tight: as you can see the URL is LinkedIn’s basic linkedin.com.
LinkedIn Lite is a late entrant into a market that has seen a number of other attempts to grow usage numbers in India by meeting their mobile data demands: while the vast majority of people in India (which is the world’s second largest smartphone market after China) use mobile phones rather than PCs to access the internet, more generally data is very expensive for the average user, and connectivity is not as fast.
Facebook has been offering pared-down versions of its own social network for years now aimed at developing markets. They include Facebook Lite, an Android app launched in 2015. And Zero, a text-only version introduced in 2010. Controversially, it’s also worked with carriers to launch free versions of its site, too, under the Basics brand: many complained, however, that the service violated net neutrality rules and it eventually got shut down in India. Twitter has also worked on ways of developing its own lighter versions and specific services for markets like India.
LinkedIn Placements. While Lite is designed to get people using LinkedIn more on a daily basis, Placements is a service aimed at making LinkedIn more practical and useful for them.
Here, LinkedIn has partnered with HackerRank, as well as Aspiring Minds, Co-cubes and Wheebox, to develop an online test for users to show off their skills and interests, which are then matched up with a number of jobs being advertised on the site. You then proceed with the usual job finding process that involves interviews, references and more. There are some 50 jobs already up for Placements through the scheme in areas like software development, marketing and finance. (The emphasis initially seems to be software: HackerRank, which powers the first test, specialises in engineering and programming skills tests.)

Placements is an interesting development that touches several parts of LinkedIn’s bigger business strategy. The company has been moving very aggressively into online education services, spearheaded perhaps most obviously with its acquisition of Lynda.com, and this is an interesting development that ties in another way of using the online testing format to help boost another part of LinkedIn’s business.
That other part, of course, is recruitment advertising, which today is the company’s biggest revenue driver. Right now, while LinkedIn is spreading the word about the Placement service to would-be jobseekers, it’s also encouraging businesses to place their ads on the platform to match up those people with positions.
In a market that may have a lot of self-taught programmers and others, it provides one way of trying to circumvent the normal course of students graduating from a particular university, or otherwise be overlooked in the job market. This also potentially gives LinkedIn a more central place in how it believes its platform can influence what Weiner has described as the “economic graph” of our society.
The other area where Placements will help LinkedIn’s bigger business is in getting more users to give it more information. Part of the scheme involves updating and filling out your own profile on the site before you take the online test, which will give LinkedIn a new opportunity to pick up fresh and accurate data about you.
Starter Pack. The last of these is less obvious for consumer users but is an interesting compendium to how LinkedIn hopes to grow its profile as a directory for businesses online, and potentially develop those relationships, too. The promise for the companies that build profiles on LinkedIn’s platform is that they can market themselves better: “Grow your Brand. Grow your Team. Grow your Influence,” is how LinkedIn describes it. More practically, it will give LinkedIn an avenue to court these companies for more recruitment and other ads; and perhaps down the line, after the deal with Microsoft closes, it will give it an avenue to sell more Microsoft products to them, too.
“India is a vital market for LinkedIn, as we work towards realising our vision of creating economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce,” said Akshay Kothari, Country Manager and Head of Product, LinkedIn India, in a statement. Kothari joined LinkedIn when the company acquired Pulse, the newsreading app he co-founded. “It’s already one of the world’s most important economies, and continues to experience strong GDP growth. While LinkedIn has grown multiple folds in India since we started operating here 6 years ago, there’s so much more we want to do here. We are committed to India and to boosting our ability to deliver value to even more members and be a part of their professional growth journey, by investing and innovating locally.”",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/linkedin-india.jpg?w=738,,"LinkedIn courts users in India with LinkedIn Lite, online job placement tests, business tools"
781,Peter Yared,"

Application development has long been fraught with peril: Projects become bloated, expensive and never ship. Implementation technologies tend to match the bloat, ranging from Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to Business Process Management (BPM). As Redpoint’s Tomasz Tunguz recently pointed out, growth in Software-as-a-Service is slowing, and a next generation of applications will weave new workflows across existing applications in novel ways.
The “micro” trend in application development is focused on delivering bottoms-up, simple solutions to complex problems. Micro services can easily integrate multiple systems, micro apps can present them as easy-to-consume user interfaces and micro flows allow users to simply complete tasks across systems. This “micro wave” triad of services, apps and flows offers a new way to weave existing systems in novel, organic ways in order to deliver solutions immediately.
Micro services

Interoperability between apps has long been the holy grail of application development. Heavyweight, top-down architectures such as CORBA/IIOP in the 1990s evolved into SOA in the 2000s. Implementing a SOA required enterprise-wide mandates and coordination. Payload standards such as SOAP are heavyweight and fraught with incompatibilities, especially at the authentication layer.
A few companies such as GE have had the discipline to implement a SOA, but for most enterprises, SOA projects have failed to gain widespread adoption. Even after success, the constant divestitures and acquisitions of the corporate world keep SOAs a moving target.
Over the past few years, micro services have become vogue. Micro services are atomic, self-contained services that perform a single operation on a back-end system, such as a retrieving a customer record. The most common interface to a micro service is the well-known and very straightforward JSON/REST/HTTPS paradigm. Authentication is also straightforward and is typically easy-to-use API keys.
The beauty of micro services is that they are incredibly easy to create, deploy and share. New and existing applications can easily call numerous external and internal micro services. Naysayers correctly point out the micro services can too easily propagate like mushrooms, fail to scale and are hard to share and discover. However, these are problems that should be corralled by policy within an enterprise, rather than heavy-handed technology.
Making it easy for apps to organically communicate with each other has spawned a new generation of app creation and delivery that has made it far easier for both enterprises and software vendors to accelerate a new generation of applications.
Micro apps

Since the introduction of iOS and Android app stores in 2008, mobile apps have taken over as many consumers’ primary interface to computing. With the plethora of apps available, it is so difficult to attract consumers to install an app on their device and keep using it. It is therefore very common for vendors to pile a bunch of features into their apps so they can retain existing users with new functionality, as well as attract more users. As a result, native apps are becoming increasingly bloated and hard to navigate.
A new wave of “micro apps” is emerging that are intelligent and context-aware. Platforms supporting micro apps range from interactive Slack and Facebook Messenger bots to Google’s interactive answer boxes, such as weather and flights. These micro apps are typically single purpose and use a combination of straightforward user interfaces and context.
Facebook Messenger’s micro apps are composed of rich bubbles and menus
Micro apps are based on HTML and load dynamically, typically bypassing app stores and loading directly into existing communication tools like Slack and Facebook Messenger. There is definitely pushback to the natural language aspect of “bots.” However, the ability to quickly load interactive micro apps directly into messengers and even search results is quickly gaining traction. Facebook Messenger, in particular, is quickly integrating new features, such as dynamic menus and interactive units, which can do anything, from helping you buy a shirt to ordering a pizza.
Slack’s director of developer relations, Amit Shevat, sums up micro apps very well: “they must do one thing really well.”
Micro flows     
       
Business Process Management (BPM) tools help organizations implement top-down automation of business processes. They are typically very expensive and take a long time to deploy. BPM tools manage long-lived workflows requiring a combination of human interaction and machine-to-machine transfers.
The first foray into micro flows were by companies like IFTTT and Zapier, which move data from one machine to another — for example, moving a Salesforce closed deal to Zendesk. While these services are popular, they have hit an upper bound in traction and revenue. New companies such as Workato are extending machine-to-machine workflows between SaaS systems, but they are very similar in complexity to BPM solutions, with a domain-specific language suited for programmers.

A micro flow in Slack
The new potential for micro flows is in the arena of human-to-machine interaction. Now that messenger platforms like Slack and Skype provide rich, interactive HTML that lets users interact with back-end systems, there is an opportunity to reinvent how users interact with enterprise software.
With micro flows, users can bypass complex and unwieldy legacy systems to perform simple actions, such as approvals. One of the biggest complaints of modern workers, particularly younger workers, is the difficulty interacting with legacy IT systems that have not been upgraded in years. Much like Generation X workers wondering why there were so many typewriters around, millennials are perplexed by the unnecessarily complicated and antiquated systems at most Global 2000 companies.
Even executives and managers can benefit from micro flows for the multitude of approvals that generally require logging into systems they only occasionally use. Many companies have multiple systems for functions such as expenses. Although IT may have a long-term plan to consolidate systems, micro flows allow executives to interact easily with multiple systems through a single interface.
Because micro flows typically require some type of interaction with a user, they can leverage notification features in mobile devices and messengers. Such simple, easy-to-use micro flows make it easy to fully integrate contributors into a more macro workflow.
The combination of micro services, micro apps and micro flows build on each other to deliver a new paradigm for delivering the next generation of apps. Hopefully we can learn from the lessons of the past and not try to “grow up” the micro revolution.",2016-09-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/micro-apps.png?w=738,"bots,app-developers,micro-services",Why app development is going micro

Their solution? TheHighFlyers.club. This clever Disrupt hackathon hack lets you see when you’re passing cool stuff outside of the plane and even chat with other people on the flight. There is also a Watson-based chatbot that lets you ask questions about your trip and destination.
The hackathon project is live now and isn’t quite ready for prime time, but the team plans on building it out this month and launching a finished version.
“We wanted to change a problem everybody has when they travel,” said Fegley. “When you travel by yourself it’s boring.”
They knew that creating a Slack room for the air probably wouldn’t be enough. So they added features.

783,Matthew Lynley,"There’s plenty of information online to help people figure out whether their plants are healthy and what they need to do to make them better. But they can be distributed far across the Internet and sometimes hard to find, and aren’t necessarily available on demand, according to Martín Capeletto.
That’s why the team, a bunch of plant nuts (though they wouldn’t tell us exactly WHICH plants), decided to build Plantbot. You take or upload a photo of a plant, and using some machine learning tools available online, it’ll tell you whether or not your plant is healthy and what might be wrong with it. The process takes a few seconds, and then if users have additional questions, they can query them a chat interface in the app. The company demoed the app at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2017 Hackathon.
“We are working on services usually, but we do want to launch products between the company, and every time the Hackathon is an opportunity to do that,” Capeletto said. “Folks all over the internet are full of questions about the plants, and I love gardening, love the forums, the questions are always the same.”
There are a couple common problems that the app can diagnose — for example, a differently colored leaf might signal that there’s not enough nitrogen in the soil, and brown tips on the leaves may mean there are too many nutrients in the soil, Capeletto said. This handles the issue of quickly answering questions that most plant owners might have.

The team feeds in photos themselves with some common problems, and then matches it against the photos that are coming in, so there will be some hurdles to getting enough data online and encompassing the wide array of problems. But it should be possible to dig through all the information that’s available online, along with accompanying photos, to build a big enough lexicon to get a good handle of most problems for plants and solutions. And they often require simple fixes, Capeletto said
The team behind Plantbot — an international group consisting of Capeletto, Hernan Berroja Albiz, Agustín Capeletto, and Iago Rodríguez López — aren’t strangers to Hackathons. In fact, this is their sixth hack from TechCrunch Disrupt’s Hackathons. Last time around, the team built an app that would crawl through reviews to surface whether or not you’d like something at a venue or restaurant (like whether a restaurant has good tacos, for example).
This isn’t entirely a new idea, and the concept of diagnosing plant health with a camera has been around for a while. In 2013, a project called Infragram sought to do the same thing with a camera. But smartphone cameras are improving, and so is image recognition and comparing technology. If the team can keep up with putting together enough data — or maybe figure out a way to do it algorithmically — it could end up being something pretty useful for plant owners around the world.

784,Josh Constine,"Here come the fashbots, and this time they might actually be useful.
Facebook’s seemingly half-baked chatbot platform soured many on the potential of conversation user interfaces. The first bots built by outside developers back in April were clumsy and more trouble than just using a website. So Facebook’s Creative Shop is getting involved, working with bot creator Msg.ai and the Tommy Hilfiger fashion brand to make a flagship chatbot worthy to point to.
The TMY.GRL A.I. Messenger Bot will promote today’s debut of Tommy’s capsule fashion line for supermodel and social media star Gigi Hadid. People can discover it by tapping the message button on Tommy’s Facebook page or posts, opening a shortlink URL or scanning its Messenger QR code.

Through the bot, fashionistas can type questions or select pre-made queries to learn about Gigi, see behind-the-scenes content from the collection’s runway show event and, most importantly, shop for items from the nautical-themed clothing line.
Facebook still hasn’t built a native checkout and payment flow into its Messenger bot platform. Shoppers will be linked out to Tommy Hilfiger’s website to put in their credit card details and confirm purchases. While that might give brands a deeper sense of control over the experience, it likely also reduces conversion rates as leaving Messenger gives them a chance to get distracted or reconsider buying something. It’s something Facebook will hopefully build soon.

I asked why the company is diving into the unproven world of bots, Tommy Hilfiger himself told me “We’re really focused on going directly to the consumer. We are obviously distributed in our own stores and in department stores, but going directly to the consumer is really part of the motive and the future of the omni-channel process.”
Puneet Mehta, CEO of Msg.ai, explains that consumer goods companies are attracted to bots because of “the relationship aspect, not just sales.” If they can create a memorable, interactive experience with their brand instead of just one-way marketing, customers will keep coming back. That’s why Facebook’s marketing experts from its Creative Shop, which typically help out advertisers, got their hands dirty on developing this bot.
How did a 31-year-old company come up with the idea for a chatbot? Hilfiger tells me it started with “a conversation I had with Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook. We talked about innovative ways to enhance the shopping experience. We’re always a bit ahead of the curve.”

Chasing new technologies hasn’t always panned out. While Tommy Hilfiger’s Instagram and Snapchat strategies have been a success, 25 years ago it unsuccessfully tried to build touch-screen vending machines. Hilfiger explains that “We had lots of trials and tribulations with that. The credit card system was working, the touch-screen heated up.”
But now he feels that by relying on a dependable company like Facebook, there’s less to worry about and more to gain as customers embrace new ways to shop.
Tommy Hilfiger CMO Avery Baker tells me that “one of the things that’s always been important in fashion is customer service and the experience in a store.” The TMY.GRL A.I. Messenger Bot will try to answer people’s questions and offer a more immersive, responsive feel than shoppers usually get online.
The bot will try to capture some of the personality of talking to Gigi herself, while remaining transparent that there’s not a human on the other end. “No one wants to feel like they’re being spoken to by the corporate animal,” Baker admits.
Fashion still seems like an unlikely candidate for chatbot success. People can’t touch or try on the clothes, and the bot doesn’t know enough about the user’s style to make smart recommendations about which items they might prefer.
But Hilfiger believes this brand-specific bot could perform better than multi-brand retail shopping bots like Spring, which launched with the Messenger bot platform and was quickly proven confusing and unconvincing.
“I think if you’re an established brand and the consumer is familiar with the brand, they have confidence that that certain cotton or cashmere or denim is the quality that would be acceptable, that they would be confident that the fit would be okay,” Hilfiger concludes. “There’s a lot of different reasons why people shop online. Now they can receive shipments, try on items, and send back what they don’t accept. They don’t necessarily need to touch and feel.”
At the very least, Tommy Hilfiger could use the campaign to lure people into messaging their bot first. That’s critical, since Facebook Messenger only lets brands message people who’ve already pinged them. Getting conversations started is essentially the new version of getting people to Like your Facebook Page. Better to build an audience early than get left behind.",2016-09-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/tommy-hilfiger-bot1.jpg?w=680,"chatbots,facebook-messenger",Facebook steps in to prove the value of chatbots with Tommy Hilfiger
785,Sarah Perez,"Facebook Moments, the company’s private photo-sharing application which took the place of mobile photo sync late last year, is now expanding beyond the confines of your mobile phone and your personal network. While previously, the app allowed you to share your photos with select Facebook friends, the new version allows you to share a web link to your private album with anyone – even those you’re not connected with on the social network. They can then join the album, and proceed to add their own photos.
This makes Moments more useful at larger events where not everyone may be connected on Facebook, such as baby showers, weddings, parties, and more.
To access the new feature, you can either pull up one of your existing moments (aka albums) or create a new one, then click on the three dots at the bottom-right of the screen. Here, you’ll see the new options to “Share Link” which gives you a URL you can send over email, messaging, or through any other means you prefer.

This web support follows a move by Google Photos earlier this spring which added improvements to shared albums – notably, the ability for users to add their own photos to a shared album they received from a friend, as well as support for commenting. Facebook Moments, meanwhile, was still limited to private photo-sharing among Facebook friends at the time.
The upgraded Moments application is rolling out another new feature, as well: support for full-resolution photos. While the app already will host all your photos for free, it wasn’t a true photo backup service as it would optimize those photos for mobile use.

That changes a bit with the addition of a new “Favorites” tab in Moments. When you add a photo to your Favorites by clicking the star at the top-right corner within 30 days of uploading them or receiving them, it will then be saved in Moments in full resolution. There’s no limit on the number of photos you can favorite either, notes Facebook.
This again, seems a direct response to Google Photos, which launched with free, unlimited photo storage plus the option to choose a different plan where you can save full-res photos to your Google Storage. The difference is that Google Photos requires you to pay for the additional storage you need beyond the 15 GB it offers for free, which is also shared across Google Drive and Gmail.
Facebook, instead, is requiring you pick-and-choose which photos deserve to be saved in full-res – likely knowing that the manual labor involved with starring each photo will cut down on people uploading entire albums at the original resolution. Of course, Moments is still not an alternative to a full photo backup service, but it could be a cheaper option than Google Photos if you’re one of those people who is already close to maxing out your free storage, due to heavy Gmail or Google Drive use.
The updated app is live on the iTunes App Store and Google Play.",2016-09-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/moments-fav-full-res-2screens.png?w=738,"mobile,photos,facebook-moments","Facebook photo-sharing app Moments expands to web, adds support for full-res photos"
786,Matthew Lynley,"Managing the App Store can be one of the most difficult experiences for new developers. Getting noticed is hard, the experience isn’t that great, and now Apple is allowing search ads. And to make things more interesting, there’s a lot of interest in different platforms beyond traditional apps — including messaging bots.
Eventually, there will have to be a way to seamlessly develop applications that can thread across multiple platforms like messenger bots and, theoretically, more suped-up web browser experiences. That’s what Ernestine Fu, a part-time partner at Alsop Louie partners, is hoping to get done with a new company called Blackstorm. The company said today that it has raised $33.5 million from investors like Rakuten, Highland Capital, executives at Oculus, and a number of other angel investors, as well as Alsop Louie.
“If you think about the market right now, everyones using apps right now, all apps are built on iOS and Android, and the distribution is controlled by Apple and Google. Giant companies like Uber and Lyft have been entirely built entirely on these app stores. If you think about whats next, where are we actually going to have new distribution platforms, that can exist in the form of one messenger, apps within app environments, IoT, mobile browsers, the goal of this company is powering the infrastructure to trade and distribute software to all the post app-store platforms.”

Now, it would seem, the race is on for Messenger applications. Case in point, Apple is opening up its iMessage service to third-party developers (as well as a whole lot of other things), and Facebook and Slack are aggressively trying to attract developers to build bots and other services within the platform. A lot of this is playing catch-up to the experience originally created and popularized by WeChat in China, Fu said, and is long overdue.
“Every time there’s a new platform that’s created, there’s new problems,” Fu said. “There’s two in particular that stand out, the first one is it’s hard for developers to embrace new tools and technology. The second aspect in the beginning it’s also very inefficient to distribute to users. And at the end of the life cycle it gets really inefficient in that only the Triple-A top tier content with millions in marketing will have a big audience. I think traditionally platform shifts have endured these pains over many years and evolved to have a mutual balance, but now there’s an explosion of computing platforms.”
Right now, Blackstorm consists of two products: what Fu is calling the Neo Store, and a development environment that can spread across multiple different types of user experiences like messengers. The former is a white-label service for companies like telecom providers to deliver additional content beyond using just an App Store using web portals, Fu said. The latter, for now, includes an IDE, but the aim there is to just make it easy for developers to publish across multiple platforms regardless of the experience.
But with the emergence of new platforms comes the race to develop for it, get there first, and stick a flag in it in order to attract early adopters. Of course, silly apps will be there, but developers will eventually create use cases that piggyback and work really well on messengers, and they’ll eventually be starting with just one (probably Facebook, the biggest one). They’re going to need to find ways to branch out to new platforms as they emerge, as well as existing ones, and that’s something that Blackstorm hopes to facilitate.
It’s also going to require a shift in user behavior. Normally we interface with a bunch of squares on our screen that we download from the App Store. There’s certainly a lot of drop-off from between someone linking an app through a messenger to downloading the app, and inevitably setting up an account. The square grid on your phone probably isn’t going away — you can already save web applications to the screen, for example — but the whole experience of sharing and playing around with apps is likely shifting to suit whatever environment you exist in at the moment you want to interact with it.
Apple has taken a lot of effort to level the playing field for the App Store. It recently began efforts to remove abandoned apps and fight spammy app names. All this is aimed to make the App Store experience more palatable, but it’s hard to say if that will be successful. Developers are going to follow the audience and a more seamless development experience may end up also attracting early adopters.
Fu thinks that Blackstorm will one day be able to replace the App Store. That’s pretty aggressive and for the foreseeable future, seems really unlikely. But that’s not to say that it can’t co-exist with the App Store for the time being — and, who knows what the future holds as user behavior shifts. WeChat is a prime example of a ton of usage existing within a different application beyond just an App Store. Other new platforms, like VR and various connected devices, are also still in their infancy and it’s not clear if they will become widely used.",2016-09-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_3742.jpg?w=738,"bots,app-store",Blackstorm raises $33.5M to help developers get their apps everywhere beyond the App Store
787,John Mannes,"Whether you’re working out of a dorm room or running a billion-dollar company, a little pivot can go a long way. At their worst, pivots can derail a company’s success, but at their best, they demonstrate a company is still attuned to its user base — no matter how big it gets.
Digit, a fintech service that helps people save, launched a year and a half ago with the hypothesis that the key to incentivizing savings was simplicity. The company dropped a nifty SMS tool to proactively inform users of their spending habits and nudge people to save. While it’s true that simplicity is important, it turned out that people didn’t feel very in control of their money over a platform as colloquial as text messaging.
To address this problem, Digit launched an iOS application that rapidly grew to account for half of all users. Today, the company is taking the next step by launching an Android version of their service as well. As we previously covered, Digit connects to your checking account and analyzes personal cashflow to optimize savings.
When we spoke with Digit CEO Ethan Bloch, he said he expects the number of users accessing Digit through their mobile app to grow to 90 percent in the coming months. The premise is an interesting one with a number of fintech services taking sides between in-app and out-of-app offerings.
Mobile payments company Boku for example raised $13.75 million in funding last week to facilitate transactions for digital goods and services outside of an application. Users input their mobile phone number to pay for goods directly. People are comfortable processing “hundreds of millions of transactions” on the platform, but Digit has been discovering that all of that changes when the transaction moves from spending to saving.
Bloch gives an explanation rooted in behavioral science to explain why his Digit savings service works better through a mobile application. Bloch noticed that engagement was double in the mobile application. He explained this data point by saying that users want to feel their money is cordoned off and protected. Fundamentally there is nothing different in how money is managed on an SMS service or one run through a mobile app. However, an app provides the illusion of separateness, a private place users can check their balance. And while it may seem silly, small details like this matter in the real world.
The shift seems to be working as the company has grown to manage $30 million in savings every month, up from the $20 million we reported back in June. The 19 person company is projecting $360 million per year in facilitated savings.
Interestingly, the iPhone user demographic is wealthier than that of Android, so the new application will make it easier for everyday Americans to use Digit to manage their cashflow.
“Android gives us a more normal distribution of the working population, and a better sense of the economic fate of the country, including more people who have trouble making ends meet each month,” said Bloch
In the coming months, Digit will be focusing its financial resources on developing new features in their product roadmap. The company has raised over $36 million in funding from GV, General Catalyst, Ribbit Capital, and Baseline.
The new app is available from the Google Play store starting today for Android 4.1.2 and higher. Even with the new app, customers can continue to receive financial updates via SMS if they so choose.",2016-09-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-08-at-9-33-01-am.png?w=738,"fintech,digit,sms","Digit, a simple app to help you save, launches Android app"
788,Sarah Perez,"Pokémon Go has achieved a number of records since its debut – the most downloaded app in its first week ever and the fastest to reach 50 million installs on Google Play, for example – but now you can add one more to the list: the fastest mobile game to reach $500 million in revenue. According to a new report from App Annie, Pokémon Go has now surpassed $500 million in worldwide customer spending across iOS and Android, and is on track to hit a billion in revenue by year-end.
The game reached the new milestone in just over 60 days, App Annie says.

The news follows Niantic Labs’ announcement at yesterday’s Apple iPhone 7 event that the game had been downloaded over 500 million times worldwide since its debut, and trainers had walked over 4.6 billion kilometers while playing. It’s now arriving on the Apple Watch, and also likely played a huge role in Apple’s related announcement that its App Store had seen 106% year-over-year growth over the course of the last two months alone.
App Annie had previously reported in early August that Pokémon Go was on track to exceed $350 million in revenue to date, since its early July debut.
Only a short time later, and it has blown past that figure and then some.
For comparison’s sake, other top mobile games have taken much longer than a couple of months to hit the $500 million metric. Candy Crush Saga took over 200 days and Clash of Clans and Puzzle & Dragons took over 400 days to rake in that much money.
The report also pointed out that in-app revenue alone is not Pokémon Go’s only source of income The company is beginning to partner with brands for in-app exposure, too. For example, McDonald’s in Japan became the first sponsored location for the game, turning the restaurant’s 3,000 stores in the country into Pokémon Go gyms.
This month, Niantic announced a partnership with mobile operator SoftBank that will see the company’s 3,700 stores turned into Pokémon Go gyms or Pokéstops.

Meanwhile, Pokémon Go is still retaining its users, App Annie says. Though its 30-day retention rate has now slipped behind Words with Friends, it’s still ahead of Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, and Candy Crush Saga.
The firm also noted that the game still doesn’t seem to be stealing time from other apps, but is instead claiming more of users’ “non-mobile time.”

789,Josh Constine,"In just 30 seconds, you can enjoyably consume a viral video or a few Facebook stories. But until now, the shortest thing you could typically listen to was a three minute song, especially when you factor in the time to get your headphones untangled, on, and playing. Hearing anything shorter was more trouble than it was worth.
Yet with wireless earbuds going mainstream thanks to the unveiling of Apple’s AirPods, we’re poised to see an explosion of shorter audio content consumption and creation.

First, it will become much easier to consume short snippets of audio during the in-between moments of life, similar to how we consume visual content today. Waiting in line at the coffee shop, during pauses between public interactions, or whenever we have a spare couple seconds, many of us reach for our phones. We pop open our favorite apps like Twitter or Imgur, and relax with a few scrolls or swipes.
Wireless earbuds unlock this behavior for audio. Without the wires getting in the way, we’ll be more likely to leave them in our ears so they’re at the ready. We could listen to a page or even just a few lines of an audio book or make a little progress on a podcast whenever the opportunity arises.

Longer-term, wireless earbuds that we still take out could be the bridge towards an (essentially) always-in audio technology. With that future in mind, I believe we’ll see shorter-form audio content start to be purposefully created.
Five-minute YouTube clips seemed brief when they first emerged on desktop, but soon enough, mobile gave rise to six-second clips on Vine and social videos optimized for Facebook that catch your eye in the first three seconds as you scroll by. Perhaps AirPods and their contemporaries will usher in a similar shift in audio creation.
Imagine stand-up comedians boiling routines down to snackable one-liners, or playlists that sequence the best short jokes to fill your wireless buds. Apps designed to read you summaries of news articles would grow more ubiquitous. Authors might divide their works into shorter chapters. We could see more mini-songs like the twenty three-second Beatles track “Her Majesty”.  And asynchronous voice clip messaging might replace some our daily texting.
Down the line, simpler interaction with Siri and other apps through voice commands could emerge as the core value of AirPods. Right now, voice recognition is still a bit spotty. As it improves and we grow to rely on voice interfaces, more interactive short-form audio content could take off. If there’s one company I’d trust to build a device that essentially lives in my ear all the time, it’s Apple.

Until we all shift to wireless, Apple ditching the iPhone’s headphone jack may actually make quick audio consumption tougher for some people as they fiddle with Lightning connector dongles for their old headphones. But once we ditch the cords, we can look forward to a new generation of snappy sonic entertainment whispering in our ears.",2016-09-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/airpods-snack1.png?w=738,,AirPods and the rise of snackable audio
790,Haje Jan Kamps,"Apple continues to dance a sexy dance for photographers all over the world, launching better cameras with more features and higher quality. But when Phil Schiller, VP of marketing at Apple stands on a stage saying that digital zoom is a good thing, real photographers won’t listen to him. Neither should you. Here is why.
The thing that had me jumping up and down on my chair throwing swearwords at my computer was Phil Schiller’s claim that digital zoom was somehow a good thing. It really isn’t. It never has been. It never* will be.
Y’see, the problem is that your photos are limited to the amount of light your camera is able to gather. When you use digital zoom, you’re no longer using the full imaging sensor; instead, you are using fewer and fewer pixels. You usually still get the same number of pixels, which is accomplished by interpolating a lower number of pixels to cover the full image. You don’t have to be a professional photographer to realize that’s not great.

Worst of all — cameras have flaws. There is no way of avoiding that. When you start pixel peeping, those flaws become oh-so-very-painfully obvious.
“But Haje,” you cry in frustration and disappointed rage, “How will I get my subjects bigger in my frame?”
Simple. Zoom with your feet. If you want something to get bigger, walk closer. It’ll do your photography a world of good.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m hella excited about twin cameras. Adding a longer focal-length lens is a brilliant move. It means that you can get up close and personal with your subjects. It’ll make a tremendous difference for smartphone photographers, for sure.
Having two whole different camera assemblies rather than an optical zoom feature is smart, too. Moveable parts in a camera this small means that the manufacturing tolerances have to be ridiculously precise. Moving parts are also susceptible to knocks and bumps and mechanics eventually wear out. So yes; two lenses is smart. In fact, I have no doubt that Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be some of the best cameras available in mobile devices.
But… if you want to make the most of ’em, don’t listen to people spouting marketing bollocks on stage. Shun digital zoom like the bubonic plague and stick to the zooms provided by the cameras. On Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus, that means you should shoot at 1x or 2x zoom, nothing in between and nothing beyond. If you really want to “zoom” your image, you can always crop it later, with much the same effect.
*There is one tiny little super-geeky caveat here: If you are using digital zoom to zoom to somewhere between the two extremes, you could in theory use high-end light-field calculations to get a zoom ratio that is better than the sum of its parts. In that case, the camera could use a cropped version of the wide-angle camera, augment it with data from the other camera and create a composite image that could, in theory, be a happy medium. That’s the route Light’s L16 is going down, after all. There’s no evidence currently that this is the case for Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus, however.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-07-at-11-12-32.png?w=738,"iphone-event-2016,iphone-event","No, Apple, digital zoom still sucks"

792,Matthew Lynley,"The iPhone’s base-level storage — starting at 16GB — has been a sticking point for quite a while. More and more content has become available over time in the form of video, apps and photos, and it can be a big limiting factor forcing users to shell out extra cash in order to skirt those requirements.
Today, fortunately, that era comes to an end. The cheapest version of the iPhone 7 now comes with 32GB of storage rather than the traditional 16GB. This brings the iPhone roughly in line with a lot of the other base-level storage options that competing smartphones have.
This is going to be a big delight for potential iPhone buyers. While streaming has become the most widely-adopted method for watching video or listening to music, it doesn’t remove the need for a lot of storage when apps start requiring more and more space — not to mention storing more photos as the fidelity of those photos and the space required increases over time.

In in the case of Germany, this is Amazon’s first release in a non-English language for its Alexa voice-controlled assistant.
“Millions of customers in the US have already fallen in love with Alexa and we are thrilled that it now speaks German,” said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, in a statement. “We are pleased to bring Echo and Alexa to Germany.”
Amazon Echo is available for pre-order in the UK starting today for £149.99. It will start shipping in the coming weeks, says Amazon. For a couple of days, Prime members in the UK can pick up an Echo for £50 less. The Echo Dot will be available starting next month priced at £49.99. Or for the very enthusiastic, Amazon also will offer a 6-pack, where you buy 5 Echo Dots and get 1 free, or a 12-pack, which gets you 2 free.
In Germany, the Echo will retail for €179.99, and €60 for the Dot.
The e-commerce giant’s latest hardware play has been a surprise hit for the company since first launching at the end of 2014 in the U.S., with people in these markets asking for it right after it launched. Its popularity is part of a larger wave of devices and services launched by large tech companies over the last several years, which include other players like Apple’s Siri on OS devices; Google’s Home and Now efforts; and Microsoft’s Cortana.
Powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning, these aim to help us interact with and use other services much in the way that human assistants could do. While Amazon’s has a clear connection to its own larger e-commerce operation — you can order Amazon products through them, of course — it’s a much larger play by the company to be a platform for helping you run your whole life.
And now Amazon is ramping up scale and investment in expanding the operation. It bullishly projects it will sell 3 million units of the device in 2016, with that ramping up to 10 million in 2017, according to a report in The Information.
“Millions of customers love Alexa, and we’re thrilled to introduce her to the UK and Germany,” said Dave Limp, Senior Vice President, Amazon Devices and Services, in a statement. “We’re also excited to expand the Alexa Skills Kit and the Alexa Voice Service, so developers and hardware makers around the world can create Alexa experiences for UK and German customers.”
The UK and German versions will give you the same range of integration options — you can use it to integrate with thousands of other services by way of “skills” that you teach Alexa, Amazon’s voice-powered assistant.
There are now 3,000 of these in the U.S., Amazon announced yesterday, including entertainment/media services like Spotify and CNN (where you speak to the devices to play music or hear news); connected home services like your smart lights; as well as more basic things like using the device like a time keeper and alarm.
The big differences in the newest launches will be localisation. The U.K. version of Alexa has a British accent and will integrate additionally with some products that are available specifically in the U.K. market like the Hive thermostat, Netatmo, and the food delivery service Just-Eat. Meanwhile, the German version will include integrations that will let you order rides through MyTaxi or make calls and deal with your bills (fun!) with Deutsche Telekom. Perhaps because of the localisation issue, for now, Amazon is touting only “hundreds” of Alexa apps in Europe.

794,Romain Dillet,"Today has been a massive Apple update day. The company released iOS 10, tvOS 10 and also watchOS 3. After announcing it at WWDC, it’s finally here — and it’s a huge update.
I won’t mention all the changes with watchOS 3. Instead, I’ll focus on three topics — speed, app switching and watch face switching.
With watchOS 3, your favorite apps stay in memory so it feels much faster when you launch it. How fast you might ask? Nearly instantaneous, even on the original Apple Watch. And I can confirm that you’ll definitely feel the difference in action.
In addition to this much-needed improvement, Apple has changed the behavior of the side button. Instead of opening up the Friends screen, the side button now lets you switch between your favorite apps in a Dock view. It feels like using the app switcher on iOS, but much faster.
These two modifications have turned me into an Apple Watch app user again. I’ve never stopped wearing my Apple Watch, but the key features have always been reading the time and getting notifications on my wrist.
I found glances not really helpful and the home screen too hard to use — you don’t want to spend 30 seconds digging for an app and launching it. But with the Dock, I’ve set up my favorite apps and I use them quite a lot. It’s easy to open them, they load quickly and they work well for quick interactions.
Finally, changing your watch face was a bit cumbersome with watchOS 2. You had to deep press on your watch, then scroll, then select. Now, you can swipe left and right to switch from one watch face from another.
Instead of using the same watch face every day, I find myself changing it up depending on what I’m wearing, turning the Apple Watch into a versatile fashion accessory. People who like switching bands will like this feature as well.
If you want to download watchOS 3, plug in your Apple Watch, go to the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and install the update.

The Comma One is a $999 add-on shipping before the end of the year, with a $24 monthly subscription for its software, which Hotz says will be able to drive your car from Mountain View to San Francisco without requiring a driver to touch the wheel, the brake or the gas.
This isn’t a kit that makes your car into a fully self-driving vehicle, Hotz is quick to note, but it is a system that can provide powers equivalent to Tesla’s Autopilot, without requiring that you buy a whole new car. “It’s Mountain View to San Francisco without touching the wheel,” Hotz said. At launch, Comma One will support a small group of specific vehicles, but over time the startup hopes to add compatibility with more models.
Hotz contends that Comma’s key ingredient is “shippability,” a key ingredient he says other companies lack. Automakers and other startups are fond of announcing self-driving car projects (another was announced earlier today, in fact), but Hotz points out that many of these companies don’t even have hardware, let alone products they can sell to consumers.
“It is fully functional. It’s about on par with Tesla Autopilot,” Hotz said. It doesn’t have a lot of sensors as the Comma One relies on built-in car front radars and comes with a camera. “The key sensors that we’re getting back is the cam. We’re actually getting back the video, even Tesla isn’t doing that.” Hotz said. “We have all the video data.
The exceptions almost start and end with Tesla, he notes. The company’s Autopilot system is in active use, and in fact just got an update this past weekend that should vastly improve its performance and decrease the possibility that the car doesn’t brake when it should. “If they are the iOS of self-driving cars, we want to be Android,” Hotz said.
Hotz also spent some time talking about Tesla’s fatal crash. “40,000 people die a year from not paying attention. It isn’t like it is a special case ‘a self-driving car killed him’, it was the case of a driver not paying attention,” Hotz said. “It did unfortunately happen with Tesla. And I think Tesla’s response was very appropriate.”
 

Hotz’s system stemmed from critiques of offerings used by many major automakers, like the ones from Mobileye, and the intent of the Comma One is to provide features that automate highway driving to an even greater extent than existing adaptive cruise control and lane assist tech. “If you’re looking to Mobileye to build the software of the future — don’t,” he said during the interview.
The $999 price point is designed to be affordable, and is possible because of the components Comma uses in its product, which tend to be inexpensive off-the-shelf electronics. “We’re going to try our best to ship it before the end of the year. Again, in very limited quantity,” Hotz said. More info about its release and availability will be revealed soon.",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/comma-one.jpg?w=738,,Comma.ai will ship a $999 autonomous driving add-on by the end of this year
796,Romain Dillet,"Melonee Wise of Fetch Robotics gave her insights on robotics and how robots are going to enhance our future. Fetch Robotics specialized in warehouse robots so that humans don’t have to walk around all day long. But even before Fetch Robotics, Wise has been active in the open-source community when it comes to building the software for our robots.
TechCrunch’s Devin Coldewey asked all the hard questions, but Wise remained optimistic about the way people are going to rely on robots. “PR campaigns against robots have an 80-year head start,” she said.
She also acknowledged that governments and companies need to set safety standards to make sure that nothing dramatic is going to happen. In particular, car companies will have to deal with self-driving car incidents.
“Some countries are coming up with more formalized testing. We need to have more serious validations against those algorithms,” Wise said. “It only takes one mistake to kill someone. Of course you’re technically going to save more lives in the long run, but do you want to be the engineer responsible for one death?”
But in many fields, robots are simply going to enhance our productivity. In fact, according to Wise, the question is quite simple. “If I could give you mechanical devices with software that would do all the crappy tasks for you, would you take it?” she said.
Let’s take Fetch Robotics as an example. Warehouses are semi-structured environment and can already be quite efficient for warehouses. “On average, we’re running 30 kilometers a day per robot,” Wise said. “We’re driving more than people walk, I can tell you that.”
In particular, Fetch Robotics can map millions of square feet, an order of magnitude more than the default open source stack. But the hardest part might be convincing people that they’re capable of giving orders to robots. It all comes down to building simple interfaces.
“The hard stuff is enabling people who know nothing about computers or robots,” Wise said.
Finally, Wise also talked at length about the gender gap in engineering and tech companies. Fetch Robotics is actively trying to hire more women. And yet, Wise believes that it’s a deeper issue.
“there’s this mismatch between culture and the alignment to see women empowered,” she said. For instance, with pink toys, “you’re saying young girls need different tools than boys.”",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/fetch-robotics-melonee-wise.jpg?w=738,"melonee-wise,fetch-robotics",Fetch Robotics CEO Melonee Wise welcomes our new robot overlords
797,Romain Dillet,"The Apple TV is receiving an update today — tvOS 10. Apple announced the update at WWDC and it’s now available to download. Head over to the Settings app on your Apple TV to download the update. While it was the smallest of the updates announced at WWDC, it got even more minor over the summer as single sign-on isn’t available yet — Apple will ship this feature later this fall. Here’s what’s new in tvOS 10.
First, Siri got a bit smarter. You can now combine multiple criteria in one query. For instance, you could say “show me gangster movies from the 80s,” and Siri would then show you a list with all these criteria.
Third-party apps, such as YouTube, now also support Siri and deep links. You can say “Search YouTube for Simone Giertz” directly on the home screen. One last feature on the Siri front, you can now use your Apple TV as a HomeKit hub, meaning that you can turn off the lights or adjust the temperature of your thermostat using Siri.
Before the update, if you’ve been using a projector like me, the white interface was dazzling. Now, there is a dark mode so that you can still use your Apple TV at night.
Finally, some of the iOS 10 improvements are making their way to tvOS as well. The Photos app has been revamped with Memories. Your Apple TV automatically groups photos into albums based on location, dates and more. For instance, you should find an album with your latest vacation in the Photos app. tvOS even creates a short and sweet video compiling all these photos and videos together.
The Apple Music app has been slightly redesigned and now features new Discovery and Favorites mixes. Apple is copying Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlist with computer-generated playlists that automatically refresh every week with new songs.
And yet, one of the most interesting features is missing from today’s update — single sign-on. At WWDC, Apple promised a new feature that would make it much easier to sign into apps. With single sign-on, your cable subscription credentials will automatically sign you into Apple TV apps so you don’t have to type your password over and over again. Single sign-on didn’t make it in time for tvOS 10 and should be available later.
Apple also recently introduced a new Apple TV remote app a couple of months ago. With this app, it’s already much easier to type on your Apple TV. When you get a password field prompt, Apple sends a push notification to your phone so you can open the Apple TV remote app and type the password on your phone directly.
I’ve been playing with tvOS 10 over the summer, and it’s a fine update. There’s not much to say as it just builds on the foundations of tvOS 9 with small refinements here and there. Should you download it? Yes. Will it change the way you use your Apple TV? Probably not.",2016-09-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/apple-tv.jpg?w=738,tvos,Apple just released tvOS 10 and here’s what’s new
798,Romain Dillet,"Apple has just released iOS 10, the final version. If you want to get the latest iOS features and put a fresh coat of paint on your device, it’s time to update your iPhone or iPad. The update is currently rolling out and is available both over-the-air in the Settings app, and by plugging your device into iTunes for a wired update.
If you don’t see the update right away, don’t panic as it could take a few minutes. If you can’t download it right away, it’s because Apple now has a queue system for big updates like iOS 10 to ensure speedy downloads.
As there is going to be tremendous demand for iOS 10 with tens of millions of people trying to update their devices, it could take an hour or more before the actual download starts. But first, backup your device. Make sure your iCloud backup is up to date by going to your iPhone or iPad settings. Additionally, you can also plug your iOS device to your computer to do a manual backup in iTunes (or do both, really).
Once this is done, you should go to the Settings app as soon as possible to get in the queue. Navigate to ‘Settings,’ then ‘General’ and then ‘Software Update.’ Then you should see ‘Update Requested…” It will then automatically start downloading once the download is available.
iOS 10 features a massive Siri update with third-party integrations. For instance, you can now send money to your friends and family using Siri and various payment apps. You can also call a ride or send a message using a third-party messaging app.
Apple has also unveiled a completely redesigned lock screen with a new look for notifications. They can also now display tiny live widgets if you have an iPhone 6s or 7 with 3D Touch. iOS 10 also comes with a huge Photos app update with face recognition, deep learning categorization and intelligent photo albums. Apple Maps, Apple Music, HomeKit and the Phone app are also receiving updates.
Finally, the company is overhauling the Messages app with many, many new features — an emojify feature, message effects, Slack-like feedback on messages, rich link previews and third-party extensions.
While you download the update, why don’t you head over to our review and read about all the new features in iOS 10.

799,John Biggs,"Now your sweaty body can power your phone. Like Neo in the Matrix, a new system created by researchers at North Carolina State University lets you generate electricity with a wearable device. Previous systems used massive, rigid heat sinks. This system uses a body-conforming patch that can generate 20 μW per centimeter squared. Previous systems generated only 1 microwatt or less.
The system consists of a conducive layer that sits on the skin and prevents heat from escaping. The head moves through a thermoelectric generator and then moves into an outer layer that completely dissipates outside the body. It is 2mm thick and flexible.
The system, which is part of the National Science Foundation’s Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Advanced Self-Powered Systems of Integrated Sensors and Technologies (ASSIST), has a clear path to commercialization.
The goal is to embed these into health tools that can measure your vital signs without needing to be recharged. “The goal of ASSIST is to make wearable technologies that can be used for long-term health monitoring, such as devices that track heart health or monitor physical and environmental variables to predict and prevent asthma attacks,” said researcher Daryoosh Vashaee, an associate professor at NC State. “To do that, we want to make devices that don’t rely on batteries. And we think this design and prototype moves us much closer to making that a reality.”",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/123727_web.jpg?w=480,"wearable-technology,wearable-devices,ambient-intelligence",A new wearable generator creates electricity from body heat

As usual, Studio Neat uses high quality materials — you won’t find any plastic on these docks. Instead, the company mills walnut and combines it natural cork. Below the dock, you’ll find micro-suction material to make it stick to any surface.
The two docks vary slightly — one of them allows you to charge your iPhone while the other also has a port for your Apple Watch. With the second option, you can use the Apple Watch in nightstand mode. The combo dock is rounded while the iPhone dock is square-ish.
If you dig the design of this dock, they cost $45 for the iPhone version and $70 for the iPhone and Apple Watch version. They’re available today.

801,Haje Jan Kamps,"What’s the buzz all about at TechCrunch Disrupt? LoveNuts, that’s what. It’s a vibrator, designed to look like a funky nut — and adds the glistening sheen of plausible deniability by pretending it is a flashlight. The company claims it is “ready to rescue a woman in any kind of emergency.”
“My friend Salena had a problem,” the company’s co-founder and CEO Donald Hsu explains to me. “She lives in the same house as her mother-in-law and was horrified she would discover that she had a sex toy. So she asked me for a solution.”
That solution? Design a sex toy that doesn’t vibrate unless you “unlock” it using your bluetooth phone or tablet. Until you do (and if somebody asks) it is just a slightly curiously designed flashlight.
The product offers good vibrations, controllable from a smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth. The company has a number of prototypes that are in the process of going through thorough testing at the moment (now there’s an exhausting job if I ever heard of one) and are hoping to go into full-scale production in the near future. First of all, though, is the small question of money.

802,Ingrid Lunden,"Razer originally started as a hardware company making mice, keyboards and other peripherals optimised for dedicated computer gaming, with its mantra being “For Gamers, By Gamers.” Now, 18 years into its life, it’s changing things up a bit.
While the company continues to build hardware and its newer software business, Razer is now also announcing zVentures, a new fund of $30 million that the company plans to invest across a wide range of startups in areas like Internet of Things, big data analytics, virtual and augmented reality, robotics and Android games — all areas that Razer is already working on and planning to explore more in the future.
It will also look at startups that are working more behind the scenes but in areas that are also important for Razer as it grows. That includes those who are developing tech for supply chain management, sales and marketing, and more.
“zVentures is a fund for startups, by a startup,” Min-Liang Tan, CEO and co-founder of Razer, said. “Our focus is to bring value by sharing the solutions of our portfolio companies with the Razer community, supporting them with our hardware and software expertise and making available our global retail and distribution networks.” Tan is going to be on stage at TC Disrupt, our conference, later today, where he will talk more about the fund and Razer.
The investments will be focused on early-stage startups, with the size of investment typically ranging from $100,000 to $1 million. zVentures will be based out of San Francisco and Singapore.
The company tells me that there have already been some investments made out of the fund although it’s not yet disclosing them. There are also deals “in the pipeline” in VR, e-commerce and gaming.
The goals here are two-fold for the company: it’s helping Razer support the community around the things that it cares about as a business; and it’s helping to create a funnel of companies that might work closer with it down the line. In other words, it’s similar to many other company’s strategic investment funds, from smaller operations like the Slack Fund through to larger operations like Intel Capital. (Or perhaps more relevant, activities like HTC’s investments into areas of interest like VR.)
With the investments, Razer will also give portfolio companies access to its customer base of 20 million active users who are keen on trying new tech and are loyal to the Razer brand; Razer’s software and hardware expertise; and its distribution network.
We’d been hearing some murmurs about this fund for a while now, although this is the first official news about it. ZVentures is a development on two smaller, $5 million funds that Razer already had. One, revealed earlier this year, is called the OSVR Development Fund. It is being used specifically to invest in startups building open-source VR content for multiple platforms. As with the larger zVentures fund, the idea is to make strategic investments: Razer itself is also building headgear compliant with open source and this is to make sure that there will be a big mix of content being made for it.
The other is another $5 million fund that Razer has been quietly using to advance Android gaming as part of OUYA Publishing, which it picked up in its acquisition of Android gaming console OUYA in 2015. Both of these $5 million funds are now getting rolled into zVentures and the $30 million total, Razer tells me.
While Razer itself is kicking in some money directly to zVentures, there are other backers in it, too, comprised of some of the company’s own investors, the company told me. It wouldn’t specify which of these are involved. To date, Razer has disclosed around $125 million in funding, although as we reported in 2014 there was also a round led by Intel whose size Razer never disclosed (but has confirmed) that catapulted its valuation into the $1 billion range (it’s now valued at more than $1.5 billion). In addition to Intel, its investors include Accel, IDG, Temasek’s Heliconia Capital Management, and China’s LianLuo.",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-12-at-09-05-09.png?w=738,razer,"Razer launches zVentures, a new $30M fund for IoT, robotics, VR and gaming startups"
803,Sarah Perez,"TiVo this morning announced the launch of a new product in its BOLT family of DVRs, the BOLT+. While the 4K-ready BOLT, which debuted last fall, featured a white chassis and unique, curved shape, the BOLT+ instead returns to the standard black body, even while it maintains the odd form factor. More importantly, it offers more storage (3 TB) and more tuners (six are included), as compared with the older model.
With 3 TB of recording capabilities, TiVo BOLT+ can record 450 hours of HD content, the company says, while the additional tuners mean you can record and stream more programs at the same time.
The original BOLT arrived with the choice between a 500 GB or 1 TB hard disk drive, and four tuners, for comparison’s sake.
These changes basically make the BOLT+ more like an upgraded Roamio Pro, except for the fact that the new DVR offers support for 4K streaming, as well.
In addition, the BOLT+ offers other features included in the BOLT, like SkipMode, QuickMode, OneSearch, OnePass and mobile streaming.
SkipMode and QuickMode were big additions, in terms of TiVo’s software, when the BOLT was first unveiled. QuickMode lets you watch 30 percent faster, with pitch-corrected audio – which makes sense for digesting certain kinds of media, like news, sports, or educational programs where you’re trying to glean information, but not necessarily partake in the traditional, lean-back TV watching experience.
With SkipMode, TiVo lets users push a button once to move to the next part of the program without having to view commercials.
In an era where more people than ever are cutting the cord with pay TV services in favor of ad-free online streaming alternatives, like Netflix, a commercial-skipping option was a must-have for TiVo. Unfortunately, it’s not available for all recorded shows, the company notes.
TiVo also made a point to mention that its device can be used as a Plex client – something that could appeal also to the cord-cutting community, who often use the media server software Plex to watch content from their own home libraries.
Meanwhile, TiVo features like OnePass and OneSearch aim to simplify the now fragmented TV landscape where programming is spread out across numerous networks and a variety of online services for streaming, rental and purchase. OnePass lets you consolidate all the episodes of a favorite show via your cable TV service and online services like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, for example, in order to create a universal watchlist.
OneSearch lets you search for shows and movies across local channels and internet video at the same time.
Also like BOLT, the new BOLT+ lets you watch live TV and recorded shows remotely using either a smartphone or tablet in the home when you’re on the same network. You can download and stream some programs while out of the home, too, but this is dependent on the copyright restrictions put in place by the content providers. Out-of-home streaming is only supported on one device at a time, TiVo says.
The TiVo BOLT+ will be available for $499.99 beginning on September 15. It will be sold online at TiVo’s website, plus Amazon, Magnolia retail stores, and custom install dealers nationwide.",2016-09-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/bolt-plus.jpg?w=738,"cord-cutting,dvr,tivo","TiVo debuts its newest DVR, the 4K-ready BOLT+ with 6 tuners"
804,Darrell Etherington,"How do you convince a potential car buyer your vehicle is a future-focused choice? One way is to get one of the most iconic creators of cinematic futurescapes to help you build a virtual world that people can drive the car through themselves. Toyota enlisted Syd Mead, the creative visionary behind Blade Runner and Tron‘s vehicles, architecture and more.
Mead provided concept art and designs for Toyota’s VR Prius Prime experience at Disrupt SF 16, which I tried out myself in a sneak preview earlier today. The demo includes a Tilt Brush-like immersive artistic creation component, followed by a “4D” VR ride.
“The idea of inspiring new views into the world of future automotive reality was too exciting to turn down,” Mead said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “Toyota has created a new world of mobility; a concept realized in a remarkable Virtual Reality tour that brings the future into our world of today.”
Both the art piece and the drive use the HTC Vive, with the ride portion adding physical driver’s seat, complete with the actual steering wheel from the Prius Prime itself. You don’t actually do much driving with the steering wheel, as it moves itself along with the action in the VR world, and the seat moves around to make it feel more like you’re right inside the short featurette as it rolls.
Toyota tapped creative agency Saatchi & Saatchi to create the VR feature, including a custom-built painting environment similar to Tilt Brush. The original plan was actually to use Tilt Brush itself, according to Saatchi & Saatchi Executive Creator Director Dwayne Koh, but they ran into an issue where the Google software couldn’t export the artwork created by users, which is actually used by the immersive driving simulation later on. Koh also noted that their own software lets you paint one-handed, which is much more accessible for casual first-time users.
The drive itself takes you through an animated world featuring landscapes and other cars pulled from Mead’s imagination, and it’s actually really convincing when paired with the movements from the seat. You actually have to buckle up when you use it, which I thought was just something to encourage safety in a cutesy way, but which actually is designed to prevent people potentially being thrown from the bucket seat.
Actually using the demo station was pretty easy, with guides helping you through the process of creating your virtual art, and then handing you off to the driving pod, where you belt yourself into the seat and put your hands on the wheel. The narrative involves a stranger in a bit of a jam looking for a ride, and you volunteering to help him deliver a package. Said package actually ends up being (spoiler alert) the art you created earlier.
It lasts a few minutes long, and the VR combined with the motion seat actually did make me a bit queasy, but that’s not unusual for me with VR. In the end the feeling was only fleeting, and really only at the beginning of the drive.
Overall, it’s an interesting experiment in marketing and immersive narrative, but one that still leaves me thinking we still have a long way to go before we get to a place where the average VR storytelling experience is enjoyable for most.",2016-09-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_0347.jpg?w=738,toyota,Toyota’s VR drive through a Syd Mead-created world is a near-future trip

Who would want such witchcraft? 360-degree video is pretty cool stuff and it could mean that we can expect more VR video on Youtube and other services. Because the camera films at 4K you can also grab some nice video of your various exciting activities and stream them live to YouTube and Facebook.

806,Devin Coldewey,"We’ve seen 3D printed cameras before, but they always include some prefabricated part: a hinge, a spring, or more complicated bits like shutters and iris mechanisms. But designer Amos Dudley has done what I’ve always hoped someone would do: make a camera entirely out of 3D printed parts — yes, including the lens.
He used a Form 2 SLA printer, which can put out objects using a variety of resin types — a flexible one for one piece, a rigid one for another, a colored one for one piece, a clear one for another. It prints at a high enough precision (sub-millimeter) that things like small gear teeth or other interacting machine parts can be produced without the need to do lots of manual post-work knocking off pieces or sanding them down.
The enclosure, film sprocket, and iris are all more or less straightforward — the latter has a rather organic look from the way its resin blades slide past each other.
For the shutter, Dudley rejected a few common mechanically simple designs and found a solution in a camera from 1885. Two mirror image planes swoop past one another when the shutter button is pushed, moving from blocking the aperture in one position to blocking it in the other — but while they move, the way is clear. In Dudley’s design, you end up having to press one shutter button to switch them one way and another to switch them back, and there are no set exposure times, but it works.

The amazing part is the lens. First Dudley worked out exactly what optical qualities he’d need, simulating the parts and distances involved in a ray tracer. Then he actually printed it out using a high-quality transparent resin and sanded it down with a custom machine. Then a dip in liquid resin fills in the tiny valleys and flaws, making the lens, if not optically perfect, at least functional. It’s spherical, so there’s problems towards the edges of the frame, but with the aperture limited and other factors accounted for in the body of the camera, it works!
Pop a little film in there (Fujicolor Superia 400 — can’t 3D print that… yet) and it’s ready for its close-ups. Because it has a fixed focus, and not a very distant one.
The rest of the photos are in Dudley’s Flickr stream.
It’s quite an amazing accomplishment, and hopefully it will spur others with similar ideas to create similar devices of their own. Or you could just follow Dudley’s process for practice; the 3D models and other specs are available here.",2016-09-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/qwcglgq.jpg?w=738,"photography,cameras",Every single part of this camera is 3D printed
807,Devin Coldewey,"What do you do if you want to peek inside a book, but you’re pretty sure it’ll crumble into dust if you even crack the cover a little bit? Well, nothing: Opening a book is a critical step in finding out what’s inside. Or at least it was until someone at MIT decided that shouldn’t be the case.
The researchers combined a couple of powerful techniques to make this possible. Terahertz imaging passes through paper and cover but the radiation is also reflected differently by paper and ink, unlike longer wavelengths like x-rays.
Then there’s femtophotography, a clever way of capturing certain types of imagery just trillionths of a second apart. This lets extremely fine distinctions be made, such as whether a reflected image comes from one page or the next one a fraction of a millimeter down.

The result is terahertz femtophotography, and the researchers were able to make it determine the distance to the first 20 pages of a book, and it could pick out individual letters printed on the first 9. There was only one letter per page, but still, how well can you read through the cover?
“The Metropolitan Museum in New York showed a lot of interest in this, because they want to, for example, look into some antique books that they don’t even want to touch,” said Barmak Heshmat, one of the authors of the paper, in an MIT news release.


The tech could also be used on things other than books: layers of paint, for example, in a famous piece of art, or materials stacked tightly in archaeological samples.
It’s all out of MIT’s Camera Culture group. A more technical breakdown of the process can be found in this video or in the paper published today in Nature Communications.

808,Ingrid Lunden,"French-American big data startup Talend made its debut as a public company today with a pop. After pricing its shares at $18 last night (above the expected range of $15-$17), the company began trading on Nasdaq under the ticker TLND at $27.66, up 54 percent on its IPO price, giving the company an implied valuation of $537 million.
However, in the immediate hour after opening, the stock declined about 14 percentage points and it closed at $25.50. 
The offering at $18/share the night before raised $94.5 million and was above the company’s expected range of $15-17 and raise of $86.3 million.
Talend’s debut is encouraging news for those who have been wondering about the health of the tech IPO market. There have been very few listings this year, and while Twilio had a strong entry (and continues to pick up speed), Talend — which provides a platform for Hadoop or Spark integration and data management services, disrupting more traditional and costly data warehousing services — could be a sign of more positive reception for IPOs to come, particularly in the area of enterprise services. Some of the hopefuls that we’ve heard might be eyeing up public listings soon include Dropbox, Okta and Puppet Labs.
There seems to be an appetite for more if the metrics are right. In an interview after the stock opened for trading, CEO Mike Tuchen said that part of the reason the company priced above its estimated range was because after the road show, Talend’s bankers said they’d seen much more interest than they had expected. “The fact that we’re cash-flow positive, and our market differentiation,” were two reasons for the positive reception, he said.
Talend’s listing is also positive news for those who wonder about how international startups might fare in U.S. markets at the moment. As a startup, Talend raised just over $100 million from the likes of Silver Lake but also a strong slate of French and European investors like Bpifrance, Balderton, Idinvest, and Iris Capital Partners. It was founded in France in 2005, and now has two headquarters: in Suresnes in the outskirts of Paris and Redwood City, California.
And investors are willing to invest in tech companies that are not immediately profitable. Talend competes against the likes of other public companies like Splunk and Hortonworks, but also privately held businesses like Apatar and Jitterbit. It posted a net loss of $22 million last year on revenues of $76 million. Notably, that loss was level with the year before, while revenues were up from $62.6 million, meaning the company is growing and improving, slowly.
Late last night, Tuchen pointed out that the company was still in its “early days.”
“Today is an important milestone which became possible, in part, because of our singular focus on enabling organizations of all types to become data driven – an increasingly necessary skill in a world where data has become a strategic asset,” he said in a statement. “As notable as today’s milestone is though, we are still in the early days of our journey. We’re looking forward to maximizing the opportunity we have in front of us and building our business for long-term success.
“With the amount of data available for decision-making increasing exponentially, and the technology to analyze and act on that data more capable, cost-effective, and ubiquitous, IT infrastructures are undergoing an industry-wide, transformative shift toward new big data and cloud platforms. Talend’s solutions are well-suited to address that exciting opportunity and help position us to extend our leadership role in next-generation data integration.”
This is one area where the IPO will help the company. This listing essentially doubles the amount of money that it had raised in its time as a private company. The CEO said because that money is not needed to operate the company since it is cash-flow positive, it would be used for things like acquisitions.
“This gives us the opportunity to look at technology tuck-ins in neighboring markets customers may want to buy from, or to deepen our solution in areas we already service.” He declined to say which areas might interest Talend, “but there are always startups out there that are interesting, and we [as an industry] are going through an enormous amount of consolidation.”

809,Ron Miller,"When Oracle bought NetSuite yesterday for a cool $9.3 billion in cash, it let the world know it was now totally serious about growing cloud computing revenue. That wasn’t always the case.
In the early days of the cloud, Oracle was content to sit on the sidelines and make fun, while it raked in traditional license and maintenance revenue. In fact, CEO Larry Ellison famously ridiculed the cloud in a 2008 interview, saying the computer industry was “more fashion-driven than women’s fashion” when it came to cloud computing.
Times have changed, however and as the industry has shifted toward the cloud, Oracle finds itself far behind in a market dominated by AWS, Salesforce, Microsoft and Google.
That left it two choices — build or buy. While Oracle has been in the process of building out its own cloud infrastructure, and its cloud revenue has been growing,  it also had to recognize that it’s hard to play catchup. An easy way to grab market share it to buy an existing company with a big customer list.
One thing Oracle has plenty of, is money. According to YCharts, Oracle had over $56 billion in cash prior to yesterday’s shopping spree. While the price tag was a big chunk of money by any measure, it was money the database giant could afford to spend, and it appears to have gotten a fair amount of bang for its buck.

With NetSuite, Oracle has a cloud enterprise resource planning (ERP) product, which offers financial software delivered via the cloud. In fact, one of its claims to fame is that more companies have IPO’d using NetSuite than any other company (according to Constellation Research).
One of the interesting aspects of this deal is that NetSuite and Oracle were already pals with Ellison investing in the company early on. Yet Oracle went out and spent top dollar anyway.
“Larry Ellison was actually involved in setting up NetSuite in the late 90s, and prior to its going public, held a large share of the company,” Digital Clarity Group analyst, Jill Finger Gibson told TechCrunch.
But it was more than a friend helping a friend. There was a core business reason for this purchase around cloud revenue. “Oracle is rapidly shifting its business model from licenses and maintenance to cloud subscriptions. NetSuite accelerates this revenue shift, adding nearly $1 billion in revenues to Oracle’s SaaS portfolio. NetSuite gives Oracle the Number One position in SaaS ERP, supplementing its Oracle Cloud ERP offering,” Forrester analyst Paul Hamerman told TechCrunch.
The deal also gives Oracle entrée into the valuable mid-market, an area it could exploit further with NetSuite in the fold. “NetSuite has always made a very conscious choice to go after [the mid-market] segment, and while Oracle is still considered primarily an enterprise player, there are many more mid-market companies than enterprise companies, so for future growth, Oracle needs to better penetrate that segment,” Gibson said.
Of course, it didn’t hurt that making the purchase keeps NetSuite out of the hands of rivals like SAP and Salesforce.
There is always going to be customer anxiety when it comes to a deal like this, especially when a player the size of Oracle is involved, but whether it’s a positive move for NetSuite’s customers depends on who you ask.
R Ray Wang, principal analyst and founder at Constellation Research mostly sees business as usual, but warns that customers may want to make deals with NetSuite sooner than later.
“Oracle has had a good history with post-merger integration. NetSuite will be able to take advantage of many of Oracle’s technical assets and customers can expect to benefit from the synergies. Customers should try to renew more favorable terms before Oracle takes over in order to sign more beneficial contracts,” Wang said.
Forrester’s Hamerman isn’t so sure customers will win in this deal as Oracle could put the price squeeze on them. “Oracle will likely put more price pressure on NetSuite renewals and impose more regimented support procedures, undermining NetSuite’s congenial SaaS culture,” he said.
That said, Hamerman believes that customers could benefit if Oracle uses its deep pockets to update the NetSuite technology stack and deepen its capabilities.
The deal could mark the beginning of the end for some NetSuite employees as Oracle tends to move aggressively to remove employee overlap. “[NetSuite] had a net loss of about $125 million in 2015, with its largest operating expense being sales and marketing (65% of total expenses). It’s likely that there will likely be a bunch of redundancies among NetSuite sales and marketing employees,” Gibson said.
A big winner here is Ellison himself, who used his company’s money to take a big player off of the board, and gains personal wealth in the process. “Ellison really wins — he own [around 40 percent] of the company personally. How nice to be able to make a personal profit like that and pay yourself from your own business. Wow.” Scott Liewehr, Digital Clarity Group president said.
As with any deal, there are no guarantees about how well the organizations combine or how well Oracle can mix a SaaS vendor with a different culture into its company, but given the price tag and Oracle’s track record of buying and subsuming companies, it certainly has history in its favor — even if it didn’t always love the cloud.",2016-07-29,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/gettyimages-494272836.jpg?w=738,"erp,mergers-and-acquisitions,netsuite",Oracle takes the cloud revenue fast track with $9.3 billion Netsuite deal
810,Darrell Etherington,"Oracle will acquire NetSuite for about $9.3 billion, or $109 per share in an all-cash deal, the companies announced Thursday. Both Oracle and NetSuite’s cloud service offerings aimed at enterprise customers will continue to operate and “coexist in the marketplace forever,” according to a statement by Oracle CEO Mark Hurd.
Hurd called NetSuite and Oracle’s offerings “complementary” in the release, adding that Oracle intends to continue to invest in the engineering and distribution aspects of both company’s products going forward.
Eighteen-year-old NetSuite claims a dominant position in the cloud enterprise resource planning (ERP) space, which includes offerings to help businesses track supply and demand, inventory, accounting, customer relationships (CRM) and HR. The ERP industry has been an active space for M&A and general consolidation over the past few years, and Oracle in general has been an aggressive acquirer of smaller companies throughout 2016, with recent pick-ups including Opower and Textura.
Oracle’s acquisition of NetSuite dwarfs its previous 2016 acquisitions in total deal value, though it still ranks below the all-time leader – PeopleSoft, which Oracle acquired for a heady $10.3 billion way back in 2004, when such stratospheric values were even more uncommon.
While their service offerings are similar, NetSuite offers Oracle access to companies sized smaller than its traditional clientele, and could also give it some additional competitive edge in taking on primary rival Salesforce.",2016-07-28,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/6939d252d9af4c1aa282b6129e5a908a.jpg?w=738,netsuite,Oracle buys enterprise cloud services company NetSuite for $9.3B
811,Matthew Lynley,"Apple needed a breakout quarter after its last whiff, and boy did it get one.
The company reported revenue of $42.4 billion and earnings of $1.42 per share. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.38 per share on revenue of $42.09 billion. As a result the company added tens of billions of value back to its share price, which rose more than 6% in extended trading. (6% might not feel like a lot, but for a company worth more than $500 billion, it’s a huge amount of value.)
That’s still a down quarter from last year. Apple then reported revenue of $49.6 billion on earnings of $1.85 per share. But that’s to be expected as the company’s core growth engine — the iPhone — has started to reach a saturation point and slow. Apple said it sold 40.4 million iPhones, compared to 51.2 million in the last quarter. But the last year has been largely iterative for the company.
This quarter largely shows an extension of that storyline. Revenue is no longer in growth mode, and iPhone sales are declining. But with industry watchers finally setting expectations that the company isn’t in full-on growth mode any more, it looks like positive news from the company is positive news for investors, who are still looking for new ways to value the company.
We have another big story coming out of today’s earnings report as well: its cash pile actually decreased for the first time in recent memory. But the company has also been investing aggressively, recently writing a $1 billion check for Uber rival Didi Chuxing. Does this signal a new phase of Apple being more open to weaponizing its massive cash pile as it looks to find new avenues for growth? Hard to tell just yet — it’s only one quarter — but it might not be entirely surprising as the company looks to diversify its revenue streams.
Last quarter was a pivotal moment for Apple. The company showed its first revenue decline in 13 years, missing analyst expectations by a mile. iPhone sales, Apple’s main growth driver, were significantly down from the second quarter a year earlier. That sparked a lot of concern that Apple’s core engine may have — actually, most likely — has hit a saturation point.
As a result of that report, Apple’s stock promptly fell off a cliff. $40 billion in value for the company was wiped out in a single afternoon. Google has been nipping at Apple’s heeels, and at some moments seemed likely that it would permanently overtake the position of the most valuable company in the world (as it did at one point, momentarily). Apple’s stock has really yet to recover from that fall in the last quarter, but today was certainly a big help.
This is also the first full quarter that the company’s revamp of the 4-inch iPhone, the cheaper iPhone SE, was for sale. That gave consumers an option to buy a less expensive phone from Apple, and upgrade from their iPhone 5 or 5S for those looking for a smaller phone. But having a cheaper phone has the potential to cut into Apple’s margins on its more expensive, more premium devices.
We may now be seeing signs of that. Apple’s gross margin — a key metric that industry watchers focus on — was down to 38% from 39.7%. Apple devices are largely considered premium devices, and as such having a high gross margin is key to the company’s success. Apple’s guidance showed an even further decline, aiming for between 37.5% and 38% for the fourth quarter this year (right before the next iPhone is expected to come out).

“We also unveiled the stunning 9.7-inch iPad Pro with cutting-edge performance and our most advanced display yet,” Cook said on the last earnings call. “The reviews of our new iPad Pros have been great, and we’re hearing from customers that the features and capabilities in the new Pros make them both the ultimate upgrade for iPad owners and a great PC replacement. In the June quarter, we expect to see our best iPad revenue compare in over 2 years.”
Analysts were expecting iPad sales of 9.1 million units. It turns out that it got more than what people were looking for — reporting that it sold 10 million iPads. But one interesting note is that the revenue it brought in from the iPad actually grew from $4.4 billion to $4.9 billion compared to the same quarter a year ago. As far as reading the tea leaves go, that looks like an interesting directionally positive data point.
All eyes will, as such, be on Q4 and the unveiling of the iPhone 7. Apple’s last blowout performance came with the launch of the iPhone 6, which finally introduced a line of larger iPhones that proved to have extensive demand. It’s on Apple to find a way to re-ignite its core growth engine with the rest of its divisions being relatively ho-hum.
So, to recap, here’s the final scorecard:",2016-07-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/465698354.jpg?w=738,"earnings,aapl16q3","Apple beats earnings expectations by a mile, and its stock is soaring"
812,Lora Kolodny,"A Tel Aviv-based startup called Propsera has raised $7 million in new venture funding to build out systems that will monitor and help farmers improve the health of their crops, and optimize their operations.
Bessemer Venture Partners led the Series A round.
Prospera CEO and co-founder Daniel Koppel said agriculture professionals have plenty of tech at their disposal today from soil and weather sensors, to aerial images and other data attained by drone and satellite services.
But farmers still don’t have the complete picture that they need to optimize production of their crops. For example, all those high-tech tools and services aren’t telling farmers when diseases like late blight or tuta absoluta are beginning to take hold of their potatoes or tomatoes.
Prospera’s systems, installed in greenhouses or in the field, use a proximal RGB camera and cloud-based software to gather and analyze all the information farmers are missing.
Prospera applies machine learning to report when something important is happening in the field, not every two weeks when a scout walks their fields, he said, but not overwhelming ag professionals with information that isn’t noteworthy.
With diseases like those mentioned above, early diagnosis can help farmers forecast yields and make up for expected losses with other growing efforts, or possibly contain the problem and save their crops.
Prospera intends to use some of its Series A capital to work with a design services firm to overhaul its hardware, the CEO said. The Prospera device, which is installed in greenhouses or in the field, already includes: a solar panel, camera, and temperature, humidity and light (radiation) sensors.
It allows farmers a much more precise view of what’s happening with their crops than any satellite and drone-based imagery, Koppel claimed. And it works for vertical, i.e. indoor, farms which wouldn’t usually be helped by aerial services.
“We can see things like how plants are growing, the color of the plants, the density and quality of flowers, berries, where the bees are, or if a disease is showing up on a leaf.” Koppel said.
The company’s software can also help farmers understand exactly what people did in the field to their plants, and when. The idea is that if they got great results, farmers can direct workers to do the same things, and create the same conditions for their plants again. And if they didn’t get great results, they can pinpoint what hasn’t worked so well in the past and change tack.
Prospera’s technology is already being used by farms, especially in Spain and Mexico. Its clients include: Walmart, Tesco, Sainsburys, and Aldi, the startup said.
Given its new funding, Prospera also intends to expand beyond the European greenhouses where it sees most of its business today into row crops and vineyards, and possibly even nascent markets like legal cannabis in the U.S.
The company is facing serious competition in agtech including from PrecisionHawk and DJI who partnered to create a crop health  monitoring drone service, and Arable, whose crop health monitoring device was co-designed by Fred Bould, the creative force behind the Nest, Roku and other popular hardware.",2016-07-26,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/tomatoes_greenhouse_prospera.png?w=738,"computer-vision,machine-vision,ai",Prospera raises $7 million to put computer vision and AI to work on the farm
813,Matthew Lynley,"Zenefits has been under fire for skirting regulation, resulting in the ouster of its previous CEO Parker Conrad and a heavy-duty overhaul underway of the company.
The results of that effort are now seemingly starting to emerge, starting first with a resolution in Tennessee which will cost the company $62,500 and allow it to continue operating. The company continues to have conversations with other regulatory commissions as it works to convince them that it has changed its tenor and is now ready to comply with regulations when it comes to operating its business. The hope here, it would seem, is that Zenefits is setting a precedent that it has left that behavior behind and doesn’t need to be severely punished going forward.
This basically amounts to a slap on the wrist for the company, which previously instituted a program called “the Macro” that helped it skirt regulatory requirements in order to grow more quickly. That, in the short term, helped the company quickly rocket to a $4.5 billion valuation, but a series of reports lifting the veil on that behavior — as well as the company’s party culture — has forced Zenefits to basically make a 180.
“Fortunately, new company leadership has demonstrated a dedication to righting the ship,” Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance commissioner Julie Mix McPeak said in a statement. “They have instituted new and enhanced agent training requirements as well as licensing controls to ensure that company employees comply with state licensing laws. They employed a reputable outside firm to help test and confirm these new procedures.”
That started with Parker leaving the company and COO David Sacks taking over, as well as change in the board of directors. It also led to a series of layoffs, including offering employees a generous buyout package for those not interested in sticking around as it works to remake the company’s culture and operations. Around 10% of employees accepted the offer, which amounted to about two months’ severance.
Most recently, Zenefits pared back its valuation to $2 billion and restructured ownership stakes in the company as a continuing effort to reset expectations as it worked to change its direction — and likely the speed of its growth along with it. That decision would help it fend off potential lawsuits from investors who were kept in the dark regarding “the Macro.”

“I also want to thank our employees for doing the hard work of remediation,” Sacks said in a statement. “You have changed our company’s culture and values at a fundamental level. Because of your efforts, Zenefits has reached a watershed moment: not only does this agreement pave the way for us to continue operating in the great state of Tennessee, it also recognizes that Zenefits is a new company that has moved past its historical issues. We look forward to reaching resolution with other states soon.”
Of course, this does not mean Zenefits will get the same treatment in other states. The company is under investigation in a few states including Washington and California, as first reported by BuzzFeed. Those states may seek to impose harsher terms on Zenefits, which has actively tried to investigate and self-report violations as a way to help reduce the potential impact on its business.",2016-07-25,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-12-at-11-37-57-am.png?w=738,"david-sacks,parker-conrad",Zenefits gets a small fine in resolving regulatory concerns in Tennessee
814,John Biggs,"One of the saddest scenes in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy is watching the slow-moving Ents – the massive tree shepherds that took days to decide whether or not to react Sauron’s onslaught – are cut down by the wily Orcs. Only a few fall in the battle but when they do the giants of the forests that at first seemed so powerful are exposed to be easily vanquished. They won the battle but we can presume the fallen ones made great kindling for the Orc’s fires.
Yahoo isn’t kindling yet but it – like the mighty AOL Ent on which you’re reading this – has fallen. Mayer’s Old Web property is now part of a phone company, a prospect that would be unfathomable when the first web portals hit the scene.
Think about Yahoo’s mission. Originally a catalog of important things on the web it became what Year 2000 dot-commers called a portal. It was, at its core, a sort of app store with multiple features including chat, weather, mail, and photo storage. It was an early, simple web-based operating system and it was as far away from the backward, boring infrastructure companies that were then trying to figure out a way forward in the online economy.
But infrastructure has one thing going for it: it has revenue, year after year, and that revenue can be used to take down upstarts when they’re weak. That’s exactly what happened here.
Yahoo wasn’t always doomed. It was once, like AOL, a web giant. It still gathers millions of eyeballs and plenty of traffic. But then slowly (then quickly) Google overtook all comers with its superior search and that search revenue helped the company expand away from its core business leading it to create a true app store as well as a truly powerful mobile infrastructure. Yahoo and AOL, for their parts, focused on ad automation and when Facebook ate a piece of that pie they had little left to fight over. The once mighty giants were struck blow after blow and they couldn’t survive.
What is Verizon doing with its relics of Internet Past? Not much. They have been fairly hands-off with AOL (and this site) and their interest, I suspect, is in building a media conglomerate like Disney or Comcast – a set of businesses that report to the mothership and use synergy and shared goals to raise all boats. Whether or not a company like Verizon whose primary expertise is in setting up cell towers can do this is still up in the proverbial air but here’s hoping.
There aren’t many tech giants left. Hardware greats like Xerox, Cisco, and Nokia are moribund. Software houses like Oracle and Microsoft are doing enough to be dangerous and little more. And old-guard websites are basically no more except perhaps Amazon and Drudge. If the 2010s have brought anything it’s been a wholesale cleanout of massive tech brands and the rise of hundreds of orc-like replacements.
The thing that is sadder still is that more giants will fall over the next few years. Gawker is already teetering, about the fall into the ZDNet swamps. Travel stalwarts like Kayak and CheapCaribbean are being replaced by low cost travel apps that reduce the complexity of booking a trip to nil. Advertising companies have been swallowed up one by one until there are only a few left. The only things really left to disrupt are online banking and commodity web hosting and those spaces are deeply entrenched.
Yahoo was the last of the giants. There are plenty of smaller companies still around from the 1990s but they were always scurrying in Yahoo’s shadow. Now the company’s forward facing tools and media services will be folded into Verizon and when Yahoo employees become AOL employees it will be harder to separate out what was Yahoo and what wasn’t. Like the venerable Treebeard, Yahoo will put down roots, grow leaves, and become part of the undifferentiated forest. It was sad but expected.",2016-07-25,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/maxresdefault1.jpg?w=738,"alibaba-group,aol,world-wide-web",The giant’s fall
815,Sarah Perez,"The popular password management utility Dashlane is going after the larger enterprise market today with the announcement of a new tool that will allow mobile employees to switch access between both their personal passwords, as well as those assigned to them by their workplace, in the company’s mobile app.
The tool, which is known as “Spaces,” first launched on the desktop this summer.
However, as a desktop-only tool, Spaces was not a complete solution given today’s highly mobile workforce and their need to log into corporate resources from phones and tablets, in addition to laptop computers.
With the company’s Business solution, which starts at $2/month per user, I.T. administrators can remotely deploy the software to end users’ machines, onboard new users, assign credentials, sync changes, track usage and more.

On mobile, this level of enterprise control continues, as employers will now be able to do things like immediately restrict access to work accounts, without the employee losing their credentials saved in their “Personal Space.” This is helpful for when employees exit the company, for example.
The software also includes a learning algorithm that analyzes new web pages, offers auto-login and auto-fill functionality, and password generation features.
And Dashlane touts that it’s the first password manager to provide businesses with support for the FIDO Alliance’s Universal Second Factor authentication (U2F) protocol and U2F-enabled YubiKeys. These add an extra layer of protection without needing to type in two-factor codes sent over email or text, and instead let employees log in via a tap.
Plus, the software lets I.T. enforce that passwords are changed regularly, which can help make accounts less vulnerable to hacks.

The Spaces feature presents itself simply to the end user, allowing them to see which items are work or personal thanks to badges shown next to the credentials, as well as a “Recent Items” view that lets them find their most-often used password more quickly.
Dashlane’s enterprise expansion comes at an opportune time for the company. Even as the world reels from numerous and repeated large-scale data breaches and hacks, businesses continue to move more of their resources into the cloud where multiple sets of user credentials are required for authentication.
The company notes that, by the year 2018, over 70 percent of mobile professionals will conduct their work on personal smart devices. But often, these devices are vulnerable to security issues. Citing a study from HP, Dashlane also points out that 97 percent of the applications on mobile devices contained some sort of privacy issue, 86 percent of apps lack basic security defenses, and 75 percent fail to properly encrypt data.
Meanwhile, without software to simplify account creation and enforce password policies, users tend to fall back on poor security practices. This includes re-using their same password on various sites (65 percent of employees do); sharing passwords insecurely (1 in 3 do); or using weak passwords (63 percent of enterprise data breaches involved hackers using weak, default or stolen passwords.)
As of May, Dashlane reported over 5 million users in 150 countries. At the same time, it announced its $22.5 million Series C round of funding with plans to expand its enterprise footprint. Thanks to lead investor TransUnion, the company also said it will partner with banks to aid with services like fraud and online payment protection in the future, as well.

816,Ingrid Lunden,"A mass migration of IT services to the cloud, coupled with a huge growth of connected devices, has created a perfect storm for security breaches with some 400 million malware attacks identified last year alone according to IDC. Now, a new hopeful called StackPath believes it might have the key (and size) to fighting malicious hackers once and for all.
The company is emerging out of stealth today with a whopping $180 million in funding plus four significant acquisitions right out of the gate — MaxCDN, Fireblade, Cloak and Staminus — to launch a security-as-a-service platform but also fill out its network with customers. MaxCDN alone brings 16,000 customers to the new startup, and Cloak brings 15,000.
The funding is led by $150 million from ABRY Partners, the big private equity firm, along with a further $30 million from unnamed “insiders” the company tells me. It’s not clear whether the acquisitions are being made out of that funding or if they are separate to this. The financial terms, and valuation of StackPath, are not being disclosed but we are trying to find out.
StackPath is not your ordinary security startup. For starters, it is founded by Lance Crosby — the founder and CEO of SoftLayer, which was acquired by IBM in 2013 for $2 billion, forming the basis of its new-wave cloud computing business. And second of all, is the company’s main premise. The company is banking on the premise of building a massive security platform, and going big with a flexible SaaS-style product, as a key part of how it tackles the issue of security.
There have been dozens of startups in the world of security that are taking completely new approaches to tacking the problem using new techniques around artificial intelligence, or inspired by military formations, for example, to help conceptualise and shape products.
StackPath sees opportunity in offering a variety of services in a climate where businesses are increasingly buying things like security software and other IT services on a pay-as-you-go basis, rather than large cash outlays for products on large contracts that might also include costly hardware (especially in the case of security services).
“The Internet is where the world does business. It may be the single most important utility supporting businesses today, yet we continue to overtax the ageing infrastructure and struggle to make it secure,” said Lance Crosby, CEO of StackPath, in a statement.
“The StackPath platform is an integrated response to a fragmented problem created by too many individual, appliance-based, bolt-on security solutions. It’s time to give businesses internet services that have security built in, not bolted on—so they can be reliable guardians of their most precious assets. We appreciate the support from Abry Partners as we continue our mission of building a path to a secure internet.”
Among other key hires at StackPath are Andrew Higginbotham, COO and president, who had been SVP of cloud and technology at CenturyLink; and Kim Sheehy, CFO, who joins from CyrusOne (CONE).
StackPath, of course, will be tapping into things like machine learning and more. Services will be delivered in the form of APIs, and in each case, the StackPath’s platform will ‘learn’ more about threats based on the data gathered through each of its services. “It effectively deputizes each service on the host network with the authority to identify and communicate real-time threats against it to an intelligent data repository,” the company notes.
The company’s bigger vision is to create a platform to offer users a variety of different security services, but it says that it will start first with secure content delivery (using tech from MaxCDN, presumably).
This will launch in August and will be priced in tiers starting at $20 per user and per month, up to $600 per user per month, depending on aspects like bandwidth size, secure token numbers, and will include several features:

The four companies that have been acquired are bringing a range of services and customers into the mix, some of which will be made apparent more immediately than others, depending on the timing of new features that get launched:
MaxCDN is described as a “next generation content delivery network” that is built on Varnish and Nginx, and uses caching technology to accelerate websites and applications. And it is already a very established business: it has 19 global PoPs and more than 16,000 customers. StackPath says it has migrated this technology stack to its new platform with built-in security features such as WAF and DDOS.
Fireblade is a web application firewall provider originally founded in Israel that uses “a patented behavioral and data-driven approach to risk mitigation.” It processes traffic data in real-time and “pushes new conclusions and rules immediately to respond to emerging threats and botnet attacks.” Fireblade has already been integrated into StackPath’s platform, the company said.
Staminus is an anti-DDoS provides that already has a reputation in the market, as well as patents. While today its tech is based on appliances and a global network of scrubbing centers, StackPath says its DDoS mitigation capacities “have been completely integrated into StackPath’s PoP and network architecture to protect StackPath’s network and its customers from the largest and most sophisticated DDoS attacks.”
Lastly, Cloak — which actually quietly announced its acquisition back in April — is a leading consumer VPN platform with native iOS and Mac applications to allow people to securely use the internet while on untrusted networks, by way of encrypted tunnels. (Android and Windows are on the way, the company says.) This is especially useful in the current work environment where many people bring their own devices and use them to work. The company is very established, with 1 million downloads to date and 15,000 paying users. The company will help StackPath target both small/medium businesses as well as large enterprises.",2016-07-25,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/generic_code_hack_security.png?w=738,"saas,maxcdn,stackpath,security","Security-as-a-service startup StackPath nabs $180M, 4 acquisitions including MaxCDN"
817,Frederic Lardinois,"Google today announced the public beta launch of its Cloud Natural Language API, a new service that gives developers access to Google-powered sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and syntax analysis.
This new API joins Google’s other pre-trained machine-learning APIs like the Cloud Speech API, which is now also available in public beta, the Vision API and the Translate API.
The new Cloud Natural Language API currently supports texts in English, Spanish and Japanese. Google notes that the idea here is to offer a service “that can meet the scale and performance needs of developers and enterprises in a broad range of industries.”
Offering an API for sentiment analysis and entity recognition isn’t new, of course. Services like Thomson Reuters Open Calais have offered support for entity recognition (that is, the ability to automatically identify and label the people, organizations, locations, and events mentioned in text) for almost ten years now, after all. Sentiment analysis, too, isn’t exactly a new concept either.
Syntax analysis APIs that can identify parts of speech and create dependency parse trees, on the other hand, aren’t as widely available yet. It’ll be interesting to see how developers will use them in their apps, but it’s easy to see how this could be used to power chat bots, for example, and help them understand incoming requests.
Pricing for using the Natural Language APIs depends on which one of the three different services you are using and how many records you plan to analyze. Here is Google’s pricing chart:

For the Cloud Speech API, which can recognize over 80 languages, pricing is based on how many minutes of recordings you plan to analyze: the first 60 minutes per month are available for free and after that, you will pay $0.006 per 15 seconds.",2016-07-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/524861124.jpg?w=738,"machine-learning,text-analysis,google-cloud-platform",Google launches new API to help you parse natural language
818,Lora Kolodny,"Dreamit Ventures’ accelerator has ditched the demo day, according to Chief Innovation Officer Steve Barsh. That’s not the only change the early-stage venture firm and accelerator has made of late.
Today, Dreamit unveiled a list of 25 new health and edtech startups launching from its revamped programs. A full list of those companies provided by Dreamit follows at the end of this post.
The accelerator has also shifted its strategy to work with post-seed, but pre-Series A companies instead of fledgling startups still trying to perfect their first product.
Barsh said demo days, which provide a showcase for a group of entrepreneurs from bootcamp-like accelerator programs such as Dreamit’s, aren’t as good for founders and venture investors as people think.
“Everyone can look good in a three minute pitch,” he said. “What investors want is 30 minutes, at least, to poke and prod and dig in deeper with just the companies they’re interested in.”
Instead of demo days, DreamIt has been taking the entrepreneurs in its Health and Education accelerators on roadshows to meet with just the funds that have an interest in what they’re doing.
It also takes them on “customer immersion” roadshows, i.e. to present to executives within organizations who are interested in possibly using their products and services, acquiring them down the line, or partnering with the startups for pilot testing, clinical studies and more.
Those organizations have included Penn State and Penn Medicine, for education and health companies respectively.
These days, Dreamit also structures deals differently than most other accelerators do, meaning it doesn’t offer $50,000 to $100,000 for 6-8% stakes in a business upon admission to its accelerators.
In its most recent Spring 2016 cycle, Dreamit offered most of its companies what it calls a “Zero/Zero offer.” This gives Dreamit the right to invest in up to 25% of a startup’s next round at a 10-20% discount versus other investors.
That model is still evolving as the firm begins to work with more mature, growth-stage companies instead of companies working to get an idea from “cocktail napkin to launch,” Barsh said.
He added, “We feel our offer is actually much more founder-friendly.”
Tech startups who could benefit from time in an industry-specialized accelerator like Dreamit Health or Dreamit Education have had to turn down a chance to participate because their angel investors or cofounders didn’t want them to give away tons of equity for very little capital, Barsh said.
Limited partners in Dreamit’s fund include a mix of institutional investors, endowments, family offices and high net worth individuals. Dreamit’s staff includes 20 full-time with 5 investing partners.
Here are the 25 newest startups to go through Dreamit (descriptions supplied by Dreamit Ventures).

819,Chris Nesi,"German IT services and enterprise giant SAP reported encouraging numbers for Q2 2016, beating analysts’ expectations and spiking its share price by nearly five percent in pre-market trading Wednesday as its non-IFRS EPS increased 2 percent to €0.82 ($0.90). Analysts had predicted a quarterly EPS of $0.78.
The leap is owed in part to the strength of the company’s increasing cloud and software business, for which it reported revenue of (IFRS) €4,359 million ($4,800 million), a 7 percent jump over the year-ago quarter’s figure. Following the news, CEO Bill McDermott enthusiastically reiterated SAP’s guidance for 2016.
“Our groundbreaking new architecture is accelerating momentum across all businesses – cloud, core, and business networks. As a result, SAP delivered a unique trifecta of double digit growth in software, cloud and operating income. Our S/4HANA pipeline has never been stronger and we confidently reiterate our full year guidance,” he said in a statement.
The news builds upon SAP’s last four quarters, each of which beat expectations, and during which time the company saw a healthy uptick in its revenue, particularly in its Cloud and SAP Business Network solutions, the latter of which includes Ariba, Fieldglass, and Concur. The company’s ever-important new cloud bookings also continued to gain momentum, seeing an increase of 28% and reaching €255 million ($280 million).
SAP’s operating profit (IFRS) jumped a whopping 81 percent to €1.27 billion ($1.4 billion), and its Non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue rose 30 percent to €721 million ($794 million). It also announced its in-memory computing platform S/4HANA now has more than 3,700 customers.
Earlier this month, SAP made its first major foray into the steadily emerging Internet of Things business with its acquisition of Norwegian company Fedem Technology AS to boost its capabilities in predictive maintenance, structural integrity monitoring, and other Industry 4.0 applications.
The company has also made significant investments to its cloud portfolio so far this year with the announcement last month of products including SAP HANA smart data integration, SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance, SAP Data Services and SAP HANA smart data quality. It’s also launched SAP Exchange Media and SAP Vehicle Insights.

820,John Mannes,"Etsy users had another bad week as payment processor Worldpay continues to cause problems. Late last week, some Etsy users began reporting that they had experienced duplicate charges. The forum on Etsy for duplicate charges is approaching one thousand posts.
In a statement, Worldpay admitted to causing the duplicate charges for Etsy users in its attempts to rectify the problem.
“Ongoing technical work related to resolving this issue has resulted in a limited number of duplicate charges to Etsy customers.”
Three weeks ago, Etsy merchants began reporting serious payment processing issues. Thousands of posts on Etsy’s bugs forum began pouring in. After a few days, it came to light that Etsy’s payment processor Worldpay was the one directly responsible for the outage.
TechCrunch has also learned that a software update on one of Worldpay’s servers caused the outage. Despite learning more about what caused the outage, we still have no idea how close the company is to processing all of the backlogged payments.
“Unfortunately I can’t quantify progress – understandably, to do so would be take people away from the core effort of resolving the issue,” said an anonymous source close to Worldpay.
We sure hope that Worldpay internally has an idea of their own progress. The company seems to be right on top of the small size of the number of their customers impacted.
“Worldpay is aware of an isolated issue on one of our gateways, resulting in a delay to settlement for a small number of customers,” said Worldpay in response to initial problems reported by Etsy customers.
When you have 15,000 frustrated posts from your customer’s customer, and you’re the one causing the problem, you cannot continue to call the problem small. One percent, Five percent or Ten percent, it’s all a massive amount of money.
These types of outages are common with tech companies but they rarely last more than a few hours or days. Etsy customers have been experiencing delays in processing refunds for weeks.
As time rolls by, the company seems to be slowly getting more proactive, or at least more vocal about it. Yesterday the company made an announcement on its forums that it created a special payments task-force within the company to address lingering issues from customers. The company has issued refunds to buyers and sellers that were charged twice, and asks anyone still affected to write into Etsy Support.
“Affected members will receive an email with more details and should receive a credit for the duplicate payment in three to five days,” said Stephanie Grodin, Director of Payments Product at Etsy. Last week, we instituted a few new processes to improve the resiliency of our platform, and since then new payments have been processing without delays.”
Etsy isn’t the only Worldpay customer getting dragged through the weeds by the payments processor. Taxi services and gambling establishments are getting their share of the madness as well. This is millions of dollars of other people’s money that Worldpay is fumbling with.
At this point, it almost seems irresponsible for Etsy to continue to use Worldpay for processing. Etsy is facing serious competition in the handmade goods e-commerce space and needs as many things to break in its direction as possible as it pushes up against industry giants like Amazon and Ebay. Amazon has already launched Handmade, a service very similar to Etsy, albeit with higher merchant costs.
Etsy has been drastically underperforming since its IPO. Etsy stock has lost over 64 percent of its value from its peak on the first day of trading. Etsy stock is down almost 3.5 percent over the last five trading days. This comes ahead of the company’s second quarter earnings that will be announced in early August.
On the other-side of the table, nobody in the financial world seems to care about Worldpay at the moment. Previously, Worldpay was under the umbrella of the Royal Bank of Scotland. The company was sold off to private equity for a few years and is now publicly traded. Their stock is up three percent over the last five trading days.",2016-07-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/gettyimages-542076705.jpg?w=738,"worldpay,etsy","After 3 weeks, Worldpay still fumbling millions of Etsy transactions"
821,Lora Kolodny,"To predict and prevent fraud online even more quickly than cybercriminals adopt new tactics, Sift Science has raised $30 million in a Series C round of venture funding in a round led by Insight Venture Partners. 
According to the U.S. Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) 2015 annual report, reported internet crimes alone, ranging from personal and corporate data breaches to credit card fraud, phishing and identity, theft cost victims $1.07 billion.
The financial losses to U.S. businesses as a result of such crimes go well beyond what is reported to IC3, of course.
Certain types of sites and apps are under more frequent attacks than others, with digital gift card businesses, money transfer services and on-demand marketplaces rampant with fraud attempts.
Sift Science uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to automatically surmise whether an attempted transaction or interaction with a business online is authentic or potentially problematic.
Sift CEO Jason Tan explained that in an earlier wave of e-commerce, companies relied on rules and rigid systems to flag potential fraudsters. Flagged cases then required a manual review before the company could authorize or deny a purchase, return, redemption of a gift card or other transaction.
Static, rules-based systems leave companies turning down too many good customers and users, but also missing important trends in cybercrime before they strike home, Tan said.
Sift’s machine learning systems constantly track what’s normal behavior online and what is aberrant behavior most strongly correlated with criminal activity. The company’s early clients were mostly involved in retail and e-commerce in the U.S., and wanted to avoid chargebacks that result from fraud.
But Sift now helps protect more than 6,000 websites and apps, including Airbnb, Yelp, Indeed, Zillow, Match.com, Twilio, OpenTable and Wayfair.
One goal that Sift has today, the CEO said, is to make sure that every corner of the internet can remain safe without becoming as annoying and inefficient as an airport’s security checks, from a user experience perspective.
The San Francisco-based company will use its capital to support an expansion beyond retail and e-commerce, and for hiring. Sift currently employs about 60 full-time staffers. It wants to add another 30 employees over the next year, at least.
Today, Sift also launched products aimed at predicting and preventing fraud on sites and apps that are community or content focused, rather than e-commerce and the sales of goods and services. Sift’s products, including the new ones, are SOC Two II certified.
The company competes with massive security companies like RSA and IBM, but also a cadre of startups that use machine learning for fraud prevention, like Riskified, Signifyd and Forter.",2016-07-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/gettyimages-551984543.jpg?w=738,"insight-venture-partners,sift-science,fraud-prevention,cybersecurity",Sift Science raises $30 million to predict and prevent fraud everywhere online
822,"Ingrid Lunden,John Mannes","IT giant IBM has just posted its second quarter earnings, with revenues coming in at $20.24 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share at $2.95. The figures beat analysts’ estimates of $20.03 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $2.89 per share.
However, non-GAAP net income is $2.8 billion, down 25 percent from a year ago (GAAP net income was $2.5 billion, now 29 percent). And although results are showing profit and beating analysts’ estimates, they continue to be in decline. A year ago, IBM reported revenues of $20.81 billion and EPS of $3.84.
Investors seemed pleased with today’s earnings announcement. IBM stock is up almost 3.3 percent or $3.65 to $163.51 per share, in after-hours trading.
While the company is one of the biggest and most iconic in the tech industry, IBM’s legacy business — namely areas like its server hardware and z Systems business — continues to shrink, and this quarter Systems was down more than 23 percent. This is one reason why the company, other big IT players and smaller startups are all putting so much effort and investment into new waves of business.
In the case of Big Blue, that covers just about all kinds of IT under the sun, including emerging areas like blockchain, artificial intelligence and machine learning by way of its Watson division, and a wide array of cloud services, both on its own (as with its video products or security) and in partnership with others like Cisco, which expanded its IBM relationship in recent weeks.
As you can see in the two tables below, the first from the investor presentation and the second from the financial release, while those new areas continue to grow, they are still not enough to offset the other declines:


In terms of Q2 bright spots, cloud services continue to grow and were up 30 percent this quarter and are now at $11.6 billion for the last 12 months running, and accounted for 17 percent of IBM’s revenues in the last quarter. Watson and analytics, security, and social and mobile technologies saw their revenues collectively rise 12 percent, and generated $8.3 billion in sales in the last quarter.
Among other divisions, IBM noted overall declines in several of them:
IBM has been very active in M&A so far in 2016. The company has spent more in the last 12 months on acquisitions than ever before in the history of the company, according to IBM CFO Martin Schroeter. The majority of this quarter’s investments have supported IBM’s growing cognitive solutions business. Data from Truven Health will support Watson Health, while Bluewolf and EZ Source will help bridge cognitive solutions and cloud services with API-management products and consulting services.
During an earnings call, IBM reported that it is going to be enabling Watson for more security applications over the coming months. This is in line with other strategic acquisitions made by the company. IBM acquired Resilient Systems, a company that provides security incident response to a growing repertoire of cybersecurity services.
One interesting note to consider for future quarters is how the situation in Europe, and specifically in the U.K., may impact the company. Today, IBM reported currency impacts that were in the fractions of percentage points in different divisions, but the company counts the U.K. as one of its important international markets, and it’s forecasting that currency declines, for example in the U.K. pound, will impact them in quarters ahead. Other IT companies like HP and Dell have raised their pricing to make up for the currency drop, so it will be worth watching to see how and if IBM follows suit.

824,Nick Johnson,"

With a nearly $18 billion valuation, Snapchat has decided it’s time to make money. The company recently launched a massive expansion of its advertising, including in-stream ads that now play in its Stories feature, as well as an API that will make it much easier for advertisers to buy ads.
Given Snapchat’s aspirations of going public, turning on the money spigot is a necessity. But for a company that prides itself on constantly innovating, Snapchat’s monetization plans are surprisingly unimaginative.
Monetizing via ads comes with a serious downside: There’s a strong negative  network effect between advertisers and Snapchat’s users. The more ads that Snapchat pushes to its users, the less value those users are likely to get out of the platform. Most users find ads to be an annoyance and little else — especially on mobile, where ads take up so much of the screen.
Many would argue that Snapchat has no choice. Other social content platforms like Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram have all monetized via ads. How else can Snapchat hope to make money?
For inspiration, Snapchat should look East. In China, Tencent has built a platform empire that Snapchat should hope to emulate. And, Tencent has done it without relying on ads.
Unlike its Western counterparts, Tencent doesn’t primarily monetize its major platforms ­­– the omnipresent WeChat and its desktop messaging predecessor, QQ — through ads. Instead, it makes the vast majority of its revenue through selling a combination of digital goods (like stickers and digital avatars) and Tencent-owned mobile games.
In fact, by some estimates, Tencent is the largest gaming company in the world. By channeling users through its messaging platforms to these games and digital goods, Tencent is making bank.
How much exactly? In 2015, Tencent kept pace with Facebook, with $15.4 billion in revenue compared to Facebook’s $17.9 billion. And it managed to do that without pushing away or annoying users with an endless stream of advertisements.
Facebook itself tried to jump into the gaming industry back in 2012, just before it went public. But the company bungled the opportunity by allowing developers to constantly spam users with invites to and updates about their games. Anyone who was on Facebook at the time will remember the result: an endless torrent of notifications and News Feed items related to Farmville, Mafia Wars and other freemium games that encouraged their users to spam their friends in order to progress in the game.
Facebook’s developer community died off quickly once the platform moved to stop these kinds of abuses, and it hasn’t really recovered since — even as Facebook has moved to mobile. However, even this short-term experiment with gaming was a huge boon to Facebook’s bottom line. Game-related revenue made up a notable percentage of the company’s revenue as it went public, with one gaming company, Zynga, accounting for 12 percent of the company’s annual revenue at the time of its IPO.
Snapchat has the chance to succeed where Facebook failed.
The company already has a number of augmented reality (AR) features built into its app, including the hugely popular face-swap feature, as well as other AR imaging features like fake mustaches, masks and dog ears that overlay your face as you take a photo or record a video.
But as the mega-phenomenon of Pokémon Go has shown, AR has the potential to go much further. While Snapchat’s filters let you play with your world, the Pokémon game encourages users to get outside and explore the world around them and experience it in new ways.
I would know — on my journey to becoming the world’s first Pokémon Go “master” who caught every Pokémon currently available in the United States, I walked an average of 8 miles a day. I explored areas of Brooklyn, Manhattan and New Jersey I never would have visited otherwise. And I met hundreds of people and made new friends that I never would have met if not for the game.
As the social platform of the millennial generation, Snapchat can do this and more. That’s why it’s time for Snapchat to go beyond the novelty factor of mustaches and dog ears and embrace the potential of AR gaming to change the way we interact with the real world and each other.
As Tencent has shown in China, the revenue potential is there. Yet the U.S. is a very different market than China, and the path of monetizing via ads is tried and true. For a company likely to go public in the near future, the appeal of quickly building up its advertising revenue is obvious. But if Snapchat takes the leap, like Tencent in China, it has the ability to build a platform empire that would rival Facebook’s.
Today, Snapchat is already the lens through which its users share experiences with each other. Now it can become the lens through which its users experience the world.",2016-08-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/snapchat-pikachu-50.jpg?w=738,"tencent,monetization,advertising",Advice for Snapchat from the world’s first Pokémon Go master
825,Anthony Ha,"140 Proof, a company that helps advertisers target their campaigns based on social data, has been acquired by AcuityAds for up to $20 million in cash.
140 Proof co-founder and CEO Jon Elvekrog said the deal will combine his company’s strength in social media with AcuityAds’ programmatic ad-buying tech.
The 140 Proof brand and team will continue to exist within AcuityAds, Elvekrog said. He also said he’ll be joining the larger company, along with his co-founder/CTO John Manoogian III and their entire 20-person team.
When I asked about the direction of the broader social advertising and analytics market, Elvekrog and Manoogian argued that 140 Proof stands out because of its efforts to build an “interest graph” based on people’s social connections, not just the content that they’re posting.

140 Proof had raised $5.5 million in funding from investors including BlueRun Ventures, Founders Fund and SV Angel. AcuityAds, meanwhile, went public in Canada back in 2014.

826,Devin Coldewey,"As you may have noticed over the last few days — I sure did — Facebook recently incorporated a sneaky change to the way its ads are displayed that disguised them as ordinary content and circumvented ad blocking software in browsers. Ads crowded the streams of even the most vigilant users.  But this hell on earth was not to last: two days and change later, the Adblock Plus community has found a way to block them again.
On Tuesday, when Facebook implemented the change, Adblock Plus was philosophical about it. This wasn’t the end of an era, but perhaps the start of one: “If nothing else, all this attention from Facebook shows that ad blocking has finally made the big time.”
A global community of staunchly anti-advertising coders and hackers is a great base to call on in such a situation, and they delivered.
If you use AdBlock Plus, it should update itself automatically, or you can add the filter yourself. ABP is the most popular blocker, but because the code was added to Easylist, a compendium of such filters used by many pieces of ad-blocking software, you can also expect to see the ads disappear if you use uBlock, Adguard, and others.
“We promised that the open source community would have a solution very soon, and, frankly, they’ve beaten even our own expectations,” the company wrote in a blog post. But it also tempered its enthusiasm by noting that this was no great victory, just another day for proponents of ad-blocking.

“This sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented,” the post reads. “So it’s very possible that Facebook will write some code that will render the filter useless — at any time. If that happens, the ad-blocking community will likely find another workaround, then Facebook might circumvent again, etc.”
Sure enough, after this article was published, a Facebook spokesperson emailed TechCrunch regarding the counter-block to say “we plan to address the issue.”

Some feel ad blocking is akin to stealing from the websites and services you visit. Some think it’s entirely up to the user to decide what content they see and how. Some argue that online advertising is so poor and ineffective that there’s no point using it at all. Some say the ad blockers themselves are running a racket. Some want ads to be relevant to themselves, so they block generalized ads — and some fear targeting, and so only want generalized ads!
There are plenty of perspectives to be examined, though here isn’t really the place. The reality is that the technology to block ads is widely and freely available and millions are taking advantage of it to create what is unarguably a better web experience. They’re going to keep doing that, and companies that rely on advertising must accept that as a given — and hopefully find some way to make money that doesn’t adversely affect the product they offer.",2016-08-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/adblocking.jpg?w=738,"adblock-plus,advertising",Facebook’s blocker-blocking ads blocked by blockers
827,Josh Constine,"News outlets may get back some of their mojo stolen by a June Facebook feed algorithm change that preferred friends over publishers. Today Facebook will start predicting stories that are informative and highlighting them to people if they’re “related to their interests, if they engage people in broader discussions, and if they contain news”.
Facebook surveyed tons of people about what feed stories they found informative. It concluded these were the qualities that made people perceive a post that way. It then built a personalized News Feed model to boost future stories that share commonalities with the well-rated ones and match what users already engage with.
“This could be a news article on a current event” Facebook writes. But since everyone has a subjective view of what’s informative, it could also be “a story about your favorite celebrity, a piece of local news, a review of an upcoming movie, a recipe, or anything that informs you.”
Facebook tells me this isn’t a drastic change, and is more about reordering stories already good enough to appear high in your feed than it is about injecting or banishing certain stories. The company writes, “We anticipate that most Pages won’t see any significant changes to their distribution in News Feed. Some Pages might see a small increase in referral traffic, and some Pages might see minor decreases.”
The move might quell some fears of publishers that inane content from your friends would appear higher than important news articles. They’re still assessing the impact of the major “friends and family first” feed change from two months ago. However, anecdotally, some users report a noticeable decline in publishers’ posts in their feeds.
Facebook’s blog post announcing today’s update is a bit vague, but I pushed the company for details about how it built this new predictive model.
First it administered crowdsourced surveys and its Feed Quality Program where it asks users to rank the stories they see by how relevant, entertaining, and informative they are on a scale of 1 (really not informative) to 5 (really informative). It took posts with 4s and 5s on informativeness and fed them into its predictive model to teach it what to look for.

That model is then personalized for each user based on their relationship to a post’s author, how often they comment on posts with already-active comment reels, and what kinds of posts they typically click. All these signals are combined with the existing machine learning algorithms Facebook uses to scan the content of posts you engage with to identify topics they care about.
The News Feed uses that model to scan all the possible stories they could see. Posts that it predicts will be personally informative then get more visibility.
Facebook tells that since everyone thinks what’s informative is different, the change won’t necessarily increase news visibility across the board. Still, similar to Facebook’s recent announcement that it will bypass web ad blockers — something publishers hate — today’s update could improve Facebook’s relationship with the news industry. Those who do care about news might see more of it.
Detailing each of these News Feed changes might stir up concern amongst businesses that depend on it for referral traffic. But that beats the constant sneaking suspicion that Facebook is secretly changing the feed’s laws of physics like it used to.",2016-08-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/facebook-news-feed-still.png?w=738,facebook-news-feed,Facebook feed change that predicts what’s informative could reprioritize news
828,Josh Constine,"Facebook has to train people how to make great video if it wants it “at the heart” of its services like Mark Zuckerberg promised, so today it launched a slew of new video analytics. Creators can now see the audience demographics of their video viewers, what moments were most engaging in their live broadcasts, and how shares and cross-posts boosted their view counts.
 
But more interesting is the pioneering work Facebook is doing around bringing narrative to the 360 video experience. In the 250,000 360 videos uploaded to Facebook so far, viewers always had to choose for themselves where to look, but creators couldn’t tell what angles were the most eye-catching. Two new features fix that.
Guide lets 360 video makers set a default path for the viewing window to move through in order to create a lean-back experience. When uploading a 360 video, the new 360 Controls tab lets producers “Enable Guide” and then select points in the video they want people to see. When users watch, the viewing window will default to automatically move around the 360 video sphere and focus on the selected spots.

This way, creators can tell a story without worrying that viewers will miss the important parts, like “a diver plunging into the water or a shark swimming up behind them”, Facebook writes. And viewers can swipe out of the Guide to choose where they look, and tap the Guide button again to return to the director’s track.
You can see the 360 Guide in action on these videos, including the New York Times’ recording of Usain Bolt’s world record 100 meter sprint, and ABC News’ cruise through New York Harbor
Heatmap allows video creators to see where people looked inside their 360 video. A visual map shows the most viewed angles by measuring whenever viewers moves more than 30 degrees.

Heatmap will be available on all videos with over 50,000 unique viewers from late-April onward, and can be found in the Video Library’s Publishing Tools for each video. Creators can use Heatmap to inform what points of a video they want in their Guide
Facebook is building a bigger and bigger lead in 360 social video by developing these technologies. While YouTube also has 360 playback, Twitter and Snapchat lack it. Zuckerberg has repeatedly said he sees Facebook evolving from text and photos to videos and 360 content. But with any new medium, creators are still figuring out what works. These new analytics could push 360 video from the “Train Pulling Into The Station” demo phase into an age of real artistry.",2016-08-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/facebook-360-video1.gif?w=680,,Facebook’s 360 video Guide and Heatmap can steer or track where you look
829,Sarah Perez,"Sending a letter to the White House is getting a digital upgrade today. In addition to accepting hand-written missives by postal mail and emails, the public can now send a note to President Obama via Facebook. On the the White House’s Facebook page, you can use Messenger to “speak” to the administration by way of the newly launched White House Messenger bot.
To use the bot, you first click on “Message” on the White House page, then click “Get Started” in the Messenger window that appears. The bot greets you, mentioning also as a “fun fact” that the President reads 10 of these messages every night.
That doesn’t necessarily mean he’s reading 10 Facebook messages, however. As the White House’s Chief Digital Officer Jason Goldman points out in the announcement about the new bot, President Obama reads 10 letters from citizen every night as part of a daily routine designed to keep him in touch with American citizens. This include those sent via postal mail.
The White House has been reading letters from the public since the tradition began with Thomas Jefferson, Goldman notes. But as new technology has emerged, it expanded the way the public can connect. For instance, the White House began taking phone calls in the 1880s, and it introduced a way for people to submit messages online through WhiteHouse.gov in 1994.

After the bot’s initial greeting, it prompts you to click on “Let’s go!” and then asks you what you would like to say to President Obama. From there, you simply write your message in Messenger, just as if you were writing a friend. After you send it, the bot asks if that’s your whole message, to which you can respond “Yes” or “No.” When you click “Yes,” it even gives you a chance to check your typos before the message goes through.
However, to cut down on the spam and other random messages, the bot does ask for your contact information before sending your note, including your U.S. mailing address, email, and phone number. Collecting your personal data like this should help deter people who have threatening messages from using the new system.
“Our goal is to meet people where they are. It’s why the President launched his own Twitter account and the First Lady is on Snapchat,” writes Goldman. “It’s about creating opportunities for people to engage with their government in new and accessible ways, using the same technologies we already rely on in our daily lives.”
The White House’s Messenger bot is the first of its kind for any government, he also adds.
While some of the implementations of Facebook’s Messenger bots have left a lot to be desired in terms of user experience and usefulness, this is one example of the platform’s potential for practical matters. It could also potentially pave the way for other politicians to connect with the public in a similar fashion.

830,Ingrid Lunden,"As LinkedIn inches closer to completing its $26 billion acquisition by Microsoft, smaller rivals have stepped up their game building viable alternatives for those who might want more independent products when it comes to managing contacts in their professional networks. FullContact — one such competitor — has now raised a further $25 million.
The funding brings the total raised by Denver-based FullContact to just under $45 million. FullContact’s co-founder and CEO Bart Lorang said the company is not disclosing its valuation.
The big elephant in the room for FullContact is LinkedIn. Fast approaching 450 million users, the company is one of the bigger players in the area of online professional identity and has become the go-to place for people looking to connect with people in their professional networks. On its own it was already a competitive threat, and its acquisition by Microsoft may be even more so, as it speaks to the bigger company’s ambitions to leverage LinkedIn’s social networking in its own enterprise-focused products, from sales through to productivity services.
But rather than wilting under the obvious challenges that this poses to FullContact and others in the space, FullContact’s CEO has a more constructive view on the deal and what it means for his startup.
“The LinkedIn acquisition demonstrates the power of the single ID and a unified contact record in the ecosystem,” Lorang said in an interview.
The key thing for him is that Microsoft remains a proprietary platform, and LinkedIn has not demonstrated itself to be particularly happy to share its data with the rest of that ecosystem, either. “FullContact’s strategy is to create an open platform that is owned by humanity. We allow and invite developers to integrate with our platform, unlike LinkedIn. It has been rather closed off. They very much want to build a wall,” he added a little mischievously, borrowing a phrase more commonly (and controversially) associated with something and someone else. 
Led by Foundry Group with participation from Baird Capital, Shea Ventures and Blue Note, FullContact’s latest round will be used for acquisition — “I see a lot of distressed startups out there in our wider field unable to raise more money for sure,” said Lorang; and also hiring, business development, and adding in new features that will expand FullContact beyond contact management and into new areas.
One of those new features, Lorang said, sounds like a way to use your contact information in FullContact’s database as an identity card across the wider web.
“We have quietly been working on FullContact Connect, our next-generation platform capabilities where you will have your own ID, your own contact record, and you can use it to consume and control content online,” he said. “We are working on that. We do have ambitions.”
Founded in 2010 in Denver (where it is still based), FullContact has built itself out as one of a group of companies that is trying to tackle the issue of managing contacts that you make through your normal business life, as well as growing that list through intelligent searches based on the people you already know, and turning piecemeal contact info into more complete profiles.
The company has its own primary data that it augments with data from across the web, and using algorithms — both built in-house and also picked up by way of acquisition of competitors like Brewster — it merges all of it to create a database of some 40 billion contacts that its users can access. (FullContact does not disclose its actual user numbers, except to say that they are in the ‘millions.’)
FullContact today makes revenues from three categories of customers: individuals, businesses and software developers. It taps the first of these groups via freemium-style iPhone and Android apps that let you do things like scan and digitize business cards and then augment that information with more data about those people.
Meanwhile, the business and developer solutions let third parties tap into FullContact’s database by way of APIs to help create more complete customer profiles. The latter of these is a smart area for the company to develop to pick up developers and others who found themselves in a lurch when LinkedIn shut down similar API functionality in 2015.
Ironically, while FullContact has built its business on the concept of being able to enhance contact information, another area where Lorang also agreed it might move in years ahead might be in helping manage that info for those who don’t want it out in the open.
This is a trend that we see picking up some speed with the recent surge in interest in online privacy and data protection. For example, in Europe, you have the “right to be forgotten” development, where Google and other search engines are required to remove search links on people’s names when requested to do so by those individuals.
“I love the trend of being more transparent,” said Lorang. While Lorang said you can already claim and manage a profile on FullContact, it’s now working on ways of expanding that to other data repositories. “We are just starting to roll out that type of capability to remove yourself,” he said. “You’ll see more from us on this in the next year.”
For now, FullContact and its investors are happy to keep the startup in Denver and well outside the Valley bubble to grow. 
“With over 40 billion contact records under management, FullContact was already on track to more than double recurring revenue for the fourth straight year,” said Brad Feld, MD of the Foundry Group, in a statement. “The funding will be used to support the company’s rapid growth by further expanding sales, marketing and engineering as well as pursuing strategic acquisitions that bolster our technology and data assets.”",2016-08-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/3122900531_8d3883f542_b.jpg?w=738,"baird-capital,foundry-group,fullcontact",FullContact raises $25M more to take on LinkedIn in contact management
831,Josh Constine,"Facebook is making the HTML of its web ads indistinguishable from organic content so it can slip by adblockers. But in exchange for taking away this option for controlling ads from people, its allowing them to opt-out of ad targeting categories and Custom Audience customer lists uploaded by advertisers. Today all desktop users will see an announcement atop the News Feed explaining that while web adblockers may no longer work, they can visit their Ad Preferences settings to block ads from particular businesses.

Facebook commissioned research firm Ipsos to investigate why reports say 70 million Americans and nearly 200 million people worldwide use adblockers. It found that “The main reasons cited for using ad blockers include avoiding disruptive ads (69%), ads that slow down their browsing experience (58%) and security / malware risks (56%).” Privacy wasn’t the top answer. So Facebook thinks if its can make its ads non-interruptive, fast, and secure, people won’t mind.
The rationale for the change, according to Facebook’s VP of ads Andrew Bosworth, is that “Part of the mission of the company is to create connections between people and businesses”, which adblockers prevent. At the same time, Boz says “Ads on Facebook don’t pay for Facebook for one person. They pay for a service that’s free around the world. The participation of everyone really helps the global community.”
Importantly, Facebook refused to pay the ransom most adblocking software companies are willing to accept to whitelist certain sites and keep showing their ads.
Instead, since it serves and measures its own ads rather than using third-parties that leave traces adblockers can spot, it could hide the evidence. Adblockers would have to snoop the JavaScript or actual content shown by Facebook to detect and remove ads, which would significantly slow down load times. Facebook is betting users would rather just endure the ads. Bosworth tells me “I think the alternatives for adblockers would be very deleterious to the user experience”.
[Update: Adblock Plus, the leading adblocking company, responded to Facebook’s action with a blog post entitled “Oh well, looks like Facebook just got all anti-user”, which says ”
AdBlock Plus’ response ignores the part where Facebook gave users more power to select which ads they see. Its mention of “cat-and-mouse games” implies it may still try to work around Facebook’s new adblocker blocker.]

Boz admits that the advertising industry needs to improve in the way ads are delivered such that they don’t bog down sites, but says “I don’t think adblockers are a very good solution. They specifically don’t serve publishers will, who deserve to be compensated for their content. But they don’t serve customers well either. The adblockers take money for showing ads, which mean they don’t have the consumers’ best interest in mind.”
Facebook’s updated Ad Preferences let users pick and choose which ads to hide rather than blanket-blocking them all. People can see the interests like hiking or automobiles that Facebook has categorized them with, the Pages they’ve Liked, and the advertisers who’ve uploaded their contact information or web browsing patterns to Facebook, and then opt out of that targeting.

But rapidly clicking to hide all these sources won’t make you see fewer ads, they’ll just be less targeted and relevant. While some people might not want to accept it, Facebook needs that ad revenue to run the servers that save their photos and the pay the teams that build products like News Feed they enjoy.
If you’re going to see ads, they may as well be for things you might want to buy. Sure, ads can be annoying, but I’ve also discovered concert tickets and clothing through Facebook ads that I wouldn’t have otherwise known about.
By unblocking ads, Facebook could boost its already impressive revenues. It earned $6.2 billion on ads last quarter. While some hardcore adblock fans might grumble, they’ll have to either accept seeing ads, or miss out on the service Facebook provides.
Inevitably, some people will ask “Why can’t I just pay a monthly fee to not see ads on Facebook?” Mark Zuckerberg has promised Facebook will always stay free. But if it did, surely some users in the developing world wouldn’t be able to afford it.
Advertising is the lifeblood of the consumer internet. Services like Google couldn’t organize the world’s information and Facebook couldn’t provide ways to stay in touch with distant family to everyone if they didn’t have ad revenue.
So while the ads industry could be more respectful of its audience, advertising itself makes services free that some people need but could never buy. That makes adblockers a selfish choice when their are more cooperative alternatives to controlling what you see online.",2016-08-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/facebook-ad-preferences.png?w=738,,"Facebook will bypass web adblockers, but offer ad targeting opt-outs"

833,Jordan Crook,"The media industry is changing rapidly, and publications are forced to adapt accordingly. That’s where Spectrm, a new Berlin-based startup, comes into play. Spectrm bets big on bots, delivering news content via messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, Slack, and Telegram on behalf of publishers.
Since launch in the summer of 2015, Spectrm has been able to give unique insights to publishing partners, like the fact that content consumers are more likely to engage with content in the middle of the day as opposed to the morning or evening.
Publishers who opt in to the Spectrm experience don’t need any coding experience to start distributing content. Instead, Spectrm offers a CMS interface, letting publishers customize their content for messaging. This includes the ability to add GIFs, videos, and other rich media.
From there, Spectrm’s technology is able to have a conversation with the user, both via responses from the user and their click behavior, to continue serving relevant content at the right time.
Spectrm lets brands market the feature to their own audiences — users can direct message the publisher’s Facebook page, or publishers can add a subscribe button on their own sites.
As you might expect, Spectrm operates under a SaaS model, with publishers paying a base fee of $195/month for access to the platform.
The company is currently in business with more than 50 publishers, including Business Insider, NowThis and German publisher Bild.
There are plenty of products out there that help publishers automate and customize the way their content is shared via social networks, but none have served up tools that suit the more intimate messaging space.
Spectrm has raised a total of $1.5 million from North Base Media, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Axel Springer, BDMI and German angel investor Jens Schumann.",2016-08-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/spectrm-implementation.png?w=738,,Berlin-based Spectrm delivers the news via Facebook Messenger
834,Sarah Perez,"NBCUniversal is expanding its relationship with social networking platform Snapchat, according to an announcement out this morning detailing a new content and advertising partnership between the two companies. The deal will see the media and entertainment brand developing mobile, short-form versions of several of its popular shows, including NBC’s “The Voice” and E! News’ “The Rundown,” for starters. Original Snapchat shows from “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” and “Saturday Night Live” will follow, among others.
The idea, explains NBCUniversal, is to reimagine its TV franchises for Snapchat and a mobile-first audience. However, the new shows are not simply video summaries or clips of what’s airing on television – they will feature original content.
For example, “The Voice on Snapchat” will include judges Miley Cyrus, Alicia Keys, Adam Levine and Blake Shelton and will showcase user-submitted performance videos which prospective talent can submit via voicesnaps.com. The coaches will review the clips and a winner will have the opportunity to appear on the show’s new season, beginning September 19. This will be the first-ever reality competition to expand to Snapchat, NBCUniversal notes.
“The Voice on Snapchat,” a five-part, short-form series, is the first of the new originals to arrive, debuting on Monday, August 22nd.
E! News will debut its pop culture news show “The Rundown” on Snapchat on September 8th, which will also feature exclusive content that can only be seen on the social networking service.
As a part of this multi-year deal, NBCUniversal says it will sell ad products that incorporate Snapchat’s ads in its sponsorship, mobile and video offerings.
“NBCUniversal is committed to tapping into its talent, resources and reach to be the leader in delivering mobile-first premium content,” said Ron Lamprecht, EVP Business Development and Digital Distribution, NBCUniversal, in a statement. “From entertainment to news and sports, NBCUniversal has an unparalleled lineup and Snapchat is the perfect partner to help us reach millions of fans where they are every day.”
NBCUniversal and Snapchat were already working together on other channels, including a first-of-its-kind deal that features content from the Rio Olympics. Through a dedicated channel in the app, Olympics content includes daily “Live Stories” from the network, fans and athletes. BuzzFeed, which NBCUniversal invested $200 million in last year, is also involved in producing this Olympics content for Snapchat.
In addition to the shows listed above, NBCUniversal says other programming from its portfolio will be coming to Snapchat in the future as well, including those from other entertainment, news, sports and Hispanic brands.",2016-08-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/thevoice-ipad-1600x900-ko.jpg?w=640,"snaps,tv,nbcuniversal",NBCUniversal is bringing mini TV shows to Snapchat
835,,"Below is an excerpt fromNeon Fever Dream by Eliot Peper. Neon Fever Dream is about a dark secret hidden in the swirling dust and exultant revelry of Burning Man. It’s a fast-paced thriller with a diverse cast that weaves together everything from the ripple effects of the Sri Lankan civil war to the impacts of new technology on international organized crime.
I chose this excerpt because it weaves together the most important elements of the story: international intrigue based on real-world issues, psychological thrills with lots of personal twists/turns/lessons-learned, and unique Burning Man setting.
Bass reverberated through Asha’s body, and she let the rhythm guide her movements. DJ Xenn stood on a three-story platform, head tilted to press the headphone against his shoulder as he nodded ever so slightly along with the beat. Smaller stages stood to either side, the backlit shadows of naked dancers spinning and entwining on massive canvas screens. The crowd surged with the electronic crescendo, hundreds of wildly costumed people moving as one.
Lynn grabbed Asha’s hand and spun her. Asha leaned backward as she came around and slid an arm behind Lynn’s back. Derek, Marlon, and the Vikings cheered the move, and one passed a plastic bottle filled with more champagne. Asha took a swig—the dust had parched her throat, and she welcomed the sparkling relief. Handing the bottle off to Lynn, she let the trumpets carry her into a series of whirling dance moves.
Grids of multicolored lasers skewered the floating particles of dust and blasted into the night sky, perfectly synchronized with the music. A Mayan warrior emerged from the throng in front of her, gold and copper bangles scattering light in all directions. His movements were as graceful as a professional dancer and oversize pink sunglasses softened his angular face. Melodic undertones began to build on top of the synth beat. A beautiful girl with a short Afro in an olive jumpsuit unzipped to the navel swung a combat-booted leg over his thigh, and their movements became one with each other and the music. The crowd parted, and the couple’s movements mesmerized and inflamed Asha.
DJ Xenn held a hand in the air, and the song reached for a climax along with him. The track crested like a tsunami, and the massive flamethrowers surrounding the circular dance floor belched seven-meter pillars of fire straight up at the stars. Heat rippled out over the dancers, and the couple’s lips met in a long, extended kiss that broke only when the girl pushed off the Mayan’s chest and spun away to disappear into the crowd.
Asha turned to find Lynn biting her lip and staring back. Those gold and emerald eyes were hypnotizing. Supreme confidence and desperate loneliness wrestled in their depths. Cinnamon and smoke.
“Come on,” said Asha. “Let’s get out of here.”
The set was over. DJ Xenn spun a chill-out track and descended from the throne. The crowd milled and migrated toward the exit. They lost Marlon and the Vikings in the hubbub but didn’t bother finding them. Once Lynn and Asha had made their way out of Green Ocean and located their bikes, they started pedaling back to Camp Wino.
The chilly night air whisked away Asha’s sweat and raised goose bumps on her arms. The glittering intoxication of the champagne waxed philosophical. Asha remembered cool evenings on the plantation, crickets chirping, tea leaves rustling, secrets exchanged. This was the thrill. This was the adventure she had been aching for. This was the pearl hidden in the oyster of life that her parents had never found.
“On the drive in,” said Asha as they rode side by side across the dark desert, “you mentioned that you did some reporting on the Tamil Tigers.”
“Yes,” said Lynn. The wind and dust had subsided, and they were able to ride barefaced. “Beijing was quietly sending financial and military aid to the government as they prepared for the final offensive campaign.”
“Have you heard of the Karuna Faction?” Something cracked in Asha’s tone, like the first fault line to give way in an impending earthquake.
Lynn shook her head.
The leader of the Tigers had a falling out with his top commander and bodyguard, Colonel Karuna,” said Asha. “Karuna split off and formed an independent militia and then allied himself with the government. The government used them as a black ops unit, giving politicians deniability for messy wetwork. They disappeared political opponents and Tamils from all over the country, often demanding ransoms from expatriate family members as a fundraising mechanism. But I didn’t find out any of this stuff until after.”
“After what?”
Asha sucked in a breath. Her pulse was racing. She hadn’t ever told anyone about this besides Dov. She kept it locked away deep inside, but for some strange reason, she wanted to tell Lynn. It felt right to have it come out under a dome of brilliant stars in a place that felt apart from the world.
“My parents are Sinhalese, not Tamil,” said Asha. “And despite the fact that their tea plantation makes them leaders in the local community, they’ve always avoided politics. They focus on the people they can talk to, see, and touch, not on ideological abstraction. So when the government started disappearing people in Colombo and Tamils started fleeing for the countryside, my parents quietly offered food, water, and sanctuary to the most desperate.”
The night took on a silvery sheen, and Asha felt light as a feather. “Once, they even fostered a young boy, Rakash, whose parents had been killed. I was five years old, and he lived with us for about a year. I was delighted to have someone my own age to play with on the estate. He was like a brother to me, and we were masters of hide-and-go-seek. But my parents didn’t go to great lengths to hide their charity, and eventually word got out. Some elements in the Colombo power structure felt they were sympathizing with the enemy and undermining the government’s terror campaign against the Tigers, who were, if anything, even worse.”
“The memories were buttoned up so tight that releasing them felt at once sacrosanct and sacrilegious. Asha glanced over and saw that Lynn’s face was tight, tiny lines forming at the corners of her eyes. “One night, after I had just turned six, five Karuna men showed up at the house. My dad hid me when he saw their truck coming up the drive. They beat him and my mom.” Dizziness rendered Burning Man’s neon midnight horizon dazzling. “Then they executed Rakash.” Something halfway between a gasp and a sigh escaped from Asha. “They were laughing as they drove away. It was all a big joke to them. Just another day’s work.”
The words hung in the air between them as if branded in fiery script. They smoldered and morphed in the ensuing silence, taking on texture and weight. Asha was surprised to find that the admission made her feel more free than vulnerable. Secrets lost their power when shared.
“Asha, I’m sorry,” said Lynn. “I’m so sorry.” There was a foundation of gravitas under the words that made their stark simplicity more impactful. They came from the heart, a heart that knew pain.
“I’ll meet you back at camp,” said Asha. “I need a bathroom break.”
“I’ll go with you,” said Lynn, concern written all over her face.
“No really, I’ll be okay.” She wanted a moment alone to pull herself together.
Asha parked her bike and found a vacant unit in the long line of porta-potties abutting the street. She had expected them to be disgusting, but they were serviced multiple times per day and by porta-potty standards, things could be a lot worse. Regardless, she was glad she had a respirator.
She closed the latch and peed. The EL wire stitched into her jumpsuit emitted psychedelic patterns of light that made the graffiti inscribed on every available surface roil and swirl. The hard walls of reality softened, revealing themselves to be nothing but permeable membranes. Her jaw opened and closed reflexively, and her tongue explored every corner of her mouth. Her heart rate accelerated, and her breath was hot, wet, and stale inside the respirator.
It wasn’t a porta-potty. It was a closet. Light bled through the keyhole. Asha knew she shouldn’t look. No good could come from it. But dark curiosity metastasized into inexorable compulsion. It would not be denied. She didn’t stand much higher than the doorknob, so she barely had to bend over to glue her eye to the keyhole, vipers tangling in her gut.
Her mother screamed before one of the men backhanded her across the face, knocking her unconscious when she hit the floor. Her father argued, then begged, then pleaded. But the men hadn’t come for words. They were not the kind of people who afforded words much weight. They tore off his shirt and beat him to within an inch of his life.
Once they were finished with him, they abandoned him on the floor and hustled out through the back door, smashing things as they went. She heard them on the veranda. Laughing. Talking. Taunting. The gunshot snapped her body to attention. She bit her tongue and tasted blood as it echoed out over the tea fields. More laughing. Then an engine rumbling off into the night.
She didn’t know how long she stayed in that closet. Finally, her father managed to pull himself over to her mother, checking her heartbeat and breathing with his broken hands. Ever so gently, he lifted her to the couch and then stumbled over to the closet, blood and mucus turning his face into a nightmare mask. Fear and confusion hummed at a high voltage inside Asha. This wasn’t how the world worked. Her father ran the estate. He was a gentle and well-liked leader within Haputale. People looked up to him. People respected him. The closet door opened, and he hugged her close, sobs wracking his body. His pants were warm and damp against her cheek. Eww. He had peed himself. Adults weren’t supposed to wet their pants. She pulled away, trying to escape. Gross, Thaaththi, you peed your pants. Although he reacted with a sad smile, she would never forgive herself for uttering those words.”
You cannot control the world, but only you control how you react to it. Asha squeezed her eyes shut and shot out a hand. The plastic was smooth and cool beneath her palm. The reek of urine was coming from the porta-potty, not childhood ghosts. She was at Burning Man, taking a pit stop on the way home from a dance party. Haputale was a world away. Pushing her goggles up on her forehead, she swiped away the tears and stood.
She walked her bike the rest of the way back to Camp Wino, letting her breathing and thoughts settle back into some semblance of normal. Locking it on the rack, she ducked under the canvas sheeting and stepped up into the van.”
Lynn was lying on top of her sleeping bag, still fully clothed, reading a tattered paperback with a flashlight. Need welled up within Asha like lava bubbling to the brim of a volcano. Enough games. She knelt onto the mattress, gently pushed the book away, and slid a hand into one of the slits in Lynn’s leather costume to explore the flesh beneath. Lynn sucked in a breath, and her pupils dilated. Desire transformed from alluring to imperative. Asha leaned forward, and their lips met for the second time.
What I want is to live my own life. The rest of the world could go fuck themselves.

836,Sarah Perez,"The team from a startup called Eyegroove, a “musical selfie” app, has joined Facebook. According to a message on the company’s website, most of the small team who worked on the app will now be focused on building new experiences for Facebook users that will help them to “create, share and connect.”
Founded in late 2013, the Eyegroove application was the brainchild of Scott Snibbe, an interactive media artist who worked on Bjork’s Biophilia app, acquired by MoMA. Eyegroove was aimed at helping users make their own, high-quality videos using their smartphone. As Snibbe explained in a 2014 interview, the idea behind Eyegroove was to be an “Instagram for interactive music.”
Launched to the public a couple of years ago, Eyegroove worked with SoundCloud, allowing users to make 19-second videos for any of the songs on SoundCloud’s service. It offered a social networking component, as well, where users could share their “Grooves,” as these videos were called. These Grooves could include special effects like a kaleidoscopic view, for example, or other video filters.
However, in the years since its launch, Eyegroove was overshadowed by other social video apps, including Dubsmash and Musical.ly, the latter which recently raised a whopping $100 million at a $500 million valuation. Meanwhile, Eyegroove failed to get traction.
Its last ranking on the iTunes App Store before being removed was in the low 500’s within the “Music & Video” category, according to data from App Annie. It wasn’t ranked on any other charts. Sensor Tower estimates it to have around 250,000 downloads.
Eyegroove was backed by $3.5 million in seed funding from a range of angel investors, including Matt Papakipos, Roger McNamee, Amarjit Gil, and Bill McLean, as reported by CrunchBase and on the Eyegroove website.
While the team is joining Facebook, we understand that this is more of an acqui-hire – Facebook did not buy the company, the tech or IP. It’s more about bringing in talent who can help with the development of more creative tools on the site, but not necessarily those that would be a direct answer to Musical.ly.
The move – which took place within the last week – comes at a time when Facebook is ramping up its efforts in the video space, with Facebook Live, its Periscope competitor, and integrations between its acquisition MSQRD and the social network itself, announced earlier today.
A note from Snibbe on the startup’s website explains that the app is shutting down, and thanked its users for the “amazing community.” It also confirms that much of the team is joining Facebook.

The startup had a small team of under a dozen according to AngelList and LinkedIn. (No one has yet to update their LinkedIn profiles to indicate they’re now at Facebook.) Along with the Eyegroove team, founder Scott Snibbe is also going to Facebook.
Emails to Snibbe were not returned. Other messages to the Eyegroove domain bounced. Facebook declined to comment.",2016-08-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/eyegroove.jpg?w=738,,"Facebook snatches up team from Eyegroove, a musical selfie app"
837,Darrell Etherington,"Tumbled glass has a definite appeal: It’s eye-catching, has a pleasant variety of colors, and feels nice in the hand. And making it just takes time, and repetitive motion – throw some glass in a rock tumbler for about a week and voila – what comes out is better than what came in. But it’s also ultimately just glass.
The social apps we use every day are starting to look a lot like tumbled glass.
If you subscribe to the notion that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, this past week has made Facebook the sincerest technology company in existence, and Snapchat the most flattered.
On Tuesday, Instagram launched Stories, which didn’t even bother changing the name of the product it was copying, Snapchat Stories. Facebook-owned Instagram wasn’t shy about the similarity, either: Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom freely gave Snapchat credit for the concept, which if you’re out of the social loop, involves letting users post photos and videos strung together in a “story” that expires after 24 hours.
Then, on Friday, Facebook proper began testing an experiment whereby the mobile app opens directly to a camera window atop a user’s feed, which makes use of Facebook acquisition MSQRD’s selfie filters for an Olympics tie-in. Sure, it’s a special case tied to a specific event, and available only in Brazil (makes sense, Olympics are there) and Canada. Canada is the more interesting component, because the great white north is normally where companies run tests ahead of big U.S. rollouts, since the market is so similar but low-risk due to its much smaller size.

Opening direct to a camera definitely drives that kind of engagement, especially with younger audiences. We know that because that’s how Snapchat works. Which is where Facebook got this idea. In an interview with The Verge, FB product manager Sachin Monga explained it’s designed to give everyday users “this magical AR experience.” It’s no Systrom-style shoutout, but Snapchat is widely regarded as pioneering broad consumer use of augmented reality through its own dynamic selfie filters.
These two examples so close to one other in time would probably be enough to make my point, but TechCrunch’s Josh Constine also found out that Facebook had fully built but then scrapped the launch of a Snapchat Stories clone on Facebook itself.
Meanwhile, it’s not entirely a one-way street. Snapchat launched Memories earlier this month, which is a pretty directly comparable offering to Facebook Moments. It not only brings some Facebook style permanence to a social network that perviously leaned heavily on ephemerality, but it also introduced the ability to pull content from your camera roll to snap, which allows brands and publishers to treat it more like Facebook and Instagram as an audience engagement channel.
I’m all for refinement, and I don’t think any technology company is wrong for identifying an effective interaction model or product, and trying to make it even more effective, or better suited to their own audience: That’s how we get nice things. But I can’t escape the feeling that the social space is starting to feel like so much tumbled glass, with a lot of retread and few new paths.
Sure, with more novel efforts, we’ve had some goofs. Beme. Peach. Twitter (I kid, sort of). It’s a list that includes some companies with a lot of early excitement, and founders who should know a thing or two about social. At least, though, they had some sharp edges, and it’d be nice to see a few more of those coming from the players who can stand to absorb the most risk.",2016-08-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/social-tumbler.jpg?w=738,snapchat-stories,The social app redundancy engine
838,Sarah Perez,"If you’ve visited a business or brand’s Facebook Page in recent days, you may have noticed things look a little different. The company is now finalizing the rollout of a new, cleaner look-and-feel for Pages, which does away with tabs in favor of left-hand side navigation, and makes the Page’s call-to-action button – like “Sign Up,” “Shop Now,” “Learn More,” etc. – far more prominent than before, among other things.
These revamped Facebook Pages were first spotted in the wild earlier this summer. The new design seen then featured a larger Cover photo and omitted the display ads that normally appeared on the right-hand side of desktop Pages, a Facebook spokesperson confirmed at the time.
However, the company said then that the new Pages were only a test, and didn’t indicate that the design would be pushed to all Facebook Page owners, nor did it provide a deadline.
Over the past several weeks, more Facebook users have seen these new Pages go live and we understand that most are now seeing the Pages’ redesign at this time. A lot of people finally gained access to the new Pages this week, in fact. (In other words, if you are not seeing them yet, you should very soon.)

The most significant change in terms of interacting with the Pages’ content is that the new Page no longer has tabs. Instead, it feels more like a traditional website, featuring navigation on the left-hand side that will allow you to more easily browse its various sections, like its About page, or the Page’s Photos, Videos, Events, Likes and more.
As seen in the tests, the Page’s Profile Picture and Cover Photo have also been repositioned. The Profile picture now appears on the top left of the Page above the new navigation.
That means that the Profile pic will no longer block the Page’s Cover Photo, which is shifted off to the right. The Cover Photo is still the same size as before, however (828×315 pixels), so businesses will not need to make any immediate changes unless they had crafted a Cover image in a way that either worked around the Profile pic or cleverly tied the two pictures together in some way.

More importantly, perhaps, is the way the new Pages make it easier for customers to interact with the business or brand in question. The bright blue call-to-action button now appears on the top right, directly beneath the Cover Photo. This button can be configured to encourage users to take the action the business wants to promote, whether that’s to shop their retail site, book an appointment, learn more about their business, watch a video, or any number of things.
In order to make room for all the new elements, the new Pages also no longer sport the right-side display ads, contributing to the overall cleaner feel that accompanies this update.
While seemingly this move could have an impact on Facebook’s bottom line, the company’s most recent earnings indicate that desktop ads are no longer where Facebook generates the most revenue. Instead, the company said that 84 percent of its ad revenue now comes from mobile, and total ad revenue was $6.24 billion.
The new design is meant to bring the desktop Pages more in line with the mobile updates for Pages Facebook announced last year.
A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the redesigned Pages’ launch to TechCrunch, saying “We’ve introduced a new design for Pages on desktop to make it easier for people to learn about and interact with businesses on Facebook, including a new column for tab navigation and a more prominent call-to-action button.”
The spokesperson also confirmed the rollout is nearly complete, adding “on August 3rd, we expanded the rollout of the new design for Pages on desktop computers and it’s nearly at 100%.”
The company this week also introduced new sections for merchants on Facebook to promote their goods and services, within a services section Pages. This feature, however, is available in markets in Southeast Asia and other areas, such as Thailand, Brazil, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, India, Argentina and Taiwan.",2016-08-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/shutterstock_140953558.jpg?w=738,facebook-pages,Facebook’s redesigned business Pages roll out to all
839,Josh Constine,"Snapchat opens to the camera by default to spur content creation, and now Facebook is trying the same starting with an Olympics-themed test in Brazil and Canada. Instead of just the “What are you doing?” text status update prompt, users will see an open camera window as Facebook executes on Mark Zuckerberg’s promise to put “video at the heart of all of our apps.”
The new feature also sports the first official integration of Facebook’s acquisition MSQRD’s animated selfie filters, which are similar to Snapchat’s selfie Lenses. Using MSQRD’s object recognition tech, users can swipe to apply different Olympics face paint like Brazilian flags and “Go Canada!” that match the contours of their face. People can also add static graphic overlay filters like “Team Canada”, similar to Snapchat’s geofilters, to photos and videos they shoot or upload.
Here’s a demo of the features:

The test that I call the “camerafeed” will roll out today to all iOS and Android users in Canada plus iOS users in Brazil, and run through the end of the Olympics. If users show they prefer the camerafeed design and create more content with it, it could be released to everyone.
“The way that people share has changed a lot” Facebook Product Manager Sachin Monga tells me. “12 years ago, most of what was shared was text” so Facebook’s status composer with a big white text box. “Now, mobile changed things a little bit, but we didn’t really change our tools. If you look at what people are sharing, now it’s mostly photos, and soon it will be mostly videos. Our strategy is really simple. We want to make it really easy to share photos and videos” Monga explains.
It can always be a bit shocking to suddenly see your own triple-chin face staring back at your from your phone. Luckily, all you have to do is scroll down and the camera disappears. If you flip it to face the other direction, it will stick like that so you don’t see your awkward self next time.
Here, Facebook is trying to combat the reported decline in original content sharing. According to figures attained by The Information, original content sharing like status updates, photos, and home-made videos, was down 15% year over year on Facebook as of February. Facebook’s feed began to be dominated by impersonal, generic link sharing and posts by news publishers. But original shares from friends are what make Facebook an indispensable daily habit.
Opening the News Feed to the camera will encourage Facebook’s 1.1 billion daily users to take and share more photos and videos. And thanks the MSQRD filters, people can jazz up their face so they feel less self-conscious or basic about sharing selfies.
When asked where the idea for the camera feed design came from, and whether Snapchat inspired it, Monga was unusually candid, matching the sentiment of Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom who said “They deserve all the credit” when asked about Instagram Stories cloning Snapchat.
“I think there’s a macro level inspiration in the way that people are sharing on Facebook. The modern composer is not going to be centered around a text box, it’s going to be centered around a camera” Monga started.
But when pressed about Snapchat, he said “I think they’ve done a really good job of building a modern composer. The thing that’s created the change from text to visual sharing is that everyone has a phone and a camera in their pocket, but they’ve definitely done a really good job with it.”

Eventually, Facebook wants to build even more “magical augmented reality” into its camera, Monga says. Facebook already had graphic filters called “Profile frames” and the ability to add drawings, text, and doodles to your photo uploads. You also could save animated selfies from MSQRD and upload them to Facebook. But now these features are front and center instead of being buried.
And if you think this is just Facebook copying Snapchat’s filters…well, you’re right, but remember that Snapchat originally bought its dog face and flower crown filters through the acquisition of startup Seene.
Could more original content sharing hurt publishers who want you posting their links instead? “In the short term this is something we’re really curious to see” Monga says. “Hopefully we’re not changing much of the dynamics about how News Feed works. Sharing original content on Facebook is a really stronger driver of time spent on Facebook, so this change should benefit everyone.”
Except maybe Snapchat. Between bringing the popular AR selfie filters to News Feed and Instagram launching Stories, Facebook is clearly going full-force at Snapchat. It might not be able to lure away Snapchat’s loyal 150 million daily users. But if it can create good enough clones of its best features, it might box out Snapchat from stealing hundreds of millions of additional users from Facebook.",2016-08-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/techcrunch-facebook-camera-feed.png?w=738,,Facebook tests MSQRD selfie filters and opening your camera atop feed
840,Sarah Perez,"A number of businesses use Twitter to interact with their customers and offer support. But that often means responding to angry tweets directed at their account, then switching users over to private messaging to deal with the issues at hand. Now the company is testing a new feature for brands that puts its “Messaging” button front-and-center, thereby encouraging customers to start their conversations with the business via DM (direct message) instead of in public view.
The new button appears on mobile and takes over the full space where the “Tweet to” and “Message” buttons used to live side-by-side. The end result is that it’s actually easier for users to start a private conversation with the brand in question, as their attention is directed to the bigger button, as opposed to the “create a tweet” interface.
Some accounts that already have this feature enabled on mobile include @AppleSupport, @Uber_Support, @BeatsSupport, @ATVIAssist (Activision Support), among others.
We understand this test is just an experiment for the time being, and it hasn’t made its way to all its business users at this time. It’s also not a configurable setting at this point, either – so there’s not a way for any user or brand to enable it for themselves.
Twitter often runs small tests of new features, which include things like user interface changes, button size tweaks, changes to button locations and more. Seeing a tweak like this in the wild isn’t a confirmation that it will become an official feature.
However, this one would make sense as something businesses might like to utilize as it helps them better take charge of their customer conversations.
In addition, many of the accounts spotted sporting the larger “Message” button also have the new “Featured” tweets section enabled. This is something Twitter is testing with brands to help them provide better customer service, as it allows the brand to showcase a curated collection of their accounts’ tweets. You can see this section live on IFTTT’s profile, for example.
The accounts with the big Messages button generally have the new feature that shows their “most responsive times” enabled, too. For instance, Apple’s support Twitter account says that it’s most responsive to users between the hours of 8 a.m. and 11 p.m. This information is displayed above the Message button.
The idea to show users how responsive they are to customers is something Facebook has been doing with its business Pages for some time. However, the most recent Page redesign seems to have done away with this informational text for the time being.

841,Natasha Lomas,"On-demand food delivery startup Deliveroo has stepped back from trying to force a new payment contract on its existing riders in London, after a group organized protests against a planned trial of a new payment model due to kick off tomorrow.
The new payment model seeks to switch riders from the £7 per hour plus £1 per delivery rate they currently earn to a fixed fee of £3.75 per delivery.
Protesters had argued the structure could see them working for nothing at certain points of the day, as well as risking safety by encouraging more haste to pack in a greater number of deliveries per hour.
Although also initially only slated as a trial — limited to five delivery areas in London — Deliveroo was asking all its riders sign new contracts reflecting the new payment model.
Riders unhappy with the proposed changes, and the requirements being placed on them as a result of the trial, organized protests — including picketing Deliveroo’s head office in London — dragging the media spotlight onto co-founder William Shu who came out to publicly defend the company’s actions, including answering some awkward questions on the BBC’s flagship radio news program, Today…
The debate even generated a verbal intervention from the UK government, with a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy commenting that companies cannot shirk their responsibility to pay the UK’s National Minimum Wage (of £7.20 per hour). (Albeit the protestors were actually calling for Deliveroo to pay a higher London Living Wage, of £9.40/hour.)
As is typical with gig economy platforms Deliveroo does not employ (in a legal sense) the grassroots workforce who make the deliveries via its platform — but rather defines them ‘independent contractors’ who are offering their services via its tech platform; a structure that of course makes it far harder for workers to organize collective industrial action or negotiate better pay and conditions.
Even so, the Deliveroo protestors appear to have achieved some concessions in this instance via their ad hoc protest, looping in the Independent Workers Union’s Couriers & Logistics Branch to help with organization and PR.
They also turned to crowdfunding to finance their protest — which they dubbed a strike. At the time of writing the strike fund has raised more than £12,700, from close to 1,000 donors, although the protestors are now telling the public to stop giving donations as they are intending to go back to work during the trial now that Deliveroo will not force them to sign new contracts.
Other concessions made by Deliveroo over the course of the protest include not forcing drivers to switch to the new payment model, as they initially said riders in the trial zone would have to. Riders can now opt out, although if they do that they will still have to move zones — but Deliveroo has said they will only be asked to move to a neighboring zone, “no more than two miles away”.
The company also added some payment guarantees to the new model during peak times to try to reassure riders their earnings will not be negatively impacted by the change. Initially there had been zero guarantees, with payment purely tied to completed deliveries.
Deliveroo’s original requirement that existing riders sign a new contract was branded heavy-handed by the protestors, who argued that if the trial was really a trial — not a foregone conclusion — the company should not be requiring them to agree to new terms before the start of it.
That argument appears to have won the day, although what happens after the 90 day trial period comes to a close and the company assesses the success of the new pay structure remains to be seen. (According to a report in The Guardian it is already signing new riders onto the new contract.)
Writing in a blog post detailing the latest Deliveroo concession late yesterday, Shu said: “Signing the new pay-per-delivery service agreement will not be compulsory during the trial — if riders want to continue working in their zone under the pay-per-delivery trial to see how it works for them, they can do so.”
“This is a trial -– a chance to try something new, to work with our riders to find out if it’s an improvement or not, and iterate from there. Trials of this scheme in other locations have proved a success and feedback from riders has been positive, that’s why we have continued to trial this new programme,” he added.
The trial itself is “continuing as planned”, according to a Deliveroo spokesman.
Earlier this month the company closed a $275 million Series E round of funding — which we reported as valuing Deliveroo at close to $1 billion.",2016-08-17,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/moped-1.jpg?w=738,"gig-economy,strike,deliveroo,william-shu",Deliveroo won’t force new pay-per-delivery contract on protesting riders in London — yet
842,Natasha Lomas,"European online glasses retailer MyOptique, which operates websites such as Glasses Direct and SunGlasses Shop in the UK and Lensbest in Germany, has been acquired by French lens maker Essilor International.
Sources suggest the price for the acquisition is close to €140M (~$158M) — but a figure has not been officially confirmed.
MyOptique has pulled in some £55 million in VC funding over its eleven years of operation — at current exchange rates that’s around $71M, thanks to Brexit’s impact on the pound sterling exchange rate. So there’s an element of Brexit making a UK company more affordable to a European buyer here, although we understand this specific transaction was in train well before the referendum result at the end of June so wasn’t a significant factor in the deal.
MyOptique, which reports annual revenues of £56 million, was founded back in 2005. Investors cashing out in the sale include Index Ventures, Highland Europe, Acton Capital Partners, Beringea, Cipio Partners and Korys.
Highland Europe’s Fergal Mullen admitted it took “a bit longer than expected” to achieve meaningful scale with MyOptique’s ecommerce play (having invested in 2007), but he couched glasses retailing as one of the hardest ecommerce sectors to get right — given it’s not just a question of casual fashion and fit but a highly personal style decision and a prescription item.
“Like all ecommerce businesses you just have to achieve scale and you have to achieve profitable unit economics before anybody’s going to be interested in acquiring the business,” he added, pointing to other long-time-in-the-baking European ecommerce exits, such as Privalia and PhotoBox, as “setting the line” for this type of startup exit.
“They’ve done a great job,” he added of MyOptique. “They’ve built a pan-European business across all aspects of the optical sector from prescription eyewear, to soft lenses, to fashion… It’s really a good story, and a real European story.”
Post-acquisition, MyOptique’s management will remain in place, the two companies said today.
The business will also continue to operate under its existing brands — with the focus for the acquisition being on leveraging Essilor’s global supply chain and operating businesses to expand the reach and efficiency of the MyOptique business across Europe.
Commenting on the acquisition in a statement, Maurice Helfgott, chairman of MyOptique, added: “The business has achieved pan European scale, is growing fast and had a number of strategic options for its next stage. Joining Essilor, the world leader in ophthalmic optics, was by far the most compelling one.”
For its part Essilor said the acquisition will enable it to broaden its online footprint to central Europe, as well as bolstering its capabilities in “multi-category, multi-brand models”.
The company reported consolidated revenue of more than €6.7 billion last year. It sells its products in more than 100 countries, operating 32 plants, 490 prescription laboratories and edging facilities, and five R&D centers around the world.",2016-08-16,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-14-at-4-22-15-pm.png?w=738,"glasses,myoptique,corrective-lenses",Online glasses retailer MyOptique sells to lens-maker Essilor for close to $160M
843,Romain Dillet,"If you’re reading this article and live in the U.S., you might not realize that Venmo, Square Cash, Facebook Messenger payments and other similar services only work in the U.S. In many countries, such as Germany, most people still have to rely on wire transfers and IBANs to send money to their friends. German startup Cookies wants to make peer-to-peer payments as easy as 1-2-3. It is launching today in Germany.
Founded by former N26 employees, Cookies ticks all the right boxes when it comes to payment apps. It’s free, fast and convenient. And yet, one thing differs from most competitors.
On Cookies, you don’t have a balance. Any incoming transfer goes straight to your bank account, and outgoing transfers tap directly into your bank account as well.
When you sign up, you enter your online bank account information to plug Cookies with your bank account directly. The startup is compatible with around 4,500 banks in Germany. It partnered with Deutsche Kreditbank AG (DKB) as the banking back end.

After that, you can send money to your friends using a phone number or email address. Every time you send money, it initiates a conversation with your friend so that you can send a few messages.
And you can add an emoji with your payment. Cookies call them paymojis, and some of them have special powers. For instance, the lightning paymoji lets you send a lightning-fast super payment. While it takes 1 to 3 business days for a normal payment, a super payment only takes 5 to 120 minutes.
“It’s the fastest transaction app in Germany,” co-founder and head of product Lamine Cheloufi told me.
There are two other nifty features that hint at the future of Cookies. First, on the main screen, there’s a giant cookie in the middle. If you tap on it, you can see notifications. Later, the company plans to add an intelligence layer and turn this cookie into a sort of smart assistant. While this sounds a bit like Clippy, the app is well-designed so I’m confident that the startup will use the cookie in a tasteful way.
Second, given that you linked your bank account with Cookies, you can tap on your bank account in the profile page, and the app will tell you your current balance. I feel like peer-to-peer payments are just the first step. Cookies may have bigger goals and could end up being the finance app to rule them all, letting you check all your bank accounts from this app, making payments and more.
Cookies is only available in Germany with an invitation system for now. But if you use this link, you should be able to jump the queue a bit. The startup plans to roll out in Austria and Switzerland pretty soon, and maybe other European countries later.
Right now, you can only send 100 euros per month using Cookies because the app doesn’t ask for all your personal information. In the future, Cookies could raise this limit by complying with “know your customer” rules and ask for your passport scan and more.
Overall, Cookies sounds like a promising app. It could be a breath of fresh air for German customers. Other European countries already have convenient peer-to-peer payment apps, but Cookies is a well-executed product that should work quite well in Germany.",2016-08-16,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/laminecheloufi-garrykrugljakow-4.jpg?w=738,"payment,cookies",Peer-to-peer payment app Cookies launches in Germany

Understatement of the day, month, year, decade: net neutrality is a controversial issue.
As U.K. tech minister, I was involved in the issue for the six years I held the post. Just recently the European Union adopted its first net neutrality law.
It’s widely seen as doing the opposite of what it’s supposed to — effectively ending net neutrality as true believers see it. I don’t agree, but nor do I necessarily think it was a sensible move. A bit of a contradictory position, but I will try to explain what I mean.
First things first — there’s no clear definition of net neutrality, and it’s definitely seen differently between Europe and the U.S.
The U.S. effectively has a telecoms duopoly, so without strong regulation, there’s a fear the two big telcos could sow things up. That’s why net neutrality features in U.S. presidential elections, but doesn’t register big over here.
Europe has much more competition between telcos, so if one company tries to manage traffic unfairly, it’s likely to lose out with consumers (at least the savvy ones).
In the U.K., we introduced a code of conduct for net neutrality, which all the ISPs signed up to.  That was a good solution. It was light touch and flexible.
The regulator had powers it could use to intervene, and we stood ready to give it more if it needed them. The code struck a balance between the need  for legitimate traffic management and the necessity to stop anti-competitive practices.
So why do we now have a law? For some years now, there’s been a lot of agitation for a European net neutrality law. The Dutch passed their own. The Baltic states, given their cyber focus, wanted their own. The European Parliament made it a major issue.
The momentum was pretty unstoppable — and the law was linked to another telco issue which we badly wanted: mobile roaming.
Tech regulation on the whole is a bad thing.
There are a lot of public policy issues in tech, but many can be solved by co-operation between industry and governments. Agreements maintain flexibility, and allow us to bring in changes when they’re needed, or act quickly on unintended consequences.
So I would have preferred to avoid a law. But I don’t think this law will be as bad as anyone says, and it in effect follows the principles we set out in the U.K. code of conduct. It does enshrine the principle of net neutrality. It carves out exceptions — but that is what they are: Departures from the norm that need to be justified by telcos, and which can be acted on by regulators.
Certainly, we need to ensure innovation and the room for startups to grow. But we also need to acknowledge legitimate traffic management, and the need for infrastructure investment.",2016-08-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/meps-european-parliament.jpg?w=640,"united-kingdom,ed-vaizey",On the EU’s net neutrality law
845,Natasha Lomas,"On-demand restaurant food delivery startup Deliveroo is facing more protests in London this week over a new pay structure it’s trialling in the U.K. capital that seeks to switch drivers to a fixed fee of £3.75 per delivery, rather than the £7 per hour plus £1 per delivery they earn under the old pay structure.
A group of angry Deliveroo drivers are now crowdfunding a “strike fund”, via the Crowdpac platform, to help those protesting the new pay structure, given that — as ‘independent contractors’ working on a tech platform — they are foregoing the ability to earn during time spent protesting.
Financial means aside, the fear of being easily replaced is another reason why it is difficult for gig economy non-unionized, autonomous freelancers to organize and engage in collective bargaining with their platform-controlling employers.
For that reason, the IWGB says today’s protest will target a company recruitment office in North London — to try to ensure the protest reaches the ears of potential new Deliveroo recruits.
The protestors have apparently been offloading some of the associated organization and negotiation logistics onto the Independent Workers Union (IWGB) Couriers & Logistics Branch, which claims to have acted as their representatives in talks with Deliveroo.
Protesters have called for Deliveroo customers to cook their own dinner, instead of paying for a meal delivery, and donate to the fund instead.
At the time of writing the crowdfunder has pulled in close to £8,000 from some 600 donors to help finance the action.
Last week the protestors held a series of demonstrations against the new pay structure, arguing that it can result in payment as low as £0 to £3.75 per hour during slower periods (i.e if they’re only able to make up to one delivery per hour).
They argue the company should pay workers for time spent waiting to pick up deliveries not just for fulfilling a delivery. They also claim the new structure encourages drivers to take risks in order to speed up deliveries to make enough money to make ends meet.
(As is the rule with gig economy platform operators, Deliveroo workers — the company refers to them as “riders” — are also not offered employment benefits such as sick pay or holiday pay.)
The Deliveroo protestors are calling for the company to pay the London Living Wage of £9.40/hour plus costs (e.g. fuel for the moped they use to make deliveries) plus any tips and plus £1 per delivery.
Responding to that specific demand in an interview with TechCrunch, Deliveroo’s UK MD Dan Warne said: “Deliveroo riders receive more than that, on average, an hour and on the new model we believe they will continue to receive more than that.”
“We frame this new structure believing that drivers will make significantly more on average per hour, than the minimum wage,” he added.
In a note on its blog about the new payment model, the company says the pricing structure is aimed at increasing flexibility for riders. “We designed this trial to enable riders to work whenever they want by logging on-and-off as desired,” it writes in a blog post — which is closed to comments, despite also including the claim that “we’re committed to an open conversation, so we can continue to improve our payment model and delivery experience”…

“In the places we’ve piloted it, we’ve seen average hourly fees for riders increase by up to x2 the previous payment model at our busiest times,” Deliveroo added. “Many drivers tell us they will receive more fees over a shorter period of time with this model, and that this works better for them.”
Warne claimed that around 80 per cent of Deliveroo’s UK riders have other jobs — hence the ‘bottom up’ demand for more flexibility.
“By moving to this new model it allows individuals to work exactly when they want,” he said. “We have a Brazilian driver… he’s a DJ for most of his time and then the evenings he works for Deliveroo. On the old model he’s been somewhat restricted with the nights of the week that he can work — because he has to work a given shift, at a given time on given days of the week.
“Moving to this new model he’ll be able to plug in and work when he likes. If he wants to plug in and work for half an hour at nine PM he can do that.”
Although it was not initially doing so, Deliveroo is now providing some payment guarantees under the trial model — Warne notes it made this change after taking feedback from riders on the new model — such as offering the certainty of being paid for between two and three deliveries during busy periods. (Although at other times of the day payment depends entirely on deliveries fulfilled.)
In a statement provided to TechCrunch the company added:
The UK government chipped into the debate on Sunday, with a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy noting that Deliveroo must pay drivers the National Minimum Wage, of £7.20 per hour (via The Guardian) — unless a court or HM Revenue and Customs defines workers on the platform as ‘self-employed’. Employment tribunals can also be involved in determining a worker’s employment status — sometimes overturning an earlier HMRC classification. So determining employment status can be a complicated process.
Warne confirmed Deliveroo defines its riders as ‘independent contractors’, and said that is based on “a level of flexibility that’s given to the workforce”.
“In our case we offer significant flexibility with the traditional model and even more flexibility moving to the new model,” he said, adding: “The reason we’ve made these changes is because our drivers have been asking for them.”
He took pains to emphasize that the new pricing model is merely being trialled at this point, with the trial period set to run for 90 days — after which he said Deliveroo will assess how it went and make a decision on next steps. Nothing has been decided as yet, he added.
Some 280 of Deliveroo’s riders are currently affected by the trial — a sub-set of the 3,000 contractors it has working in the capital. While the five affected delivery zones are in North and North East London — including affluent areas such as West Hampstead and Belsize Park.
Warne said there are no plans to expand the trial to other London zones at this point.
Deliveroo riders in the affected zones can opt out of the new pricing model if they prefer to continue with the old pricing structure — although Warne confirmed the opt out was implemented after the company spoke to “around 250 riders over the past week”, to garner feedback.
“We decided to give them the choice,” he noted.
However those exercising this choice cannot continue working in the same area, and must move to a new zone — which a spokeswoman for the IWGB pointed out means learning a whole new territory; a process which she argued inevitably means taking a pay-cut because of the necessary learning curve.
Warne rebutted those criticisms, pointing to the small sizes of delivery zones (London Deliveroo riders will only travel a maximum of 2.2km per delivery), and arguing that navigation and mapping technology means there’s very little learning curve required nowadays.
“Zones in London are very, very small. So we’re talking about moving from somewhere like Camden to an area adjacent to that area. We’re not asking them to move to another town or another city or even to the south when they’re up in the north. It’s a very straightfoward move for them in order to stay on the existing model,” he said.
“The knowledge increasingly becomes less relevant with the technology we give them to navigate around the area… They will have an app on their phone which will navigate to the restaurant, and then from the restaurant out to the customer, giving them every opportunity to maintain the same speed, and the same number of deliveries that they do in their existing area.”
“We cannot run simultaneous trials within the same zone. The nature of the flexibility on a per drop model does require that one functional zone in London has that model in its entirety,” he added.
Other criticisms of the new payment model are that it incentivizes haste — ramping up safety risks for riders, i.e. given they will be focused on making more deliveries in order to earn more money.
On this point Warne claimed safety is “a number one priority” for Deliveroo, noting the company is working with road safety charities, and runs trials for new drivers who sign up to make deliveries via the platform.
“The opportunity for them to earn more money is going to come from Deliveroo’s ability to develop stronger algorithms and better technology so that they can do more in shorter periods of time. There’s a massive, enormous opportunity for us to do that,” he said. “The way the mapping works, for example, is to give them the safest route — not the quickest route. I’ve got to prioritize that above anything else i the business. Drivers are so important to us.
“The zone size and the delivery distances are never more than 2.2km for these drivers, so it ensures short routes where the majority of the time of the order is actually made up around things like the wait time in a restaurant. Or the acceptance time on the order coming through to the driver’s app. Because of those short distances it really doesn’t make a huge amount of difference if a driver can rush or not the bit between going from the restaurant to the customer.”
Of course there’s no guarantee Deliveroo won’t kill its old pay structure entirely in future — should it determine in its review of the trial that it’s better to do so. Without employment rights, gig economy workers that provide services on such tech platforms face ongoing precariousness with limited means to organize and protest changes.
Warne strongly denied IWGB allegations that some protesting riders had been dismissed by the company as entirely false, however.
He also denied an IWGB report of the company offering payment to riders to stop protesting or provide information on other riders who are participating in protests.
But he did concede the company regrets how it has communicated the payment trial to riders.
“We’re all really upset about how this has gone down and we’re beating ourselves up around the fact that we haven’t communicated well enough to drivers. That’s very, very clear to me,” he told TechCrunch.
“This is a new model where the safety net, the safety blanket of getting hourly pay is removed and thus you’ve got to really clearly communicate — through the data that we have on what the drivers do, and how many orders they can do in an hour at peak, which is sometimes even six or seven orders — we haven’t made that clear enough to them, which is why I think I a lot of them got upset.”
“I’m very happy to admit and frankly very happy to apologize for what I think has been poorly communicated on our part,” he added.
On the future of the £7 plus £1 model, Warne said: “It would only be discontinued if we were comfortable that drivers felt unanimously confident that this was right for them.”
Asked why Deliveroo’s rider contracts, seen by TechCrunch, include requirements to wear branded clothing during Deliveroo shifts — a measure which sounds akin to enforcing a uniform — Warne said this is a safety consideration because the clothing is “reflective”.
Earlier this month the startup, which was founded in 2013, closed a $275 million Series E round of funding — a new financing round which we reported as valuing Deliveroo at close to $1 billion.

The so-called “U-Start Club” also joined the round — they are an Italian group of investors which incorporates several family offices tied to the fashion industry in the country. You’d expect Italian fashion houses to invest in such a company, right? Existing investors Northzone Capital, Highland Europe, Holtzbrinck Ventures and Mangrove Capital Partners also participated. The startup will use the funds to expand in Europe and improve customer experience. Outfittery has now raised $59.81m in total, in five rounds from 12 Investors.
Julia Boesch, managing director and co-founder, says they will continue their “mission to revolutionise the shopping experience for men… in a world where clients are faced with way too many options while shopping.” Which is clearly code for “men can’t really deal with choice,” perhaps.
Founded by Anna Alex and Julia Boesch in 2012, the startup claims now to have 400,000 clients, in eight countries.

847,Steve O'Hear,"HeavenHR, a cloud-based HR management platform for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), has closed €6 million in Series A funding. Leading the round in the Berlin-based startup are Target Global, and Open Ocean.
HeavenHR, which is just 10 months old, says the new financing will be used to continue building out the product and to accelerate growth. The company is currently active in Germany, Austria, France and Switzerland,
Operating a rather subtle freemium model, the HR platform’s core functions, such as digital contracts, electronic personnel files, absence management and time tracking are free (similar to London’s CharlieHR), but HeavenHR charges for additional services such as payroll, benefits, pension and insurance management.
The pension aspect is reminiscent of London/Tel Aviv-based Hibob, which recently launched with $7.5 million in backing in a round led by Silicon Valley VC Bessemer Venture Partners.
There’s a lot of money to made in workplace pension enrollment by effectively operating as a pension broker, and a new breed of HR management startups are piggybacking pensions and, similarly, insurance. Come for the cloud-based HR tools, stay for the pensions and insurance, seems to be the mantra.
“Since we offer a pretty comprehensive product, we have many competitors in various fields,” says HeavenHR MD Johannes Roggendorf.
“On top of competitors such as paper forms and Excel, we have the old-fashioned payroll-only providers, traditional HR software companies whose products either lack in functionality or ease-of-use, and modern HR software companies that often offer limited features”.
And, on the insurance and pension side, Roggendorf says HeavenHR competes with offline and online brokers, but is at an advantage because the platform integrates various HR processes.

848,Natasha Lomas,"Pay-per-article journalism startup Blendle, which aggregates the written work of different publishers onto a single, ad-free platform where readers can pick and choose which stories to consume, paying a few cents per article, is touting passing one million registered users.
It’s taken Blendle just over two years to amass this many sign ups. The journalism micropayments platform kick-started its attempt to reboot digital media business models in Europe in April 2014, offering an alternative to publishers’ content-gating paywalls.
It’s not breaking out monthly active users but managing editor Michaël Jarjour tells TechCrunch that’s now in the “hundreds of thousands”. He adds that conversion into paying users remains unchanged, at 20 per cent.
The startup began working with publishers in its native Netherlands and in Germany, before expanding to the U.S. this March (in beta). It’s grown its business by 300 per cent over the past year, and is projecting that users will have read more than 20 million articles on its platform by the end of this year.
Jarjour says it remains focused on the latter two markets, with no plans to expand its market footprint further as yet. “The United States and Germany are our largest focus right now. These are tough nuts to crack,” he adds.
On the age front, he notes Blendle’s largest age group is now 30 year olds; previously it was 35-year-olds so the platform is touting a readership that’s getting younger.
One key feature is the ability of paying readers to get a refund on any story if they didn’t like what they read, although they are required to specify why they want a refund (and presumably refund abusers would soon be kicked off). Jarjour says Blendle’s refund rate is just under 10 per cent platform wide at this point, and a bit lower in the US — a rate he says is “basically unchanged”.
Blendle also manages access so if a user pays for multiple articles from a particular publication and exceeds the subscription cost for a particular issue the rest of the content is automatically unlocked. Idea being they won’t be paying more just for the privilege of being choosy.
Unlike social services with news streams powered by algorithmic popularity alone, Blendle touts human curation as core to its appeal, employing a team of in-house editorial staff reading content to surface what they deem ‘quality journalism’.
However it’s now testing a content personalization feature, called the Blendle Premium Feed, that will push a tailored feed of stories at each user.  The feed is being powered by a mix of algorithmic predictions, based on analysis of users’ past behavior and preferences, blended with human selections, via its own in house team. Its editorial staff are being used to identify and flag quality content to supplement algorithmic recommendations — with the aim of avoiding a content filter bubble scenario narrowing the horizons of its readers.
The feed is majority algorithmic recommendation, with human choices comprising around three stories per day — as ‘anti filter bubble picks’ — vs around 12 machine selected daily picks. It’s going to be a balancing act for sure, as Blende notes in its blog post announcing the new feature, which it says it’s still testing — adding that the first results are “encouraging”.
If your USP is ‘quality not filler’ then applying any kind of filtering algorithm to generate more content in your app is absolutely going to require to a softly, softly approach if you want to retain the readers you wooed with promises of your different approach. So it will be interesting to see how Blendle’s personalized predictions fare.
“For the Blendle Premium Feed we combine learnings we’ve collected from past behavior and predict how much you’ll like an article based on your preferences (that you tell us), based on what you’ve read before, and based on predictions we make. We make those predictions by analyzing each new story (story type, complexity, feel). Over the past few months editors have been training our algorithms to categorize stories better,” says Jarjour, explaining how the feature works.
“We avoid the filter bubble by having editors flag certain stories to be sent to all people. In addition, the signals we use are also optimized for surprise, and not only to what’s most popular or what you’d like the best.”
A purely algorithmic recommendation system is not something in Blendle’s “near future”, he says adding: “Human curation will remain a core component. We employ 15 journalists who read a combined 40 hours a day, seven days a week, to find stories that are especially worth reading, but are hidden on paper or behind paywalls currently.”
The premium feed is due to be rolled out “in the coming months”.",2016-08-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/p1040676.jpg?w=738,"filter-bubble,journalism,blendle",Blendle clocks up 1M signups for its pay-per-article journalism platform
849,Steve O'Hear,"Just days after Deliveroo, a popular on-demand restaurant food delivery startup in Europe, announced that it had raised another $275 million in funding, a number of the startup’s self-employed couriers in London have been holding a protest over possible changes to the way they are paid.
It’s being reported that after trialling a new payment model, which Deliveroo claims has been a success, the company will begin paying riders a fixed fee per deliver of £3.75 rather than the current hourly rate of £7 per hour plus £1 per delivery. This has left some of Deliveroo’s couriers unhappy enough to hold something akin to a strike.
That’s interesting, given that the so-called “gig economy” is one that is almost impossible to unionize in the traditional sense, because workers are typically self-employed and don’t have the shop floor to organize on. It’s also unclear how an autonomous group of freelance couriers would operate collective bargaining.
Regardless of the mechanism, Deliveroo says it’s always open to riders’ concerns and continues to listen to its contracted workforce. The London-based startup provided TechCrunch with the following comment:
Deliveroo is also adamant that under the per-delivery payment model, couriers will still typically be able to earn over £10 during lunch and dinner times, which is when the service sees the most demand. “The 2.2km size of each delivery zone has been designed with delivery distance and time in mind. Following extensive testing, this zone size was found to be the optimum size to ensure that riders could complete 2-3 orders an hour safely,” a Deliveroo spokesperson tells me.
Those protesting make the point, however, that since they are freelance they have to swallow other costs such as bike maintenance and things like tax and insurance, meaning take-home pay is a lot less. It’s a story familiar right across the gig economy, such as at companies like Uber, and not peculiar to Deliveroo’s model.
Meanwhile, it is also worth pointing out that Deliveroo has 3,000 riders in London, and those protesting were only a small group by comparison. Whether or not that remains the case over the next few days and weeks remains to be seen.",2016-08-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/moped-1.jpg?w=738,"on-demand-economy,on-demand-delivery,london,deliveroo",Deliveroo drivers hold protest in London over possible changes to the way they are paid
850,Steve O'Hear,"With the recent news of Take Eat Easy’s closure, and the time it reportedly took for Deliveroo to raise its latest round of funding, you’d be forgiven for thinking that, in the eyes of investors, the once-hot on-demand delivery space is cooling. And whilst that’s undoubtedly true (thanks in part to competition from Uber and Amazon), VCs haven’t stopped writing cheques entirely.

Taking part in the round are original backer Antai Venture Builder, Spain’s Seaya Ventures, Entreé Capital, Caixa Capital Risk, and Bonsai Venture Capital, along with a number of Glovo’s previous investors.
Noteworthy is that Entreé Capital also has a minority stake in Postmates, which speculatively sets up some potential partnership or acquisition scenarios further down the road. Despite a lot of talk of doing so, the U.S. on-demand delivery company has yet to expand to Europe.
In a call, Glovo co-founder and CEO Oscar Pierre told me the new capital will be used by the startup primarily to consolidate its presence in the countries it currently operates in — namely, Spain, Italy and France — and to continue building out the platform.
He also conceded that there has been a lot of negativity around the on-demand delivery space (“I have Steve O’Hear set up as a Google alert,” he revealed) but that much of this is to do with the lower margins and logistics challenge that (hot) food delivery faces in particular. This sees lunch and dinner peak times making it a lot harder to manage supply and demand, and keep a fleet of on-demand couriers happy and in work during down time.
To that end, Pierre says that non-food items, such as electronics and pharmaceuticals, now make up 50 per cent of orders. That’s significant since there’s potentially more margin outside of catering where average basket prices can be a lot higher and there’s a greater number of merchants to partner with.
Like competitor Jinn, which recently launched in Madrid (its first city outside the U.K.), it’s via direct partnerships with merchants where the real money is to be made. That’s because an official partnership results in Glovo receiving commission for each product bought through its app, which in turn means increased margins and the ability to pass on some of this revenue to customers in the form of lower delivery fees or no delivery fee at all.
Once delivery fees reach near-zero, a service like Glovo that promises to get you anything from your city delivered to you in under an hour, becomes a lot more sticky. In fact, Pierre isn’t ruling out a subscription model for the most frequent customers along the lines of Amazon Prime.
Another telling feature of Glovo is that Pierre claims the service is profitable on a per delivery basis, and therefore, unlike competitors, is not reliant on an average number of deliveries per hour per courier to make the model work.
That’s because the startup’s pricing is variable, based on distance (which is the formula by which couriers are paid), how aggressive it wants to be in a particular city or vertical, and how much kick-back Glovo will receive from the merchant in relation to a particular order.
Where the latter is zero because there is no merchant partnership in place, the resulting delivery fee, which is added at checkout, will be a lot higher. But, says Pierre, it also enables the startup to stick to its “anything you want, delivered in minutes” promise without burning too much cash. And, crucially, regardless of where in town and from what merchant the product originates.",2016-08-11,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/glover1.jpg?w=738,,"Delivery startup Glovo scores €5M Series A, backers include Postmates investor Entreé Capital"
851,Haje Jan Kamps,"Amsterdam-based TRVL is aiming to shake up the travel industry by turning you (and that guy, and the lady over there and that chap over there, too) into a travel agent. The platform is a sharing-economy approach to booking travel for your friends and complete and utter strangers.
The pain point TRVL believes it will be able to relieve is that people are spending way too long dithering before firming up their travel plans.
“Studies show we spend hours researching our trips online — just to cut through the noise, narrow down our choices and build up enough confidence to book,” says Jochem Wijnands, CEO at TRVL. “Recommendations go a long way, especially if they are coming from people you trust.”
Which makes sense, but seems to make the assumption that only people with well-traveled friends travel, which may not be true for everyone. Even if the platform expands to accepting travel advice from friends-of-friends… well, let’s just say I am connected to quite a few people on social media whose friends I wouldn’t necessarily trust to give good travel advice.
The company is operating on an interesting business model. By using the TRVL platform to book the trips, agents are able to tap into the slightly discounted agency rates for booked trips. The traveler pays the same they would anyway, but the commission paid by the hotel chains, airlines and car rental companies is split between TRVL and the agents. The idea is that, in effect, travelers get TRVL’s service for free.
It’s a tremendously interesting move. Whether the company will succeed will depend on if it manages to make the marketplace economics work in the notoriously slim-margined travel space. Either way, I think it will be one to watch.
Wijnands is no rookie in the startup world; his previous startup Prss was picked up by Apple and later turned into the Apple News Format, which was subsequently integrated into iOS.

852,Steve O'Hear,"Entrepreneur First (EF), the London-based so-called “talent first” investor that targets technical graduates in Europe and beyond to put them through a six-month program where they form teams and in turn found startups, is building its own U.S. based investment team and network.

And to bridge that gap, which he says has seen Europe “trail the U.S. in both deal count and aggregate investment,” Wichrowski is moving to Boston to head up EF’s U.S. office and specifically to build better ties to the investment community across the pond to help EF portfolio companies raise future funding — a metric the “pre-team, pre-idea” startup builder will increasingly be judged on.
“For the past few years, EF has primarily been measured by the quality of the teams coming out of our core program at Demo Day. Over time, however, our KPI will transition to whether we can consistently nurture alumni that grow into global businesses,” writes Wichrowski. “That growth requires investment, and a key component of success will be our teams’ ability to fundraise. The world’s best companies require the world’s best capital”.
Much of that capital, of course, resides in the U.S. (as does some of EF’s existing LPs, for that matter), and the plan, says EF co-founder and Chief Executive Matt Clifford, was always to recruit a U.S.-based investment team and build a U.S. investor network as the program scales from tens to hundreds of startups/alumni. However, I get the sense this may have happened a little more urgently after Wichrowski, who only joined EF a few months ago, announced he intended to move to the other side of the Atlantic.
“We wanted to do this anyway and didn’t expect Matt Wichrowski to be the guy,” admits Clifford. “He joined us in March, worked with us for four months and absolutely aced it, so when he announced he was moving to the U.S. we decided to kill two birds with one stone”.
The EF co-founder is also keen to stress that the move is less a diss to the scale and ambition of European VC (and its sometimes reluctance to invest in the types of “deep tech” that EF, with its focus on technical talent, aims to foster), but more a necessary move given the scale at which EF itself is growing.
“This isn’t about Euro VC lagging, it’s really about EF’s scale,” he says. “In 2014 we created 9 companies we needed to get funded; in 2015, 25; this year, 50; and next year 75… We’re scaling a lot faster than the U.K. funding ecosystem, so it’s important that we can access the best early stage capital for our companies, wherever that happens to be — London, Singapore, U.S…”.
To that end, Clifford says EF is already seeing tonnes of inbound interest from U.S. investors, fuelled in part by the recent exit of alumni Magic Pony to Twitter for up to $150 million, which raised a few eyebrows given that the startup was less than two years old.
Adds Wichrowski: “Early-stage investment is a relationship-driven business, and we are excited about our ability to nurture those relationships and offer them as a value-add to our EF alumni. My mission will be to provide our teams a highly curated view of the most relevant investors and tailored guidance for their unique fundraising needs. And my hope is that this upfront effort will significantly reduce the time and energy drain for our founders.”
In addition to Wichrowski building an investor network in the U.S., Business Insider reports that Entrepreneur First partner Wendy Tan White and Entrepreneur First head of programme Jade Read, will liaise with investors in the U.K. and Europe, and Alex Crompton, the director of Entrepreneur First’s Singapore operation, will look to build investor support in Singapore.",2016-08-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img-4.jpg?w=738,entrepreneur-first,Entrepreneur First recruiting U.S. investment team because European VC lags European talent
853,Jon Russell,"It is finally confirmed: Tencent has announced that it has acquired a majority ownership of Supercell, the massively profitable Finnish firm behind hit game Clash Of Clans, for around $8.6 billion.
Tencent has been rumored to be close to a deal to buy the shares from SoftBank for the past month or so, and today it confirmed that it is acquiring 84 percent of Supercell. The remaining shares will continue to be held by Supercell’s staff, while SoftBank is parting with all of its stake. The transaction values Supercell at around $10.2 billion.
SoftBank bought a majority share in six-year-old Supercell back in 2013, when it teamed up with GungHo — one of its portfolio companies — to buy 51 percent of the firm for just over $1.5 billion. It increased its holding to 73 percent one year ago, but, despite a sizable return on its original outlay, it is moving on from as part of a series of high-profile divestments. SoftBank has also cashed out most of its GungHo shares, while it is selling $7.9 billion in Alibaba shares — its first trade of that stock ever — to cut its debt, which was as high as 11.9 trillion yen ($107 billion) at the end of March.
The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. Tencent pledged to continue the same hands-off approach that Supercell had enjoyed under the ownership of SoftBank.
“Supercell will retain its independent operations, the headquarters will remain in Helsinki, Finland and its existing team will continue to run all operations of the Company,” Tencent said in a statement.
The company added that every employee remains a shareholder, and will be permitted to sell their vested shares to Tencent every year in order to “focus on continued success… and enhance this commitment.”
Masayoshi Son, SoftBank chairman and CEO, paid tribute to Supercell’s team and leadership, and explained that the divestment is part of a new strategy for his firm.
“Supercell is known for its creativity, focus on player experience, and unique culture, which have enabled it to create innovative mobile games that are wildly popular globally. Tencent is dedicated to building long-term strategic partnerships with leading game companies,” Martin Lau, President of Tencent, said in a statement.
“We are excited that Supercell is joining our global network of game partners, and will preserve their players around the world. It is important to us that Supercell stays true to its roots by sustaining its unique culture, continuing to be headquartered in Finland, and representing its home proudly,” Lau added.
The acquisition of Supercell is a major coup for Tencent, which is a mobile behemoth in its own right. Tencent owns all of Riot Games, the studio behind League Of Legends, and it has investments in a bunch of game makers that include Epic Games and Activision Blizzard. Content aside, it is also in a strong position as a distributor via QQ and WeChat, its two blockbuster messaging services. As of the end of 2015, QQ had 853 million active users while WeChat had 697 million, according to Tencent’s data.
Earlier this year, Supercell said its four titles — Clash Of Clans, Boom Beach, Hay Day and Clash Royale — had reached over 100 million cumulative players each day. Those games helped the firm to a pre-tax profit of €838 million (approximately $960 million), up some 60 percent year-on-year despite revenue growth slowing during the same period.

854,Jon Russell,"Social commerce, the idea of buying products listed on social media sites, is huge in Asia. So huge that Facebook recently jumped into the space with a payments trial in Southeast Asia, and it is far from the only one eyeing an industry that’s thought to account for as much as one-third of online commerce in the region.
From a merchant’s perspective, Instagram, Facebook and other sites are easy ways to post photos of items you are selling in your ‘shop’, but discovery and payments are tricky issues for customers. There have been plenty of companies trying to bring a more orderly approach to things, the latest of which is Goxip, a Hong Kong-based startup.
“When you see anything online or on Instagram, the frustration is that you can’t shop even when people are using it as merchants,” Juliette Gimenez, Goxip CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch in an interview.
Gimenez’s take is “shoppable Instagram:” an app that uses image recognition and a large collection of retailers — 400-500 merchants selling over two million items from upwards of 15,000 brands — to create a more engaging and ultimately more fruitful social commerce experience.

Goxip won the top startup award at the inaugural Rise conference last year, just months after being founded. The company started out with an Android app, but over the last year it has redeveloped that app, launched a version for iOS and closed a $1.62 million seed funding round.
That financing was led by an interesting source — the daughter of Malaysian billionaire Vincent Tan, Chairman of Berjaya Group — with participation from existing early investor Ardent Capital. Gimenez — who cut her teeth at Groupon and later LivingSocial in Asia — told us that the money is being used to expand Goxip from Hong Kong into Malaysia and other parts of Southeast Asia. (Where some of the world’s most notable social commerce markets, and active users of Instagram and Facebook, are located.)
The app itself works by matching uploaded images with fashion items sold by its merchant partners. That’s the basic premise, but Gimenez, co-founder and CPO YC Lau and team built a range of social hooks around that.
For example, I can sync my Goxip account to my Instagram account so I can post pics of my favorite outfits, and tag up to five related items from Goxip retail partners. (Ok, so, as a 30-plus male with limited fashion sense and a tendency to spend my free time at a laptop, I might not be the prime target, but it worked ok for me even without a Mr. Men collection in the options.)

While it is cute for fashion noob like me to post pics of items on Goxip, the service has far more potential when it comes to established fashion figures, such as celebrities or high-profile bloggers. By posting their own photos, screenshots or more, they have the ability to express themselves to their fans and audience in a new way that is complementary to what they already do.
For example, a fashion blogger could use Goxip alongside Instagram to help sell products, or enable their audience find a specific look that they recommend.
You don’t need to rely on so-called taste makers though. The Goxip app lets you search through photos uploaded by users — including those from me! — which is another way to browse new looks or get fashion ideas on the go. You can also just upload a pic without making it public if you want to find a particular item that you somehow ran into on the internet.
The original idea behind Goxip was to meld celebrity and fashion news with commerce. You can still search for celebs and find matches with their threads, but the new Goxip appears to have a much stronger community focus than the original incarnation of the app.

Despite the many figures experts have put on the space — the market in Thailand alone could be worth upwards of $510 million per year — it is a tough nut to crack. For Goxip, distribution looks to be the real challenge, so channeling bloggers and influencers is a logistic step. On that note, Gimenez said Goxip has plans to “help bloggers to monetize,” offer commission, and encourage high-profile users to open stores inside the app in the future.
But, with big companies like Facebook now actively eyeing this space, and tonnes of money pouring into e-commerce companies — such as Alibaba’s $1 billion investment in Lazada — the competition is truly fierce.
“We have a worldwide outlook but our primary focus is on Asia,” Gimenez said. “The opportunity lies in Asia [where] the mobile penetration rate is crazy and people are ready” to buy from social platforms.
Goxip is available for iOS, Android and at Goxip.com.",2016-06-21,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/goxip-4.jpg?w=738,"social-commerce,shoppable-instagram",Goxip is a ‘shoppable Instagram’ for fashion followers in Asia
855,Jon Russell,"Walmart is partnering with China’s second largest e-commerce firm, JD.com, as it aims to take a larger bite out of the world’s most populous country.
In a wide-ranging alliance announced Monday, the U.S. retail giant said it has sold Yihaodian, its online commerce marketplace, to JD.com. Walmart will retain the Yihaodian direct sales business, but rather than operate its own online store entirely, it will become a retailer inside Yihaodian. It is also bringing its Sam’s Club membership service to JD.com, while Walmart’s physical stores will be listed on JD.com’s O2O JV Dada delivery platform.
On the financial side of things, Walmart is buying a five-percent stake in NASDAQ-listed JD.com, which is slowly increasing its marketshare and closing the gap on Alibaba. That investment is worth around $1.5 billion right now based on JD.com’s share price.
Walmart first invested in Yihaodian, which specializes in grocery and items focused on affluent female consumers — in 2011 and it bought the B2C service its entirety last summer: so why is it cutting a deal to get out of the business less than a year later?
The U.S. giant seems to have fully realized that the Chinese market is dominated by two major players, and it is seriously cutthroat.
Data from iResearch suggests that Yihaodian accounts for less than two percent of China’s e-commerce spending — Alibaba and JD.com are collectively over 80 percent — although Walmart claims the service is strongest in eastern and southern China. Based on that, it makes sense to lean on JD.com as the distribution partner to help grow its business in China.
The Wall Street Journal reported that one-third of the $482.1 billion in annual sales that Walmart makes outside the U.S. market comes from China, so the country is clearly still hugely important. It’ll certainly be interesting to see how it fares with JD.com, which differentiates itself from Alibaba by owning its own logistics and specializing in fast delivery and fresh goods.
It isn’t uncommon to see e-commerce players sell on rival platforms. Amazon opened a store on Alibaba’s Taobao mall last year, for example.
“JD.com shares similar values in making the lives of customers better. It also has a very complementary business and is an ideal partner that will help us offer compelling new experiences that can reach significantly more customers,” Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart, said in a statement.",2016-06-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/walmart-china.jpg?w=738,"e-commerce,ecommerce,jd-com,walmart","Walmart sells Yihaodian, its Chinese e-commerce marketplace, to Alibaba rival JD.com"
856,Jon Russell,"Mubi, an alternative take on Netflix, has scrapped plans to launch a local version of its streaming service in China.
Back in January, the London-based company announced plans to introduce a joint-venture alongside Huanxi Media, a local media production firm in China, as part of a deal that would see Huanxi invest a total of $50 million into both Mubi China and the global Mubi service.
That isn’t going ahead, according to a filing made to the Hong Kong stock exchange from Huanxi, which explained that the previous agreement has been terminated. Huanxi didn’t provide a reason for the termination, but it did say that both sides are “discussing other possible forms of cooperation.”
There’s no suggestion at this point that the decision impacting Mubi — which differs from Netflix and others through a rolling selection of 30 films which are available for a month and mainly independent productions — is censorship-related, but it is hard to ignore recent issues in China’s online content space.

Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks stores were closed down in China in April — again, without comment — just six months after launch. Then, less than a week after Apple’s about-turn, Disney’s video streaming service — DisneyLife — was shuttered barely five months after its launch on Chinese soil.
In the latter case, government involvement was suspected despite DisneyLife launching in partnership with Alibaba, the kind of partner most overseas firms would seek out for dealing with government-related issues. While Apple only said it hoped to relaunch the services “soon,” the New York Times reported that they were forced offline after an order from the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television.
TechCrunch has contacted Mubi for comment, but we haven’t received a response at the time of writing.
“Huanxi and MUBI have agreed to terminate the existing Framework Agreement, however we are still discussing other possible forms of cooperation for the future and both parties remain committed to a truly global vision,” Efe Cakarel, CEO and Founder, MUBI told TechCrunch in a statement.
“The company’s business plans and operations remain the same. We continue to pursue strong acquisitions as we have done in the past year, as well as continuing to develop new partnerships and focus on forthcoming productions,” he added.
Uncertainties around censorship, the existence of hugely popular rival video services, and the need to find a solid partner are among the reasons why Netflix is yet to roll out in China. The U.S. firm stunned the media industry when it launched in 130 new countries in one go in January, but China is notably one of just three countries on the planet where its service isn’t available today.
There has been plenty of speculation about whether the company would enter China. Netflix was reportedly in talks with Alibaba over a potential partnership, but that alliance seemed less likely after Alibaba launched its own subscription-based streaming service in China. Nonetheless, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has consistently said he is aiming to bring the service to Chinese shores: this news just made it clearer why the company — which has the added pressure of being a listed entity — is taking its sweet time over that.",2016-06-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/shutterstock_325058183.jpg?w=738,"china-streaming,media,china,mubi",Netflix alternative Mubi cancels plan to launch localized service in China

858,Jon Russell,"ClearTax, which helps Indians file their tax returns online with minimum stress, is on a roll this year. The Bengaluru-based company, which graduated Y Combinator two years ago, announced a $12 million Series A round today, just one month after closing a $2 million seed round following an initial $1.3 million raise.
ClearTax CEO and founder Archit Gupta told TechCrunch that three announcements over such a short period wasn’t the company’s plan, but that is how the funding materialized.
“It was not visible for us whether we could do a Series A so quickly,” he said in an interview. “2016 has been a year that is slow so we expected it to be more difficult.”
ClearTax counts Founders Fund, Sequoia and notable angels like PayPal founder Max Levchin, early WhatsApp exec Neeraj Arora and AngelList’s Naval Ravikant among its backers, but this new round was provided in its entirety by SAIF Partners. Gupta said that was down to the chemistry he found in SAIF’s Ravi Adusumalli.
The money is likely to last some time and will be used to help grow the ClearTax user base and expand its reach into new financial products.
“Even with 4x our current headcount, we won’t need more capital for three to four more years,” Gupta told us, adding that he anticipates that ClearTax can break even within the next two years. “We bootstrapped for three and a half years, we understand the value of money a lot.”
ClearTax is best known for its online tax service, which is far simpler and faster to use than the service offered by the government. More than one million Indians have filed tax returns using ClearTax, the company said, although that represents just a fraction of the estimated 60 million plus that will use other online services to file this year (India is pushing to make all tax filings online by 2016).
Beyond continuing to improve its core service and increase usage of it, ClearTax is also developing three new financial products to expand its reach.
First is a tax return service for businesses, which is focused around the Indian government move to evolve the country’s outdated and inconsistent VAT regulations to a more standardized GST system. The second is a business tax system for SMEs and independent contractors, which has been in beta for some time.
Finally, the company is building out a tax savings product that will bring the same idiot-proofing that has made ClearTax popular for tax returns to the space of investing. Citing that 60 percent of users are aged between 22 and 30, Gupta said he believes there’s plenty of space to educate the new generation of young professionals and workers on how best to use their money.
“They are worse at tax saving than any other demographic, [but] these tools and instruments to help them don’t exist in India — to me it feels incredibly frustrating,” Gupta (pictured below) explained.

The tax investment product is not unlike a U.S. 401K except that, while those in America must wait until they retire to access to capital, India’s lock-up period is far shorter, at between three to five years.
The idea is to provide information and choice to those who want to invest, while also removing inefficiencies in the process. ClearTax uses information already on file for a user — their tax and salary data — to match them with which of India’s top 20 funds are best for them and their financial situation. It takes a set percentage from an investment in any fund, which is labeled clearly for users to see. Gupta argued that it is a superior approach to brokers, who have “a strong bias for making the maximum commission” regardless of what is actually best for their client.
New products need new hires, of course, and the freshly raised capital will go in part toward increasing ClearTax’s headcount from the current 100 to 300 by the end of this year. Half of the new staff will be product engineers, Gupta explained, and the company is looking both inside India and to the U.S. — particularly Indian expats in Silicon Valley — to fill its vacancies. He added that the company is also open to making acqui-hires and acquisitions to bolster its ranks.
“Now we are starting to see small teams of technologists doing fintech now that it is ‘hot’ in India. If we see a team that is good and it makes sense for us, we’d be happy to explore that given that we have capital. [Overall,] it would really depend on the team,” Gupta said.
Note: An SEC filing reports that ClearTax has raised $24 million, however Gupta told TechCrunch that the information is erroneous and should read $12 million. The company said it is in the process of having the filing amended accordingly.",2016-06-17,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/tax.jpg?w=738,"india,fintech,tax,cleartax",India’s ClearTax raises $12M to expand into new financial services
859,Jon Russell,"China Life, Asia’s largest insurance firm, isn’t the only Uber investor to double dip and put money into its Chinese rival Didi Chuxing via its blockbuster $7.2 billion round announced this week. New York-based investment firm BlackRock also partook in the fundraising, which values Didi at $28 billion, a source close to the deal told TechCrunch.
BlackRock, which has $4.6 trillion in assets under management and offices in 30 countries, invested in Uber back in 2014 when the ride-sharing giant raised a then-unprecedented $1.2 billion. (Those were the days when such deals actually raised eyebrows.) Uber now covers over 200 cities worldwide, but it was in just 128 when BlackRook contributed (a reported) $215 million to its coffers.
Fast forward two years and things have changed, particularly in China, where Uber is investing billions. It’s hard to find reliable data on the ride-sharing market but Didi is generally acknowledged to be some way ahead of Uber in the country, despite China representing four of Uber’s top cities worldwide. Didi is also a thorn in Uber’s side outside of its native China. It has invested in Lyft, Ola in India and Southeast Asia’s Grab and is sharing best practices, linking the respective services for users and generally helping them fight Uber in their respective regions.
Uber China’s head believes the company can snag the top spot within the next twelve months, but some Uber investors aren’t taking that for granted and are putting money into arch nemesis Didi to hedge their bets.
China Life put $600 million into Didi’s new round — which also included Apple’s historic $1 billion investment — but our source was unable to verify the size of BlackRock’s contribution. Those two are not the only ones to have put money into both rival companies. China-based Hillhouse Capital and New York’s Tiger Global have invested in Didi and Uber, although both backed Didi first.
Didi doesn’t have international expansion plans, so investors are very much betting that it can lead the ride-sharing market in China, the land of more than a billion people. Li Zijian, senior director for international strategy at Didi, recently pegged the on-demand transportation industry in China to be worth $200 billion over the next five years. He added that Didi, which claims to be profitable in over 200 of its 400-plus cities in China, is taking just 1.1 percent of the whole market right now. That’s the growth opportunity that investors are bullish on.",2016-06-16,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/taxi-china.jpg?w=738,"ride-sharing-china,ride-sharing,blackrock,didi-chuxing",BlackRock is the latest Uber investor to back its fierce Chinese rival Didi Chuxing
860,Catherine Shu,"Samsung Electronics announced today that it has agreed to acquire cloud-computing company Joyent. In a statement, the Korean tech giant said that the transaction (its financial terms were undisclosed) will allow it to grow its cloud-based services for its smartphones and Internet-connected devices.
Joyent will become part of Samsung’s mobile communications unit, but continue to operate as a standalone company after the deal is finalized. Key members of its tech team, including CEO Scott Hammond, CTO Bryan Cantrill, and VP of product, Bill Fine, will work on Samsung’s cloud projects.
This is the third U.S. tech company that Samsung has bought in the last couple of years. The other two are smart home appliances maker SmartThings, and LoopPay, which developed the magnetic secure transmission (MST) technology that helps Samsung Pay compete against other mobile payment services like Apple Pay, as well as traditional credit cards.
Founded in 2004, Joyent has been positioned as an acquisition target for several years as peers like Virtustream, SoftLayer, and Metacloud were snapped up in a wave of mergers and acquisitions. Its main products, which help power mobile and web apps, include container infrastructure platform Triton and cloud-based object storage service Manta.

861,Catherine Shu,"Didi Chuxing, the largest ride-hailing app in China, confirmed today that it has closed a $7.3 billion financing round that includes its recent investments from Apple and China Life. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, whose sources say Didi Chuxing’s valuation is now pegged at more than $25 billion [the story has been updated to say $28 billion].
The company declined to comment on its reported valuation.
The round includes $4.5 billion in equity from Apple, China Life, Ant Financial, as well as returning investors Tencent, Alibaba, China Merchants Bank, and SoftBank. The remaining capital consists of $2.5 billion in debt financing from China Merchants Bank and a $300 million long-term debt investment from China Life, the country’s largest insurance company.
Didi Chuxing announced investments of $1 billion from Apple and $600 million from China Life a few weeks ago.
Apple’s contribution came as a surprise when it was revealed at the end of May and drew attention to Didi Chuxing’s dominance in China over Uber—but then Uber stole some of Didi Chuxing’s thunder by disclosing a whopping $3.5 billion investment—its largest so far—from the Saudi Arabian government’s main investment fund.
The competing funding news spotlights how gigantic Uber and Didi Chuxing’s war chests have become. Didi Chuxing said its latest financing round brings the total capital it has raised to $10.5 billion, which it claimed in a press release makes it “one of the world’s best-funded Internet companies.” Uber, which operates in about 70 countries, has raised even more. According to CrunchBase, the company has landed $14.11 billion in funding so far. Its current valuation is reportedly $62.5 billion.
In China, Didi Chuxing (which was founded by a merger of the country’s two-largest ride apps in 2015) has a wide lead over Uber. According to the China Internet Network Information Center, a government agency, Didi Chuxing currently holds a 87.2 percent share of China’s private-car hailing market. It claims to have 300 million registered users and 15 million drivers on its platform, who complete up to 14 million rides a day.
Uber, on the other hand, is spending $1 billion a year to build its China business (called Uber China). Founder and chief executive officer Travis Kalanick said in March that he believes Uber China will become profitable in two years.
During a media event in Beijing yesterday, Uber announced it will be available in 60 Chinese cities in July, and now completes about 30 million UberPool (which lets passengers share a car) rides each month in China.
The massive amount of cash each company is burning through in order to dominate China has led to speculation that Uber and Didi Chuxing may merge, but both companies have denied any interest in a union.
In a press statement, Didi Chuxing co-founder and CEO Cheng Wei said, “In just four years, Didi has created a firm lead in China’s mobile transportation sector. With our advantages in technology, platform synergies, and talented team, Didi is prepared to continue this momentum of growth.”",2016-06-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/traffic-in-china.jpg?w=738,"china,ride-sharing,didi-chuxing",Didi Chuxing completes $7.3B financing round that includes Apple’s $1B investment
862,Jon Russell,"Saavn, the music streaming service we’ve likened to ‘India’s Spotify’ in the past, has landed a notable strategic investor that could help it unlock more artists and business potential.
The startup, which is headquartered in New York with multiple offices in India, today announced an undisclosed investment from high-profile entertainment industry executive Guy Oseary, the man who manages U2, Madonna, and countless other top music acts.
Neither party has revealed how much Israel-born Oseary has invested nor the valuation of Saavn for the deal, but Saavn said that the CEO of Maverick, his talent agency which has grossed over 100 million sales for its artists, has joined as “a partner and investor.”
Nine-year-old Saavn raised a $100 million Series C funding round led by Tiger Global at a $300 to $400 million valuation last summer, and it claims to have more than 20 million tracks and over 14 million users. While it is primarily focused on India and Indian music, it claims users across 196 countries — who have the option of paying for a premium membership or using the free ad-supported alternative.
Despite decades in the entertainment business, Oseary isn’t a stranger to tech investments. He founded A-Grade Investments alongside actor Ashton Kutcher and billionaire Ronald Burkle, and together they have put money into the likes of Airbnb, Spotify, Soundcloud, Shazam and Uber. This deal is made in a personal capacity, however.
Oseary praised the potential impact of Saavn’s audience in India for musicians.
“Many artists would love for their music to reach India’s over one billion residents. From the time I’ve been in the music business, that process has always been too complicated; now, through Saavn, it is finally possible to have a true local partner in India that gets it, and will work hand-in-hand with artists and their managers,” he said in a statement.
Saavn CEO Rishi Malhotra said the union with Oseary would bring “unique artist collaborations that weren’t possible before” to the service.
“We’re building original programming for Saavn, now we’ll be developing unique content with artists. I can’t say exactly what the format will be right now, but it will developed exclusively or with an exclusive window,” he told TechCrunch in an interview.
On that note, Saavn isn’t just focused on music. The startup announced plans to enter video and other new content when it closed its Series A last year, and its first slate of podcasts were announced in April.
Malhotra further stressed that Saavn is aiming to build a bridge between the music and entertainment industries in India and the West.

863,Jon Russell,"Singapore-based Golden Gate Ventures has closed a new $60 million fund for Southeast Asia’s rapidly-growing startup ecosystem.
The firm first announced its new fund last summer, when it had closed an initial $35 million in capital from investors including Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek and Naver, the Korea-based owner of soon-to-go-public chat app Line. Now it has surpassed its original target of $50 million having added a range of new backers that include Korea’s Hanwha Life Insurance, Thailand’s Siam Commercial Bank, and Germany’s Hubert Burda Media.
Founded by ex-Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Vinnie Lauria, Jeffrey Paine and Paul Bragiel in 2012, Golden Gate Ventures began as a $10 million seed fund. It has since invested in over 30 companies across 10 countries via two funds, this latest being the second which has expanded its focus from seed into Series A, too.
“This is like we’ve done our Series B, we’ve matured as a fund,” Lauria, who founded and sold U.S. forum site Lefora with Bragiel before moving to Asia, told TechCrunch in an interview.
“There’s more confidence in ourselves in terms of the check sizes [and] we’ve gotten mentally stronger in terms of how we are approaching things. That’s just us growing up alongside the ecosystem,” he added.
Southeast Asia has gained increased exposure over the past year or so thanks to a series of deals that include Alibaba’s billion-dollar investment in e-commerce firm Lazada, the rise of Grab and its alliance with Lyft and other Uber rivals, and reports which show that the region — which has a cumulative population of over 600 million, 250 million of whom are currently internet users — is poised for massive growth in its digital economy.
Yet, Lauria — who discussed life as a U.S. VC in Southeast Asia with us earlier this year — insisted that raising this fund was no easy task, despite it being over-subscribed. Most of the fund’s LPs are Asia-based, and Golden Gate Ventures founding partner Lauria said there had been little interest from U.S.-based entities although European organizations were more aware of the region.
Some family offices in Europe “see this as a region with good financial returns and want to plug in with someone who can help,” he said. While others like Hubert Burda Media, which has put money into Vietnamese search firm Croc Coc and Bangkok-based Medial Departures, are “actively looking and keen to invest with someone who shares their philosophy,” Lauria observed.
Golden Gate Ventures has cut checks from the fund since announcing the first close, and the focus will continue to be on marketplaces, e-commerce and other internet services with “a consumer feel to them,” as was previously described to us, with capital split between seed, and larger deals and follow-on rounds.
Lauria said the additional $10 million raised will help Golden Gate Ventures write a few more larger checks than it had originally expected to, but there aren’t plans to massively ramp up further down the line.
“We love the early stage. If we do awesome, we’ll raise another fund that is in line with the market. But I want to be a small fund [that’s] nimble like a boutique [and attracts] startups because we are early stage and work much closer with them,” he said.
There’s much momentum for investing in Southeast Asia, where other new funds include B Capital from Saverin, which is backed by BCG and targeting a $250 million close, a $100 million fund from Jungle Ventures (which is also doubling down on seed-stage investing), and Venturra Capital’s $150 million fund, but Lauria doesn’t see fierce rivalries at this point.
“It isn’t so competitive that we are losing deals, but the landscape is large and competitive enough to invest in different ways,” he said. “If you’re a global investor thinking early stage internet, you’re not thinking Southeast Asia yet, but that will change, it’s a few years away.”
Last summer, around the time of the fund’s first close, Golden Gate Ventures issued a report that looked closely at Southeast Asia’s potential as a startup ecosystem. Its most recent release is focused on M&A and exit potential in the region.
The latest data from the firm suggests that startups in Southeast Asia have attracted $1.7 billion in investment capital this year alone, with VC funding doubling year-on-year. Though a large chunk of the 2016 to date cash came from Alibaba-Lazada, Golden Gate Ventures believes it is a sign of a hugely positive future.
“Despite the perceived difficulties in China affecting investor sentiment in the country, investment continues to flow into Southeast Asia,” it said in a statement.",2016-06-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/ggv-team-logo.jpg?w=738,"vinnie-lauria,southeast-asia,singapore,golden-gate-ventures",Golden Gate Ventures closes new $60 million fund for Southeast Asia
864,Abhijit Bose,"

While global stock markets reset and U.S. tech unicorns readjust to new expectations and valuations, India’s tech renaissance is just beginning to flourish.
Infosys founder Nandan Nilekani calls it India’s “WhatsApp Moment,” echoing how a simple software solution from Silicon Valley turned the Asian telecommunications industry upside down, making obsolete decades of infrastructure, business models and loyal customer relationships with massive telecom operators.
Just as WhatsApp surpassed all incumbent telecom operators in its messaging scale, financial technology is poised to become the next sector ripe for radical change. In this piece, I’ll explore how a single innovator could surpass the scale of all financial incumbents in all emerging markets combined.
Moreover, I’ll show how this disruption is different from other domestic leapfrog stories in India and China — because if it delivers as promised, India’s fintech revolution will have global repercussions, affecting all publicly traded banks and payment companies by the end of the decade.
Until now, India has been a place where low-cost services and “Fill-in-the-Blank of India” solutions have driven the technology market. While India’s unicorns have innovated successfully, they pose no threat to their international counterparts and competitors.
The Indian fintech story is different. The Indian government has a massive problem with an opaque, cash-based economy that has dominated the country for decades. With the majority of its citizens lacking access to formal banking services, India had nothing to lose by encouraging out-of-the-box innovation that would seem insane to the U.S. financial services establishment.
The only benefit of having poor infrastructure is that once in a generation — when people, policy and timing align — a country can reboot and leapfrog the developed world because there is no material incumbent investment or scale to protect. The fintech innovation in India today has been built completely outside the established “way of how things work,” and with minimal concern for which incumbents may suffer or go out of business as a result.
Ten years ago at my first startup in India, we spent a significant amount of time and resources worrying about how to approach customers who predominantly used SMS and bare-bones Symbian handsets. While the mobile internet user figures were superficially interesting, consumers weren’t really comfortable using the mobile internet as a replacement for offline transactions. Betting on mobile banking and payments 10 years ago was premature, and private sector velocity was hampered by a lot of environmental headwinds.
Today, the situation in India is much different. Google, Amazon and a set of private sector companies poised to launch 4G services next year have made a mobile-internet world not only a reality, but a certainty on which private sector companies and the country can base 10- to 20-year business models. India is now the world’s third largest market for smartphones and will reach 314 million mobile web users by 2017.
Today any company with a three- to five-year horizon can assume that every relevant target consumer will have access to a $40 smartphone connected to an ecosystem of thousands of mobile apps built and securely run on cloud-computing infrastructure. The maturation of India’s mobile network into a legitimate platform for software services on par with the U.S. is critical to why India’s fintech story is happening now after a decade of promise.
Over the last 24 months, the government has made financial inclusion and transparency a stated priority — and there is proactive policy and pressure to empower the private sector to help deliver results. A favorable regulatory stance from the Reserve Bank of India, coupled with the Indian Prime Minister’s “Jan Dhan Yojana” (financial inclusion for the masses) program, are working to bring all citizens onto the financial grid at unprecedented velocity and scale. As a result:
After decades of slow innovation and investment from public and private sector banks, India also granted a slew of new banking licenses this year to promote competition, expansion and faster deployment of new digital services. What was interesting is that most of these banking licenses were not given to traditional banks, but primarily telecom, software and IT services companies — most of whom have a strong track record of scaling by dramatically lowering operating costs and disrupting existing business models.
The “spark” that will unleash the WhatsApp-like disruption is the “India Tech Stack,” a unique suite of API-based services that lift the veil off every major government-mandated customer service. The first was India’s Unique Identification through which any person can be identified with a simple biometric check using commercial handsets.
The second major leg of the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) was launched last month by Raghuram Rajan (Reserve Bank of India Governor), Nandan Nilekani and the head of almost every major bank in India. UPI is a platform through which any person can transfer money to another person’s bank account or financial instrument of choice by knowing their mobile phone number. Moreover, the underlying technology has been exposed as a service to the entire app developer ecosystem.
The implications are huge, as it democratizes all of the IP and infrastructure that made financial and government systems proprietary, unnecessarily bloated and difficult for startups to reinvent.
PayPal, Square and Apple Pay are visions of the future, but ultimately still conform to the old walls of financial services. Imagine an interoperable world where any app built by two college kids could allow you to move money at no cost from one bank account to another. Whichever app delivered the most utility would own the value and marketshare… the exact way that WhatsApp won. In the four weeks since UPI’s launch, I have seen dozens (and soon to be hundreds) of apps built by small teams that will have the power and capability of PayPal on steroids.
The last time a single core technology was exposed in an open-manner like this was when the U.S. government opened GPS in 2000. The result a decade later was Uber, Google Maps and driverless cars.
India has exposed six core technologies: UID, UPI, eKYC, Mobile-based Digital Signature, Digital Locker (which eliminates the need to submit a paper document after the first time) and Digital Consent (which allows people to easily, transparently and securely make their profile and transaction data available to third-parties for services). In combination, these real-time digital services will enable startups to digitize and simplify everything from bank account creation to border security, from voting and subsidy distribution to tax filing and refunds across the world.
The fact that the payments infrastructure in the West has existed for so long (and is pretty good) has actually had a dampening effect on the adoption of digital payments technologies. People in the West still overwhelmingly use credit cards when checking out in retail stores, even if they could pay on their phone. Why? Because whipping out a credit card is pretty painless, so there is not much incentive to change behavior. In Asia, consumer behavior is changing rapidly and consumers are already leapfrogging traditional forms of payments to use mobile.
If the India experiment works, the U.S. would have to seriously consider adopting the “India Stack,” and if it does, entire layers of the financial service technology and business stack will become either obsolete or commoditized, moving the value to mobile software companies and non-traditional banking units.
Banks that you grew up with would become commoditized and replicable using open services; your telecom operator or Facebook could become your bank. Billion-dollar hardware and processing companies will become obsolete or go out of business, like what happened with Nokia, Lucent and AT&T.
Not only will the United States and Europe be importing disruptive technology and business models from Mother India, but also, instead of Amazon and Uber attacking Indian or Chinese markets, Bank of America, TurboTax and PayPal may be fighting off battle-tested and efficient Asian product companies that could become the dominant players in the U.S. Now that’s a revolution.",2016-06-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/bankclosed.jpg?w=738,"raghuram-rajan,banking,fintech,india",India’s fintech revolution is primed to put banks out of business
865,Jon Russell,"PromisePay, an Australia-headquartered fintech startup that specializes in payments for online marketplaces, has raised $10 million in fresh capital for growth.
We wrote about the company when it landed $2 million nearly a year ago, and this latest round is comprised of a number of strategic investors. Australia’s Carsales led the financing, with participation from Australian VC funds Rampersand and Reinventure, and existing backers U.S.-based Cultivation Capital and Mark Harbottle, co-founder of logo marketplace 99Designs (another notable Australian tech name.)
Founded in 2014, PromisePay targets new digital commerce platforms, such as online marketplaces, where the risk of fraud or disagreement is higher than more traditional online commerce. The startup, which graduated St. Louis’ SixThirty fintech accelerator, claims over 40 customers in Australia and the U.S., including 99Designs-owned web and app marketplace Flippa, home renovation service Hipages and Taskrabbit-like Airtasker.
PromisePay co-founder and CEO Simon Lee explained to TechCrunch in an interview that, beyond facilitating payment, the startup manages fraud on both the seller and buyer’s side, provides support for buyers, and resolves disputes so e-commerce sites “don’t have to worry about payments and can just focus on their business.”
In the case of fraud, he explained that PromisePay takes on the financial risk for each transaction, which makes its credibility checks on both sides hugely important. When there is a first-time buyer or seller, PromisePay runs a real-time check using a mixture of signals such as social media, device diagnostics, email and more to establish credibility. (Similar to Southeast Asia’s FinAccel which we recently wrote about.)
“There are thousands of platforms looking to create fast, simple and trusted payments between buyers and sellers that don’t know each other. It’s a great deal more complex than just a payment, it’s an entire experience, and our technology delivers that experience seamlessly for platforms all over the world, and with full protection to all parties,” Lee said in a statement.
“Theres a fundamental shift in payments, everything is moving online, Uber is a good example of that. These types of platforms are a little more complicated than just taking a credit card for payment,” co-founder and Chief Experience Officer Darren McMurtrie added.
PromisePay claimed its revenue grew 25 percent per month over the past year, although it didn’t provide a raw figure for sales. It has been on a hiring spree with its staff, which is spread across Australia, the U.S. and Philippines, jumping from 35 to 75. Lee said that figure is likely to reach 140 next year.
“The great thing about Australian startups is that we bootstrap,” Lee explained. “U.S. companies can burn through $40 million in two years but we can make $10 million last four years.”
Beyond general growth, Lee and McMurtrie — CTO Simon Jones is the third founding member — said the company is weighing up whether to expand its focus into new verticals, or go after business in new geographies outside of Australia and the U.S..
For now, landing Carsales, Australia’s largest online car site, which is listed on the ASX, and other strategic investors is proof for the founders that they are on the right track.
“They went out to the market and settled on our platform,” Lee said. “They see the digital landscape is changing and that payments will be an important part of the story.”
“We searched extensively for a provider that could bring trusted payments to our marketplaces, and PromisePay was uniquely able to do so. We immediately saw value not just for our own business but for countless other platforms. So not only will we be using PromisePay but we’re also delighted to be an investor in PromisePay,” Carsales founder and CEO Greg Roebuck added in a statement.",2016-06-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/wallet-amex.jpg?w=738,"cultivation-capital,carsales-com,australia,promisepay","Australia’s PromisePay, a payment platform for online marketplaces, raises $10M"
866,Jon Russell,"Baidu, China’s dominant search company, has lowered its revenue expectation for its current quarter of business by around 10 percent following a scandal around its medical industry advertising partners.
Chinese authorities opened an investigation into the company earlier this month after it emerged that a 21-year-old student who died of cancer had borrowed over $30,000 to finance an unsuccessful treatment that he found advertised on Baidu’s search engine. It is unclear if the medical treatment was misleading, but Baidu was criticized by many in China — including state-run media People’s Daily — for making money from health cases.
Beyond creating negative headlines, the controversy has weighed on Baidu’s business. The firm said today that it has reduced its estimated revenue range for Q2 2016 to RMB18.100 billion ($2.807 billion) to RMB18.200 billion ($2.823 billion) from an original target of RMB20.110 billion ($3.119 billion) to RMB20.580 billion ($3.192 billion).
That adjustment is due to lower interest from advertisers during the government review of its search engine, which is estimated to have more than 80 percent marketshare in China.
“While the review is underway, the Company has observed a reduction or delay in spend from a significant portion of medical customers,” Baidu said. “These customers may be in the process of receiving instruction from regulatory authorities, gathering and submitting required documentation and adjusting their practices to comply with new regulations.”
Baidu expects its business to rebound over time but, for now, it has also lowered the number of sponsored links that appear within the search engine.
“This measure impacts revenue over the short term but enhances user experience and will drive benefit to Baidu over the long term,” it added in a note to investors.
Baidu chairman and CEO Robin Li echoed that sentiment in a longer statement:
Nasdaq-listed Baidu’s share price fell as low as $150.50 in after-hours trading after closing at $163.55 at the end of trading on Monday. It since recovered to $154.75 at the time of writing.",2016-06-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_9812.jpg?w=738,"investigation,search,baidu,china",Baidu slashes revenue forecast as government probes its medical advertising business
867,Catherine Shu,"Alibaba Group’s goal is to become the equivalent of the world’s fifth-richest country in four years. Founder and chairman Jack Ma laid out the company’s ambitions during its first Investor Day, which took place this morning at its headquarters in Hangzhou, China.
In order to do that, Alibaba will have to more than double the $463 billion in gross merchandise value it made last fiscal year. Achieving one trillion dollars in GMV by 2020 would make the Alibaba the equivalent of the world’s fifth-largest country by gross domestic product, Ma claimed, after the United States, China, the European Union, and Japan.
E-commerce alone, however, will not be enough to take it that far. Ma told investors that Alibaba’s growth strategy revolves around Aliyun, its cloud computing and big data unit. In fact, Alibaba “is not a retail business, we are a data business,” he said, and everything it does now—including financial services like Alipay and investing in logistics—is to gather yet more data.
But Alibaba is still pumping a lot of money into e-commerce (for example it recently invested $1 billion into Lazada to build its online retail business in Southeast Asia), even as it focuses on big data, and investors have worried about how the impact on its profits.
Ma admitted that “we don’t know how to make money off data today, but we know nobody can live without data in the future.” He also cautioned that its shift in strategy means Alibaba Group should not be judged solely on GMV because the metric—which is how revenue for e-commerce companies is measured and compared—will become increasingly outdated as it moves beyond its marketplaces.
“Fifteen years ago, I had a problem with my venture capitalist investors. They kept asking, in 2001, 2002, what is your revenue, what are your page views? At that time page views was the business model, then click rate was the business model,” Ma said.
“Then in 2005, we started giving something called GMV that we learned from eBay. Investors needed it so we gave it to them and it became standard. But in our heart, we know this is not the only index,” he added.
Saving Alibaba’s international reputation
Alibaba’s goal is to serve two billion people by 2020. This means it needs to quickly expand beyond China, which has a population of about 1.36 billion. Ma says he expects about 30 percent of Chinese consumers will never use Alibaba’s services, so it has to find 1.2 billion users in other countries.
In addition to Southeast Asia, Alibaba is also eyeing India and has made major investments in e-commerce companies like Paytm. Alibaba has struggled to establish a foothold in the U.S., however (its Amazon competitor, 11 Main, closed in June 2015 just one year after it began operating). Despite opening data centers in the U.S., Aliyun is likely to run into similar problems as it goes up against AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.
Talking about Alibaba’s U.S. prospects put Ma on the defensive. “People ask, ‘Jack, are you frustrated and upset by the stock price?’ Yes and no,” he said.
“I can understand because we are a company from China and we are doing something that nobody has done before in history and very, very few people have used our service in America. Good things always take time and patience.”
Alibaba also has to fight its reputation for enabling counterfeiters if it wants to woo customers outside of China. The company is the constant target of reprimands from the U.S. and Chinese governments. Both have complained that Alibaba does not do enough to prevent IP theft.
Despite that, Ma claimed during his speech that Alibaba is the “world’s leading fighter of counterfeiting” and that its anti-counterfeiting measures have put 700 people in prison over the last three years and led to the closure of “millions of shops.”
Fighting against knockoffs is “fighting against human nature,” Ma added. Furthermore, thanks to the large number of original equipment manufacturers in China, many fake goods are “better quality and better price than the real ones.”
He insisted that Alibaba is also a victim. For every fake product sold on its platform, Alibaba loses five customers.
“I promise that we are more and more confident than ever that we can solve the problem. We cannot solve the problem 100 percent because we are fighting against human nature,” he said. “But we can solve the problem better than any government, any organization, anyone in the world.”",2016-06-14,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/466480018.jpg?w=738,"china,jack-ma,alibaba-group",Jack Ma says Alibaba wants to more than double its GMV to one trillion dollars by 2020
868,Jon Russell,"Carro, a Singapore-based online marketplace for buying and selling cars, has landed $5.3 million to expand its service across Southeast Asia.
This Series A round was led by Indonesia’s Venturra Capital, from its $150 million fund, with participation from Singtel Innov8, Golden Gate Ventures, Alpha JWC Ventures, Skystar Capital and GMO Venture Partners among others. All in all, Carro — which only launched in November 2015 — said it has welcomed ten different investors from across Indonesia, Singapore, Japan and China.
That mix of partners is designed to enable the service to expand into more markets in Southeast Asia this year. Aaron Tan, Carro’s CEO and a former investor with Singtel Innov8, explained that the company is already proactively making inroads into Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia with a view to being present in all three by the end of 2016. Carro plans to hire local staff to run each country business much like a founder, rather than shipping expats in, he explained.
There are plenty of classifieds that help car owners sell their vehicles online, but Carro aims to stand out from the crowd with a services-focused offering. That’s to say that it doesn’t simply focus on sales, it has a useful service for calculating the price and likely time to sell a vehicle — a nice hook to nab potential sellers — a virtual showroom option for dealers, a consumer-to-consumer marketplace and, as of today, ‘Carro Workshop,’ an app that helps car owners find workshops for services — mandatory and otherwise — as required.

The company also works with the leasing, insurance and warranty industries to offer preferred rates to customers. Aside from the commission fees it takes when it sells a partner’s package, it draws money from each transaction that it enables. Unlike others, it doesn’t charge a standing subscription fee to dealers or others in the auto industry.
This suite of services is operation in Singapore but for new market expansions Carro may tailor its offerings according at launch, Tan explained.
Looking forward to next year, the Carro CEO admits that the company will have to decide whether to continue its focus on Southeast Asia, a nascent but high-potential digital market with over 600 million consumers, or battle for marketshare in more established Western markets.
“If we win those [new expansion] markets do we double down on Southeast Asia, going into Vietnam, Myanmar and other major markets in the region, or look to Japan, the UK and other big countries?” he said.
For now there is no answer, and that further expansion would require a Series B round for financing. Though there is plenty of competition for consumer attention, Tan and the 20-plus team at Carro say they aren’t losing sleep over car sales sites in Southeast Asia like iCar Asia, which has been on an acquisition spree, or Rocket Internet-backed Carmudi.
“Classified sites are more like channels,” he said. “We use them to promote [our own sales.] When you look at classifieds versus marketplaces, [there’s] not that much in terms of competition.”
Carro said gross revenue on its platform, which it claims is increasing at a 30 percent rate month-on-month, is “on track” to reach $100 million this year.
As you might expect for a startup in Southeast Asia, Tan said that some three-quarters of Carro’s traffic comes from mobile. However, with tens of thousands of dollars in purchases at stake, mobile tends to be for browsing with most consumers preferring to buy on a tablet or laptop after doing more research before parting with their hard-earned cash.",2016-06-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/screenshot-2016-06-13-19-02-52.png?w=738,"singtel-innov8,southeast-asia,golden-gate-ventures,venturra-capital",Carro lands $5.3M to expand its car sales and services platform in Southeast Asia
869,Ingrid Lunden,"The market for augmented and virtual reality technology continues to heat up, and now one of the more promising startups making both AR hardware and software has raised a $50 million round to keep up the pace.
Meta, which makes an AR headset/glasses of the same name, as well as software to run on it, has raised $50 million in a Series B round of funding. The company plans to use the money to continue building out its technology, developing apps, expanding into new markets like China, and working on the next generation of its headset, the Meta 3 — according to a short statement announcing the round. The news comes just ahead of the E3 gaming conference kicking off this week, where we may see yet more AR and VR news emerge.
(You can see our review of the Meta 2, released earlier this year, here.)
This latest round includes investments from Horizons Ventures Limited (which led its $23 million Series A round), as well as a list that includes several strategic backers with several specifically out of China: Lenovo, Tencent, Banyan Capital, Comcast Ventures, and GQY.
Meta is not disclosing its valuation, but filing documents provided to us by VC Experts points to a valuation of up to $307 million post-money for this latest round (the actual valuation depends on how many of the authorized preferred as well as common shares were issued). The Series B originally started as a $40 million round and then expanded before it closed.
Meta was founded in 2012 and is based out of Redwood City, but also has an R&D operation in Israel, where its founders hail from originally.
Many VR and AR companies tend to focus on the software end of the spectrum, developing content and technology to produce more engaging and realistic (and potentially less nauseating) experiences not just for smartphones and other screens but newer products like the Oculus Rift, Samsung VR and HTC Vive — devices that appear to be taking a lead in this still-nascent market to tap into more immersive games and other consumer media, as well as more practical enterprise applications.
Some of the most interesting of that group of software startups are getting snapped up by companies that want to make a mark in this area.
Meta is taking a different route: a vertically integrated approach in which it is using its own software development (which is heavy on computer vision, machine learning, and AI based on neuroscience) that works on hardware of its own design, which lets you immerse yourself in virtual situations that are embedded in real environments, giving you the ability to manipulate the virtual elements with gestures and other hand movements.
Taking the vertical route a road less travelled, but not entirely unpopulated. In addition to the likes of Facebook-owned Oculus, apparently Magic Leap — which is still in stealth but nonetheless valued at $4.5 billion after its last round — is also building its AR approach end-to-end, and from the ground up.
Interestingly, the investors think that Meta, despite its far more modest fundraising, could give Magic Leap a run for its money.
“In our view, Meta has built a world-class team,” said Bin Yue, Founding Partner of Banyan Capital, in a statement. “Meta is probably the only startup which has the capabilities to compete with giant companies’ projects like Microsoft Hololens and Magic Leap.”
Back when Meta was more of an idea than a publicly available product, I met Meron Gribetz, Meta’s CEO, for a demo of its prototypes and saw that he had an incredibly focused and singular vision of how he wanted to develop the company. The headset they were working on, he said at the time, was something they wanted to be easy enough to use that it could be attainable by the mass market. That was years ago, and so it’s great to see them coming along so far.
“It is incredibly gratifying to have the support of big thinkers and investors who understand the importance of creating a new human-computer interface, anchored in science. Our… investors really get what we’re doing and why Meta is different from the other players in AR,” he said in a statement today. “They understand that the combination of our advanced optical engines along with our neuroscience-based interface design approach are what will create a computing experience that is 100 times easier to use and more powerful than traditional form factors.”
Meta’s funding is a sign of how investors are keen to get in early in what is still far from a mainstream industry, but also a mark of how no one is quite sure which way it will develop.
“Augmented reality represents a transformational platform for communication, collaboration and how individuals will work in the future,” said Michael Yang, Managing Director at Comcast Ventures, in a statement. “Meta’s platform enables a host of new ways to conduct business across a wide array of industries. We look forward to supporting Meta as our first investment in the AR market.”
While several of the investors in this round are based out of China, the GQY involvement in particular will see Meta making some significant inroads to China.
“Through the investment in Meta, GQY is looking to bring the best-in-class Augmented Reality applications to China,” said Jier Yuan, VP, North America, GQY, in a statement. “This goal will be achieved by leveraging Meta’s leading-edge AR hardware, software and GQY’s in-depth knowledge and relationships in industrial training, public transportation and education sectors in China.”

870,Anthony Ha,"Weebly launched a new version of its platform today.
While the company started out as an easy-to-use website creator and editor (I used it to build my own website), CEO David Rusenko said that with Weebly 4, “We feel like for the first time we’re past a website builder — it’s something substantially different.”
To be clear, the website editor is still a core part of the experience, but Rusenko said the biggest improvements this time around were on the e-commerce side. Those improvements include abandoned cart functionality (allowing stores to message customers when they leave without completing their purchase), as well as a rebuilt engine for calculating taxes in different cities and countries, plus real-time shipping prices (most of the time, apparently, stores are just estimating what the shipping will cost rather than pulling the most recent data from the shipping companies’ APIs).
Rusenko argued that Weebly is now strong enough to compete against e-commerce platforms like Shopify, but in his view, the product’s real strength is the way it ties the website, e-commerce and recently-added email marketing features together. For example, businesses edit their online storefront using the same interface as they do to build their website. Or when they’re adding new items to that storefront, Weebly can prompt them to send out an automated email highlighting the just-added products, and then it gives them a report on how many sales that email actually drove.


“We have customers doing many millions of dollars a year in sales on our the platform who are very happy with it,” Rusenko said. “But a lot of those people, where our e-commerce platform in the past was reaching its limits, this extends it out.”
He also noted that the new features all work on mobile, and they’re further complemented by third-party integrations available through the Weebly App Center.",2016-09-21,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/2016_01_23_weebly_45251web.jpg?w=738,"website-builders,david-rusenko,weebly",Weebly updates its website builder with a focus on e-commerce and marketing
871,Anthony Ha,"Things are looking up for adtech companies on Wall Street — or at least for one of them.
The Trade Desk debuted on NASDAQ today at a price of $28.75 per share, up nearly 60 percent from its IPO price of $18. And while there wasn’t a dramatic pop, it continued to climb and closed the day at $30.10 per share.
That’s a good start, particularly considering that adtech companies have struggled recently on the public markets, which has made venture capitalists wary of the industry, as well.
Ventura, Calif.-headquartered The Trade Desk, which offers tools for ad buyers, was probably helped by its financials — the company is profitable, with 2015 revenue more than doubling year-over-year, to $113.8 million.
Chief Client Officer Brian Stempeck told me that investors are also warming again to the possibilities of programmatic ad technology (where ads are bought in an automated fashion, usually in real time).
“This is a $640 billion industry that is in the very early stages of transforming,” Stempeck said. “It’s a pretty unique moment — industries don’t transform like this more than once.”

Looking ahead, Stempeck said The Trade Desk will continue to expand internationally while also building more products for programmatic buying of TV ads. After all, he noted that while most ad dollars are going to TV, most TV advertisers don’t have a way to learn how many times they’ve shown someone the same ad.
“Advertisers can actually show fewer ads, they can be better targeted, the publisher or content owner gets a higher rate because it’s so targeted, and it’s a better experience for the consumer” because they aren’t bombarded repeatedly with the same ad, Stempeck said.",2016-09-21,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/money-arrows.png?w=738,"ipos,adtech",The Trade Desk finishes strong at $30.10 per share after its first day on NASDAQ
872,Steven Hillion,"

If you go by the latest headlines, the data scientist is the most coveted and scarce enterprise commodity on the employment market. But you could just as easily argue that it’s a trendy title that has not nearly lived up to the hype — and could eventually be automated out of a job.
According to a recent McKinsey Global Survey, 86 percent of executives said their organizations have been “at best only somewhat effective in meeting the primary objective of their data and analytics programs,” and one-quarter said they’ve been “ineffective.” Less than four years after being named the “sexiest job of the 21st century,” it’s time to confront some cold, hard realities. Data scientists are both extremely important and set up to fail unless they adapt to a new model for delivering value.
Recently, I was invited by the UC Berkeley School of Information to host a conversation with students and alums on the real-world applications of data science. During the Q&A, my favorite question was whether I thought software like ours at Alpine Data might eventually replace the data scientist all together. My answer at the time was “no,” more or less: Data science will always be something of an art.
You need to intimately understand the problems that can be solved by data science first, which involves a very human process of interacting with the business. Crafting models will always require the subtle translation of real-world phenomena into mathematical expressions. And there is a human element to interpreting and presenting results that would be difficult to automate.
But it’s still true that, over time, more aspects of a data scientist’s work will be done by software. Feature generation has already become less important as models become more sophisticated. Model parameter selection will become increasingly automated — model deployment entirely so. It seems inevitable that the job description is going to evolve.
Consider how the work of the software engineer has changed fundamentally in the last 20 years. They no longer need to write their own logging module or database access layer or UI widget. And agile methods have brought the “customer” more immediately into the development process. More and more, the job of the engineer is to stitch together higher-level components and collaborate with product managers and UX designers.
Similarly, the job of the data scientist will be to take advantage of pre-built components in order to solve a greater variety of business problems. Instead of a few six-month analytics projects that focus on model accuracy and algorithmic niceties, business and analytics teams will be able to work on hundreds of projects that emphasize making concrete changes in the way business is done. And as the software available for analytics becomes more powerful, the result should be a continued steady demand for data scientists, playing a different but more prominent role in the day-to-day working of an organization.
But this shift isn’t happening nearly as fast as it should. Why? Time and again, the No. 1 failure point I see is that data scientists are mired in technical details, and not connecting analytics to business action. While it seems obvious to engage with business teams — “the business guys defined the scope; isn’t that enough?” — far too often big data projects get lost in the weeds of the science, statistics and technology. As a result, it is very easy for data science teams to lose sight of whether, and how, data science is actually solving real-world business problems.
In a recent conversation with a large financial organization, I was told that it typically took six months to deploy a new model. Why? Ask your analytics management about their everyday work and you’ll get a depressing list of technical minutiae, clustered around the data platforms (“we can’t connect to the CRM database” or “we’re waiting for the security on the cluster to be upgraded”), the math (“we need our own version of hierarchical models that can handle a million variables” or “we think we can get greater accuracy if we use neural networks”) and the deployment (“we have a separate team of engineers who manually convert the R scripts into SQL”).
There is a satisfaction with the status quo that can often be challenged by simply asking, “What would stop you from deploying a good-enough model tomorrow?”
The reality is that data scientists have more power than they think to affect and lead the change that’s needed. The most successful data science teams I know operate like agile software development teams. The focus is on rapid deployment followed by additional rounds of incremental improvement. They realize that analytics is not an objective addressed by a single project, but rather an ongoing organizational process — with a clear methodology that seeks to continually improve performance — that may serve a number of business objectives over time.
While adopting a process may seem at odds with practicing the “art” of data science, the reality is that there’s been far too much data science art and not enough action. Those days are now over. The artistic qualities will remain, but the work will deliver far more value and will find itself impacting far more people, far more frequently during a given day. So maybe the role of data scientist will no longer be the sexiest job, but rather the most powerful.",2016-09-21,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/toughitguys.jpg?w=738,data-scientists,Data scientists need to swap sex appeal for power
873,Sarah Buhr,"Several folks started noticing self-driving Uber cars in downtown San Francisco yesterday, fueling speculation the ridesharing company could soon be deploying autonomous vehicles for commercial use right where it all started in the Bay Area.
Mattermark editor in chief Alex Wilhelm snapped a picture of a white Ford Fusion stopped at the intersection of Montgomery and Pacific.
And, as first reported by Business Insider, Mercury Public Affairs senior vice president Drew Olanoff caught a black self-driving car making a left turn on Market Street near the Embarcadero at 6:45 a.m.
Other startup workers have been mentioning the sightings in the downtown area on social media as well, igniting suspicions this isn’t a one-off test.
These self-driving cars seen in downtown SF seem to be the same as those used in Uber’s self-driving pilot program in Pittsburgh. Uber recently deployed a fleet of 14 Ford Fusions equipped with radar, cameras and other sensing equipment developed by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University’s robotics center.
Pittsburgh Uber users are now able to opt in to hailing one of these 14 autonomous vehicles in town. But an Uber spokesperson tells TechCrunch that’s not the case with the self-driving cars spotting in SF.
“A handful of cars equipped with advanced driver safety and self-driving technology are now being tested in the Bay Area. These are for internal research use only. They will have a test driver upfront and will not be part of our ridesharing service. Testing in different environments is critical to the future success of this technology, which will help dramatically improve road safety,” Uber said.
So how long until riders here can choose to try out one of Uber’s self-driving cars? Uber said it didn’t have a timeline but did add it would keep us posted. We’ll be sure to let you know as soon as we hear more.",2016-09-21,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/uber-self-driving-car.jpg?w=738,"transport,crowdsourcing,software,ford",Self-driving Uber vehicles spotted on the streets of San Francisco
874,Haje Jan Kamps,"As any eBay, Etsy or Shopify seller will tell you, if you’re selling stuff online, photography is up there with the top most important parts of your sales listing. And yet, there’s a load of sellers who are great at making doo-dahs, gizmos and wotsits but who post photos that are, frankly, embarrassing. Orangemonkie fixes that with smart and easy-to-use lightboxes and turntables, making photography fool-proof for online sellers.
How important is it? Very. In fact, Shopify itself is including Orangemonkie’s Foldio in its Stockroom — the company’s collection of products “to help you start your business.”
Orangemonkie’s Foldio360 is a Bluetooth-driven turntable controlled via a smartphone app. You can either use the smartphone itself to take the photos, or a supported SLR camera. Given how good smartphones are these days and how tremendously easy to use Orangemonkie’s app is, it hardly seems worth it to bother with the fancier cameras.
The one exception I can think of is if you prefer to use studio flashes or a strobist-style photography setup. If you do have a hankering for a bit of SLR action, you’ve got to admire the company’s solution. Triggering the camera is done via the IR receiver used for the remote control on most cameras. The turntable itself has an IR transmitter and the app tells the turntable which signals to send. Ingenious, because it means the company can add additional camera compatibility with a software update.
Foldio360 is available for pre-order now on its own for $119, or for $194 including the additional softbox/lighting kit. It was originally a half-million-dollar Kickstarter campaign, and Daniel Kim, the company’s marketing manager, assures me that the Kickstarter backers are receiving their turntables in the post as we speak. For orders placed now, the company expects to ship later this month.
Foldio2, Orangemonkie’s softbox, is available to order now for $75.

875,John Mannes,"Imagine for a moment that you’re riding in one of John Zimmer’s proposed autonomous sleeper cars and you’re fast asleep on a road trip across the state. All of the sensors on the vehicle are collecting data so that standard components like the engine and steering systems don’t kill you. At sub-second intervals, some believe your car could generate nearly a gigabyte of driving data every second. That means a single eight-hour road trip results in 28 terabytes of data. All of this data has to be tracked, managed, and analyzed. Traditional database solutions like Oracle and SQL are just not cut out for the job.
With new capital, InfluxData wants to set themselves up as the go to solution for this compounding problem. The company just closed a $16 million Series B led by Battery Ventures with participation from Mayfield, Trinity Ventures and Bloomberg Beta, to bankroll expansion efforts focused on marketing and customer acquisition.
In more specific terms, InfluxData deals with the nasty problem of what’s called time-series data. Traditional SQL databases can quickly become bloated and overwhelmed when tasked with doing continuous queries in real-time. Reliable technology that supports the construction of custom monitoring tools is hard to come by and is only becoming more in vogue with time.

This is important because it’s not just autonomous cars generating a bone crushing amount of data. Commercial internet of things solutions monitoring things like the pressure in water pipes and seismic data in oil fields are also breaking traditional databases for storing and analyzing time-series data.
InfluxData knows it’s not the only game in town. SaaS solutions like Datadog can serve a similar purpose in addition to more general time-series database solutions like KairosDB.
“We want those SaaS providers to use us underneath,” said Evan Kaplan, CEO of InfluxData.
The value proposition of InfluxData’s core platform, InfluxDB, is that it’s designed for people to write on top of it. The platform has been implemented across nearly 40,000 unique sites.
Today the technology is powering solutions at companies like Nordstrom, eBay, and Solar City. Mozilla has implemented InfluxDB for DevOps so that the company can have access to performance metrics on the Firefox browser in real-time.
“What’s special about InfluxDB is that it’s easy to consume,” said Dharmesh Thakker, a partner at Battery Ventures who will be joining the InfluxData board. “It shouldn’t take days and months to set up or people lose interest.”
Notably, InfluxDB is an open source technology. This means it hasn’t directly supported revenue growth, but it has helped to build out a developer community in a relatively short period of time. With a community built out, and the company’s TICK stack built out to service the collection, storage, visualization, and processing of time-series data, additional monetization opportunities are emerging. InfluxEnterprise, the company’s commercial clustering product, even further reduces the time necessary to deploy and scale. Similar paid products that sit on top of InfluxDB will power the company into the future.",2016-09-21,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-527031096.jpg?w=738,"influxdb,database,oracle-database",InfluxData closes $16 million Series B led by Battery Ventures to organize IOT data
876,Lora Kolodny,"Gametime has raised $20 million in venture funding for an app that allows people to find and buy tickets to a nearby concert or sporting event at the last minute, and even up to a half-hour after a game begins.
Evolution Media Partners led Gametime’s Series B round, joined by GV, Stanford’s StartX Fund, Accel Partners, Casey Wasserman and Jeff Mallett.
The funding brings Gametime’s total capital raised to $33 million to-date.
Founded by Brad Griffith in 2013, Gametime has steadily added tickets from more professional sports teams and to a wider variety of events over the years. It sells tickets from both primary sources and resellers.
The startup has also rolled out features and video advertising to attract millennial sports and music fans.
For example, Gametime’s Snap and Sell feature lets users take a photo of a paper-based ticket to list it on their marketplace, and price it automatically.
And Gametime Connect allows app users to find and follow friends, see the events for which they’re purchased tickets, or have tickets to sell, then buy one to go along.
To promote its Connect feature, Gametime created a video spot that quickly racked up over 4 million views on Facebook, driving thousands of transactions for the company.
The campaign helped Gametime stand out in a market rife with competition.
Gametime is up against longstanding marketplaces like Ticketmaster and Ticketweb (both owned by Live Nation), Stubhub and its parent company Ebay, Pandora-owned Ticketfly, and private equity and venture backed players like Vivid Seats, SeatGeek and Applauze.
The startup, which now employs about 65 full-time in San Francisco, estimates that the “last-minute” segment already represented some $7.5 billion in North American ticket sales last year.
Colin Evans, Gametime’s Chief Revenue Officer and a founding employee of Stubhub, said he predicts this segment will grow, thanks to the fact that consumers, especially 18-34 year olds, are increasingly purchasing via smartphones and on-the-go.
Griffith added that stadiums’ adoption of mobile instead of paper tickets has also helped drive the trend, and Gametime’s growth.
Virtually all stadiums and professional sports teams now accept mobile tickets, he said, and many smaller music venues that you would not expect to be technologically advanced do as well.
According to PriceWaterhouse Coopers, the North American market for sports tickets sold from primary sources is projected to grow to $20.1 billion by 2019. And according to Pollstar, the North American concert business saw sales hit $3.12 billion just across the top 100 tours in 2015.
Early Gametime investor Jeff Mallett, a part-owner of the San Francisco Giants and former Yahoo executive, said he expects the startup to use its new funding for hiring, and to build new event discovery features for ticket buyers, and tools for ticket suppliers.
Mallett said, “We are a clean sheet company with no legacy behind us. We want to be the best option, on the supply side, for teams sending us inventory.”

877,Fitz Tepper,"Nucleus, the home intercom system which started shipping in August, has closed $5.6M in Series A Funding.
The round was led by Amazon’s Alexa fund, which invests in promising startups that incorporate Alexa’s technology into their product (Nucleus recently added support for Alexa voice functionality). BoxGroup, Greylock Partners, FF Angel, Foxconn, and SV Angel also participated, as well as Joe Montana’s venture fund Liquid2.
Before Nucleus launched the company had a hypothesis that a smart home intercom would appeal to basically everyone – not just tech-savvy early adopters who wanted a cool gadget in their home.
So in addition to launching on Amazon the device has also been on display in 500 Lowes hardware stores, which has allowed Nucleus to be seen (and purchased) in person by people who wouldn’t traditionally be looking to buy an IOT connected device. The device was purchased by users in 47 states just in the first month of going on sale, which is a testament to their ability to gain market share outside of the East and West Coast tech hubs.
It helped that the company’s main type of customer isn’t someone who starts out looking for a smart device. Jonathan Frankel, co-founder and CEO of the company, explained that many Nucleus users are people who were originally searching for a home intercom system. But once they discover that a traditional voice-only system costs thousands of dollars (and has 10x less functionality than Nucleus) they are usually pretty psyched to buy Nucleus instead.
The other main type of user is someone trying to keep tabs on or stay in touch with a distant relative, and normally will buy a device or two for their own home and a device for the family member they are trying to keep tabs on.
Between these two groups the average user is buying 3-4 devices each. The price is also discounted from $249 to $199 as soon as you purchase two or more which also probably helps encourage people to spring for an extra (or two).
The company plans to use the new funding to ramp up product development. Nucleus has also announced plans today to acquire Ily, a home phone / intercom system that was crowdfunded earlier in June. The company explained that the acquisition will give them access to a new team of engineers already well versed in the home intercom space – something that should help the company quickly roll out new features to users.
Since the device updates automatically OTA and in the background, it’s easy for the development team to push out new product updates pretty frequently, something they already have started doing.",2016-09-21,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/incall_lee_nucleus_01.jpg?w=738,"nucleus,alexa,intercom",Nucleus raises $5.6M in Series A funding led by Amazon’s Alexa fund
878,Steve O'Hear,"“We’re not a bunch of startup dudes saying we’re disrupting insurance… we’re not a bunch of arrogant pricks,” FinanceFox co-founder and CEO Julian Teicke told me during a call late last week. The company, which is announcing $28 million in Series A funding today, is one of a number of European ‘insurtech’ startups who are attempting to bring insurance into the digital age.
But, unlike others, such as Clark and Knip, Teicke says FinanceFox is as much a platform for existing insurance brokers as it is an app to bypass them altogether. That’s because brokers can transition their customer base onto the app, as well as use it to spot holes in and sell additional coverage.
And by fully digitising their core processes, brokers are able to provide a much more efficient and up-to-date way of communicating with customers, helping to retain them along the way.
“We’re working together with industry experts who have experience,” says the FinanceFox CEO, adding that his father is a 30-year veteran of the insurance industry. The startup’s boss in Switzerland is Michael John, who is also the president of the national brokers association.
This, says Teicke, brings an immediate level of trust, not least amongst insurance brokers with whom FinanceFox partners and who might otherwise see insurance startups as a threat.
“I call the brokerage industry the broken brokerage industry,” he says, arguing that brokers who adopt platforms like FinanceFox will survive and those that don’t will be out-innovated by tech players. “They’re losing customers to digital players… they have high administrative costs, they have a lack of technology and efficiency in their processes, and they have no way of communicating with customers in a really innovative way. They are in a situation where they need to act”.
Price comparison sites, which remove the broker altogether, were the first to eat into the broken broker market, but a knock on effect is that a customer’s insurances are more fragmented than ever, making it a nightmare to track all of your coverage and deal with multiple insurance providers. In turn, this is seeing a new breed of mobile-first insurance apps offering to consolidate and help you manage your entire insurance cover.
To that end, FinanceFox lets you store of all of your insurance policies in a single app, through which you can also file and manage insurance claims. It does this by essentially making FinanceFox your legal representative, able to deal with existing (and future) insurance companies on your behalf.
During the on-boarding process, FinanceFox will contact each of your insurances in order to digitise your current policies, from which it can monitor coverage and suggest better, cheaper or more appropriate insurance. “FinanceFox eliminates all pain-points,” is how Teicke put it to me back in July. This, crucially, includes when it’s time to actually file a claim.
Notably, the service is free of charge for the customer, with the startup and its partner brokers making money via a “service component” paid by insurance companies in return for FinanceFox handling most of the admin and support side of insurance.
As I’ve previously noted, the business model has been around for almost as long as insurance brokerage has existed, but it’s also one that incentivises insurtech startups like FinanceFox to digitise as much of the insurance process as possible and drag insurance companies and brokers along with it. “We want to be an agent of change for the whole insurance industry,” says Teicke.
Meanwhile, I’m told that Target Global, and Horizons Ventures have led FinanceFox’s Series A. Existing investors Salesforce Ventures, Idinvest, Speedinvest, Seedcamp, AngelList, Victory Park Capital, and Samuel Skoblo also remain on board. FinanceFox is based in Zurich, Vienna, Berlin and Barcelona with over 80 employees, and plans to expand to Austria next.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/160811-financefox-update-policy-screen.jpg?w=738,financefox,European insurance tech startup FinanceFox closes $28M Series A
879,Matthew Lynley,"A big annoyance of city living is checking a site like Nextbus for your bus or rail’s arrival time, and then getting there only to find that you’ve missed it by a split second or the doors close as soon as you get there. Now, there’s actually an app that will yell at you to walk faster if you’re about to miss that bus.
With a big update today, Transit — an app that cleanly shows all the upcoming arrival times of public transportation in your area — is hoping to keep your daily commute on track with a new tool called Go. The app is getting a redesigned look in order to keep up with the ever-changing aesthetic desires of picky smartphone owners.
The app monitors your walking speed, telling you whether you’re going to get to your stop in time. It then will change your connections around if there are detours or delays in order to get to your destination on time. It’ll even wake you up before you get to your final stop, if you’re on a long commute and decide to use the train ride to catch a quick nap before work.
“When we first launched our app there wasn’t even a journey planner, this was back in 2012, because for us it was nailing that [commuter] experience,” Transit COO Jake Sion said. “I’m standing in a bus stop, leaning into traffic to see when my ride is coming, the only info I care about is when the bus arrives. With transit, there is so much info you provide the user and our goal is to make sure we don’t forget what it is most people want.”
The company said it has raised $2.4 million from Accel Partners, Accomplice, Real Ventures and BDC. Before raising this financing, Transit had only raised a small amount of seed funding for its operations based in Montreal. The app is available in around 125 cities in more than 9 countries.
The argument against using Google Maps, Sion says, is that you’re required to put in information for your entire route before you even have access to the next arrival times for buses. Google Maps is an experience largely centered around getting from point A to point B, while Transit is designed to be a quick lightweight commuter experience — you glance at your phone to see where it is, and then you move on.
For the more curious Bay Area transit nuts, some of Transit’s data is actually pulled from Nextbus — the typical go-to tool for figuring out when your next bus is arriving. Sion says that, in addition to Nextbus, Transit works to collect information from a number of municipal sources into getting the most accurate arrival time. Earlier this month, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority chose to endorse Transit as effectively the official app for keeping track of transportation in the Boston area.
But, in short, the data simply isn’t that reliable sometimes. And it can prove to be one of the most costly experiences of taking public transportation, such as being in a rush and being forced to call an Uber or Lyft to get to your destination on time. If Transit can help mitigate that risk, not only would it make for a generally better user experience, it could help make the municipal transit systems in cities overall more efficient and attractive to riders. And that means it could get additional revenue coming in and more opportunity to continue improving.
Going forward, there are a couple of things that Transit would like to do — number one, making sure it’s more accurate. If you’re in San Francisco you’ve probably experienced the frustration of arriving at a Muni stop only to find an asterisk next to an arrival time, basically telling you to stay put and, hey, maybe sometime in the near future it’ll get there (or call an Uber). Transit wants to do a better job of keeping track of user interactions in the app in order to more accurately predict bus and rail arrival times.
The problem already requires a lot of technical expertise, as the data coming in from all these different transit authorities is coming in through different channels and in different forms. That makes it a huge unstructured data problem, and cleaning all that up and compressing it is probably Transit’s first big challenge. A large part of the financing the company is raising is to ensure that it can continue to be the fastest and most accurate way to get that information by hiring additional engineers.
“It’s about bringing that entire urban transportation experience into one place,” Sion said. “What we realized is at the core of how people travel through cities it’s still public transit, it’s about how we improve that experience the most.”",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/export_screenv2.png?w=738,"transit-app,transit",Transit’s public transportation tracking app gets a big overhaul and $2.4M in funding
880,Matthew Lynley,"While there’s plenty of talent in the San Francisco Bay Area — where Pinterest’s main office is over at 5th and Brannan in San Francisco — it can be very costly to find and recruit that talent. And there’s a lot outside of San Francisco as well.
One city, in particular, that Pinterest has turned its eyes to is Seattle. Last month, it opened an engineering office in the city, and today it said it has hired its first head of engineering, Ruben Ortega, who was most recently the CTO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and an engineering executive at Nordstrom and Google prior to that.

Like looking for talent in cities like New York and other places, building and staffing up these offices serves two purposes: it helps keep talent that don’t necessarily want to move to the Bay Area to be in the mothership, and it also opens an opportunity to poach talent from other companies in an area.
In this case, Microsoft and Amazon can basically serve as an engineering graduate school for many potential candidates for companies based a few states south. Right now, it looks like that’s where things are headed for the office for the time being, with it largely being centered around engineering. But as the company continues to grow and more resources are poured into hiring, looking beyond the Bay Area is one of the first big steps it has to do in order to remain competitive.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-20-at-8-04-13-am.png?w=738,pinterest,Pinterest hires a head of engineering for its new Seattle office

TechCrunch understands that Angel.ai (formerly known as GoButler) has, at least partially, been acqui-hired by Amazon.
The e-commerce giant confirmed that Angel.ai co-founder and CEO Navid Hadzaad has joined the company. “I can confirm that Navid started at Amazon, and that his first day was yesterday. We don’t have anything further to share at this time,” an Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch.
A quick check on LinkedIn confirms Hadzaad’s new job title: “Head of New Bot Products at Amazon”. I also understand that several other Angel.ai employees are joining or have offers from Amazon and that the company is also acquiring some or all of Angel.ai’s technology and data.
That said, this doesn’t look like much of a return for investors, if any, with Angel.ai having raised $8 million in Series A funding in July 2015. The round was led by General Catalyst Partners, with participation from Lakestar, Rocket Internet’s Global Founders Capital, Slow Ventures, BoxGroup, Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary’s Sound Ventures, and Cherry Ventures.
Originally called GoButler, the startup launched as a virtual assistant that let you request anything on-demand, but had since gone through several pivots, settling on offering natural language processing technology to third-parties.
It’s this chat bot expertise that Amazon appears be acquiring as it too tries to figure out what role, if any, bots are going to play in “conversational commerce,” as Hadzaad once described it.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-20-at-17-43-07.png?w=738,angel-ai,"Angel.ai, a company that builds chat bots, acqui-hired by Amazon"
882,Sarah Perez,"Stitch Fix can’t figure out how to take my money, but they’re expanding to include men’s clothing now. Good luck with that! Oh, am I going to write a blog post on TechCrunch about my personal issues with a startup? Yeah, maybe? (You may now click into the comments below and commence your trolling.)
Here’s the thing: I haven’t been as obsessed with a new startup as I have been with Stitch Fix in many months. I wanted to love it. But the startup has failed me repeatedly, and I’ve had to quit after literally handing them my credit card and saying “please, take my money.”
The idea behind Stitch Fix, in case you’re unfamiliar, is fairly clever, if not original: after filling out an online profile with your fashion tastes and sizing information, the company will ship you a box of clothing and accessories you can try on at home. Those you like, you keep. The others you simply toss back into the provided bag and return via U.S. Postal mail – no trips to a nearby UPS or FedEx drop-off location.
Unlike its rival Trunk Club, acquired by Nordstrom, many of Stitch Fix’s items are more affordably priced. It’s also differentiated from other subscription clothing services like Le Tote or Gwynnie Bee, because it’s not a clothing rental service with the option to buy, it’s an automated shopping service with the option to return.
Since its launch in 2011, the company has shipped millions of boxes to customers, has opened 5 distribution centers across the U.S., and now employs a team of over 5,000, including 3,000 stylists and 75 data scientists. It has raised over $46 million in funding, according to CrunchBase.
It has also expanded into maternity, petites, accessories, and footwear, and plans to launch support for plus sizing next year. Men’s clothing, therefore, is just another box to check.
For men, the company is shipping brands like Mavi, AG, DL1961, 7 For All Mankind, 7 Diamonds, Grayers, Penguin, JACHS, and Scotch and Soda, as well as its own exclusive brand, Hawker Rye.
Unfortunately, with rapid growth and expansion, Stitch Fix could be losing its personal touch.
As least that was my experience, and my love affair with the service has since ended.
Online Profile Is Ignored
I chalked up my first issue with the startup to the hit-or-miss nature of automated shopping services, and the learning curve required.
In Stitch Fix’s online profile, you specify which body features you prefer to flaunt or downplay. In the arms section, I checked off “I’d prefer to keep them covered,” as I just like to wear shirts with sleeves.
What did my first box from Stitch Fix contain? No less than three sleeveless shirts. Three!
I mean, what? Did anyone actually read the profile?
Even an algorithm should have been able to handle this task. I figured it would take time for Stitch Fix to learn my style, but I expected it to at least handle the basics.
I fired off an email to customer service, received an apology, a waiving of my styling fee, and I started over.
Subsequent boxes were more on target. Soon, I found myself wanting to keep several things they contained. The items weren’t terribly pricey, and while I could probably find similar things for less, the real benefit was the convenience of not having to actually shop.
I began to look forward to getting my Fix, as they call their shipments. I would launch the app, track their arrival, then hurry home to unbox them.
Connect Your Social Profiles? Why Bother? 
But other issues remained. The app bugged me to connect my social profiles so Stitch Fix’s stylists could see what sort of clothing I liked by tracking what I pinned on Pinterest, for example.
I finally got around to connecting a Pinterest board which contained only a couple of things – more of a test to see if the pins had any influence on the clothing selections.

I pinned a pair of cute, red, open-toe wedges (don’t judge me) – a sold out shoe from a particular brand that I hoped would inspire Stitch Fix to seek out a comparable item. After all, “red wedge” isn’t exactly hard-to-find footwear.
Apparently, Stitch Fix doesn’t get this personalized, however.
Not only did I never receive a wedge of any sort, the only shoe ever sent was in an entirely different genre, didn’t fit (it was clearly a narrow, where I have specified wide), and wasn’t even red.
Bummer. Well, so much for pinning.
Still, the boxes had more hits than misses, and I continued to shop.
Literally Won’t Take My Money 
But then I lost my Visa card, and had to have my bank replace it.
Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever lost your credit card, but let me tell you – you’ll have to update your payment information on about 1,439 websites before all is said and done. (A slight exaggeration, perhaps, but it’s definitely a lot).
In any event, outside of Amazon, you’ll rely on your subscription services to send you an email notification that your payment information is out of date, or your card was declined – otherwise, you just won’t remember which ones to update.
Stitch Fix forgot this critical step.

At some point, it popped into my head that it had been awhile since my last box and I launched the app to check on its status. My Fix was no longer scheduled.
As it had been some time since the payment card replacement process at this point, I didn’t immediately remember this was the likely cause.
A customer support email session later, I discovered that Stitch Fix tried to charge my old card, my card was declined, so they simply cancelled my Fix. No notification was sent about this. (I suggested this is the sort of thing that might warrant a ping in the future).
I updated the payment card information, and rescheduled the Fix to a new date.
Again, it never arrived.
I relaunched the app, and there was only the option to reschedule the Fix. Once more, I hit up customer service and asked what happened – after all, my payment information was now current.
They claimed they were charging the new card, and I explained that’s obviously not the case because the charge would go through – there’s plenty of money in the account for their $20 styling fee. Clearly, you’re still charging the old card and getting declined, I said.
After a frustrating session where I confirmed the card number and billing address, and was sent some copy-and-pasted tips on “how to update your account billing information,” I gave up. I told the company I was going to take a break from receiving their Fixes since they can’t figure out how to take my money.
“I would love to do all that I can to ensure that you receive a Fix,” wrote the rep. “The reasons vary as to why the bank doesn’t accept the transaction, but one suggestion is to contact your bank for more details.”
Note that because of the possibility of user error on the initial entry, I used Dashlane’s form-filler to auto-enter the payment card information again ahead of the second cancellation. Even in the event that somehow the card information was still entered incorrectly through the automated tool, what was most frustrating about this experience is that StitchFix sent no alerts or emails when the Fix was cancelled due to declines. (See below as proof – all communications from the company were support tickets, not ‘payment declined’ or ‘fix cancelled’).

At the end of the day, this is the real problem with the payment issue.
 
But hey, Stitch Fix is launching a men’s line. Like I said, good luck with that.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/stitch-fix-mens.jpg?w=738,"clothing,subscription-services","Subscription clothing service Stitch Fix expands to Men’s, still can’t figure out how to take my money"
883,John Mannes,"Progressly, a new platform for supporting growth within large enterprises, just got a big boost in both money and staffing. Ruslan Belkin, a former top exec from Twitter and LinkedIn will be joining the roughly two year old company. With the spotlight drawn, Progressly is taking the opportunity to formally announce a $6 million Series A, led by 8VC, as part of its official coming out party.
Progressly is developing a platform to facilitate the creation of transparent action plans so employees across large business can stay on top of new projects. The tool also provides convenient analytics to evaluate progress every step of the way and has a long term vision to enable businesses to not only share best practices internally, but share them externally with other businesses.

One way to think of Progressly’s open source vision is as Netflix for enterprise. Rather than a group plan allowing everyone in a massive company to indulge in binge watching Stranger Things, Progressly lets everyone in a company binge watch best practices.
While this may sound totally lame in comparison, if you take a moment to stop eating Eggo waffles, it’s actually an innovative premise. Here’s why — companies have been spending millions of dollars on creating open source libraries for developers to stay competitive in attracting and retaining top employees. Unfortunately, up until this point, there hasn’t really been a way to open source the business side of businesses. However, with new applications of the open source philosophy, concerns can emerge about its impact on competitiveness.
“It’s refreshing to hear how everyone wanted to talk about best practices,” said Nicholas Candito, co-founder of Progressly. “Ultimately it makes it easier for people to be indispensable to their organizations.”
On the ground, Progressly augments traditional platforms like Microsoft Sharepoint. The platform elevates the nitty gritty of business decisions into the limelight.
“Every company has a specific way they would approach a credit audit, but the great thing that communities do is make it easier to find the right answer,” noted Candito. “Progressly can be a megaphone for things that have done really well.”
The company is targeting enterprises in the financial services, energy and telecommunications sectors. These organizations tend to have a number of critical, non-technical workflows that are implemented with a top down structure. Progressly not only lets businesses organize their efforts, but creates a world where a company can look back and check the status of individual functional groups and evaluate how well new initiatives are progressing.
“Some of our investors were behind companies like Yammer,” added Candito. “It’s been a strong signal that companies are really hungry for things that drive collaboration, packaged it in a strategic way.”
Aside from supporting organizational leadership, the platform is brining some support to individuals on the front lines, responsible for sending emails and holding meetings. Just as Slack and Yammer bulldozed home grown and offline systems for communication and collaboration, Progressly hopes to do the same for business processes.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-12-at-5-33-28-pm.png?w=738,"computing,software",Business process platform Progressly nabs Ruslan Belkin and announces $6M Series A from 8VC
884,Jordan Crook,"Tinder is teaming up with Spotify to give users a new way to judge each other.
Just as Tinder allowed folks to connect their Instagram accounts to their Tinder profile, the same is now true for Spotify. Users will be able to check out each others’ most-played songs on Spotify.
But even if you don’t have Spotify, Tinder will still let you use Spotify to add your ‘Tinder Anthem’ to your profile. Think back to the MySpace days of auto-playing songs on profiles and you’ll have a pretty good idea of what this will feel like.
“Music is an important part of making new connections and getting to know existing ones,” said Tinder CEO Sean Rad. “Just like you go to the bar that plays your favorite music, you’re likely attracted to the people at that bar who enjoy the same music. We want to do the same thing with the Spotify integration.”
Alongside most-played music and Tinder Anthems, Tinder is also launching the TinderMusic account on Spotify. TinderMusic is a set of themes (“Pre-Swipe”, “Discovery”, “Match”, “Love at First Swipe”, and “Date Night”) that will help users find and tailor the right playlist in the moment.
It’s worth noting that Tinder isn’t the first dating app to integrate music tastes through Spotify. Bumble, a competing app that puts the ball in the girl’s court, launched an integration with Spotify back in June, letting users put their top artists inside their profile.
That said, Tinder is the first to let users actually play music within the app as a way to express themselves.",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/tinder_spotify_phone_final.png?w=738,,Tinder taps Spotify to let you add music to your profile
885,Lora Kolodny,"Gunning to become the top seller of used cars online, Vroom Inc. has raised $50 million in a Series E round of equity funding, bringing its total capital raised to $218 million.
The market for used cars in the U.S. alone surpasses $400 billion annually. According to the Edmunds.com Used Vehicle Market Report, retailers sold 38.3 million used cars in 2015 at an average price of $18,500.
When the company started up in 2013, it was originally billed as a stress-free way to buy or sell pre-owned vehicles online and via mobile.
Vroom’s current CEO Paul Hennessy, who joined the company in June this year and was previously the CEO of Priceline.com, drew parallels between online travel agencies and Vroom.
Both markets are highly fragmented and filled with competition online and off. E-commerce platforms like Vroom could put some brick and mortar dealerships out of business, he acknowledged.
“At the highest level, we assemble great inventory for customers, give them a great shopping experience via mobile or desktop…and simplify the buying process so they can pull the trigger without haggling and paperwork. The car is delivered to your front door,” Hennessy said.
Buyers get seven days to test drive a vehicle after it’s delivered. Hennessy said he wants car shopping to be as easy as buying (or returning) a pair of shoes online.
On the seller-side, users can upload photos of their vehicle along with a VIN number via smartphone app to attain a quote from Vroom, and soon get their cars picked up.
Vroom uses proprietary algorithms and data about the value of different cars and trucks in different conditions to set prices. Vroom also runs a huge repairs and refurbishing operation, Texas Direct Auto, which it acquired last year.
Vroom’s revenue today comes from sales of pre-owned vehicles to both individual consumers and rental car companies. It also sells scrap, i.e. after market parts from vehicles that can’t be fully repaired. And it generates revenue from selling warranties and arranging auto loans.
 
Self-driving vehicle tech is beginning to trickle into the market– including from startups like Comma.ai or Nauto, who want to retrofit computer-brains to cars that weren’t built to be autonomous.
As such, Vroom investors and executives expect to see a shift in consumer demand. “We are always looking into ways to put consumers in the best car they can get for the price they want to pay,” Hennessy said.
Vroom’s competition abounds, ranging from large public companies like Carmax, TrueCar and Ebay Motors, to classifieds sties like Craigslist or Carfax, and other venture-backed startups including Beepi, Shift and Carlypso.
Vroom has partnerships with some of its ostensible competitors, namely Ebay.
T. Rowe Price led Vroom’s latest round of funding joined by new investors Altimeter Capital and Foxhaven Asset Management, and earlier backers L. Catterton, General Catalyst Partners and Allen & Co.
Altimeter Capital founder Brad Gerstner said he expects the company to use the funding to become a household name, and to expand its operations in a way that will ensure efficient delivery of vehicles to customers all around the country.
Gerstner said:
“The magic of Amazon is not just that I can shop online but that something arrives at my house very quickly and predictably, and they don’t make mistakes. There’s no single silver bullet. It’s about making every step in a purchase process– from the content through the entire supply chain– better for consumers than anything else that’s out there.”
Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that Allon Bloch was Vroom’s founder. He was its CEO before Paul Hennessy.  ",2016-09-20,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/i6a0523-copy-1.jpg?w=738,"shift,beepi,vroom,selling-used-cars",Vroom raises $50 million to make buying a used car as easy as shoe shopping online

Here is a run-down of the teams, with some more details of those that stood out. You can watch a Facebook Live recording of the demos here.
Didimo
They say: “Didimo creates Virtual Avatars ready to be animated with one photo.”
• It’s already secured partnerships with key players in gaming and digital media. This is about creating personalized 3D avatars at scale. This could change the gaming world by putting the real you inside the game.
Madbarz
They say: “Next gen fitness app right in the middle of the modern fitness revolution”
• This is an app which turns your phone into a personal trainer that focuses on muscles rather than cardio. This has already reached 500k users and is booking £200,000 a month in revenue, and that’s before they’ve turned on £10 a month subscriptions.
AID:Tech
They say: “AID:Tech brings transparency and efficiency to the distribution of resources by governments, NGO’s and charities.”
• Using the blockchain they aim to “guarantee that international aid reaches the right person at the right time.” It’s so far rolled out projects in Haiti, France, Serbia, Malawi and Pakistan in 2016.
SwiftComply
They say: “Simplifying environmental compliance for more sustainable communities.”
• Swiftcomply a real-time platform for restaurant compliance, tackling the unsexy topic of “Fat Oil & Grease compliance” for restaurants and turning it into a platform. Restaurants book a “grease trap service” and then the platforms automatically notifies the local inspector with a digital record and updates the restaurant’s compliance status.
Mindi
They say: “Mindi combines the best of human and artificial intelligence to create optimal solutions.”
• This is about optimising datacenters with AI. It’s already reduced energy consumption by 20% at Digital Ocean without replacing hardware.
Asset Vault
They say: “Catalogue, protect and manage your physical and digital assets”.
• AssetVault puts you in control of your assets and protects them in your own terms.
Avalon AI

887,Steve O'Hear,"French food delivery startup FoodChéri, which operates an online only restaurant along the lines of EatFirst in the UK or Munchery’s original model in the US, has raised €6 million in Series A funding led by 360 Capital Partners, and Breega Capital.

Also noteworthy is that Samaipata Ventures is already an investor in Jinn, the Europe same-hour delivery startup, which counts food delivery as one of its most popular categories.
Currently serving 1,000 meals per day to “busy professionals” in Paris and various suburbs, including Neuilly-sur-Seine, Levallois, Boulogne-Billancourt, and Issy-les-Moulineaux, FoodChéri lets you order fresh chef-prepared meals that are chilled and ready to reheat and consume upon delivery.
It’s a model that avoids some of the pitfalls faced by restaurant delivery services, such as UberEATs and Deliveroo, in that orders can be pooled for delivery as food doesn’t need to be delivered hot. FoodChéri also enables orders to be placed “on-demand” or days in advance.
“[We help] city dwellers eat fresher, healthier home-style meals with the convenience of fast food delivered to your doorstep,” explains FoodChéri co-founder and CEO Patrick Asdaghi, who was previously CMO of La Fourchette.
“We solve it with a ‘full-stack’ food operation, from creating the recipe and preparing the ingredients to last-mile delivery, and everything in between”.
Asdaghi tells me the initial focus for FoodChéri was serving dinner for busy professionals, but in April 2016 added lunches. The startup also targets smaller companies that don’t have their own cafeterias or are looking to provide an alternative and healthier lunch option for staff.

“Many of our customers work full-time and don’t always have the time or energy to make their own meals, or want a change from the local cafeteria or snack shop, but still want to eat well without exploding their budget. In France our main competitor is Frichti even though they have a slightly different positioning in terms of the food offering”, he adds.
Meanwhile, FoodChéri says the funds will primarily be used to extend delivery areas within the Greater Paris region before potential international expansion. In addition, the startup plans to spend on recruitment to add a further dozen or so staff to its current 40 person headcount, and for further product development.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/team-couleur.jpg?w=738,,French online restaurant FoodChéri raises €6M Series A
888,Josh Constine,"The iPhone 7’s powerful new camera features will be getting the spotlight in an upcoming version of Instagram. Ian Spalter, Instagram’s head of design, appeared on-stage at the iPhone 7 launch event to demo the iPhone-inspired upgrades coming to his app.
The iPhone 7 Plus telephoto zoom lens will be usable by dragging a single finger up and down in Instagram — an interface popularized by Snapchat. Haptic feedback will help you know just how zoomed you are, and could help you stay in the 2X optical zoom offered by the iPhone 7 Plus without straying into digital zoom that degrades quality. Instagram added one-finger zoom to Stories last month so you can do comedic zoom effects while shooting video or quickly line up a shot.
All of Instagram’s color filters are being redesigned to take advantage of the iPhone 7 camera sensor’s wide-gamut color detection. This will make Instagrams even more vivid by divining a broader range hues from your shots.
3D Touch will let you jump right into adding a photo to your Instagram Story. Since Stories are supposed to be raw and off-the-cuff, getting to their camera quicker should let people shoot better candids and avoid missing those spontaneous moments.
And thanks to the Live Photos API, iPhone Live Photos will be able to instantly be converted into Instagram Boomerang back-and-forth GIFs. Previously, you had to shoot Boomerangs in its dedicated app that takes a bunch of stills and combines them into an animation. The new version will let you just shoot in the default iPhone camera and then morph them into Boomerangs.
The partnership between Apple and the Facebook-owned Instagram could drive a potential strategy where Apple builds the underlying technology while leaving the creative flourishes to Instagram. Apple didn’t announce its own animated GIF Boomerang competitor. Instead it’s doing what it does best — the hardware — and letting Instagram handle how to turn that raw power into art.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/instagram-iphone-7.jpg?w=738,iphone-7,"Instagram is building new zoom, filter, and GIF features for the iPhone 7 camera"
889,Haje Jan Kamps,"With the newest iPhone 7, Apple is saying buh-bye to a technology that’s been going strong for almost 140 years. It has served us well, but the Cupertino-based maven today announced it decided that enough is enough. The future, it seems, is Bluetooth and Lightning cables.
Apple doesn’t have the, ahem, courage to fully commit this retro-tech murder, however. Hedging its bets, the company includes a dongle in every iPhone 7 box so you can still use, as Phil Schiller puts it, “some analog old connected devices”.
The 3.5mm jack (or “mini jack”, “headphone jack” or “TRS jack”) is a descendant from the quarter-inch jack. It was originally invented to make it easy for telephone operators to make connections on their switchboards back in the 1870s some time. The design is simple and has proven to withstand the test of time. I mean, when was the last time you used tech from 140 years ago?
The little dimple at the front tip of the connector ensures that the plug can be held securely in place by the socket, but also easily removed many times over. The quarter-inch jack in still in use, too, actually — if you’re a guitarist or bass player, you’ll have seen the sockets on your guitar and amp.
The invention was ingenious, and was often referred to as the TRS plug – for Tip, Ring, Sleeve. It is a perfectly round plug can only be plugged in one way (try that with an USB plug!) which meant that operators could plug and unplug the telephone connections without really looking. 
In the 1960s, a smaller, 3.5mm version of the same design was introduced. It was less robust, but suited the brave new world of (semi)portable electronics better. Later on, for applications that needed stereo audio and a microphone, too, manufacturers simply added another ring to the setup, calling it the TRRS (tip, ring, ring, sleeve) and it served faithfully for another number of years.
If 2,500 of our readers are anything to go by, it looks like just over half (55 percent) of those who would consider buying the iPhone would do so even if there isn’t a headphone port, whereas 45 percent responded with a “no, thanks, Apple”.
 
The world hasn’t stood still, and new technologies have come along. Bluetooth headphones are readily available and many other accessories work over Bluetooth and Apple’s proprietary Lightning cable. Apple has a long history of killing off tech it felt was on its way out and we have to give them credit for avoiding port bloat. To wit, its newest Macbook line contains exactly two ports: USB-C and… a headphone jack.
Some — including yours sincerely — feel that the world may be poorer without headphone jacks. That isn’t just because I recently purchased a set of very nice, premium, wired headphones. Many startups and tinkerers rely on the relative accessibility of the 3.5mm jack to hack and develop for smartphones.
The future marches on, relentlessly. Dear mini jack, you had a good run. We’ll miss you.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/20160907-_dsc2336.jpg?w=738,"headphone-jack,iphone-event-2016,iphone-event",Apple kills headphone jack (1878 – 2016). RIP.
890,Haje Jan Kamps,"Apple today announced that the newest generation iPhone will do away with the ubiquitous headphone jack, apparently to make the phone waterproof and to make space for the haptic feedback engine for the home button. Obviously sad news if you just bought an expensive new pair of headphones, but the interface is used for a lot more than just pumping phat beats down your ear tunnels.
From filmmakers to concerned parents, there’s a rich ecosystem of “appcessories” that use the headphone port for two-way communication.
Removing the headphone jack from a phone is problematic; the most obvious reasons have been discussed to death — most succinctly summarized by Owen Williams over on Medium. TL;DR: Bluetooth is a pain, 3.5mm jacks just work.
The humble headphone jack socket has a tremendous advantage over Micro USB, USB-C, Apple’s 15-pin and Lightning adapter and the host of other connectors that have been used on cell phones over the years. It is there, no matter if you’re using Windows Phone, Android, BlackBerry or iOS.
It also sports a surprisingly robust three-channel communication interface: One channel in (for the microphone) and two channels out (for the left and right stereo channel). What not a lot of people realize is that the headphone socket also supplies a tiny amount of power. Not a lot, but the microphone that’s embedded into your innocuous-looking earbuds does need a little bit of power, which can be harvested (pdf) to power, say, a microprocessor in an accessory.
Now take a world of hackers, tinkerers and creative technicians and give them a three-channel interface plus low voltage. What do you get? A rich ecosystem of fantastic little accessories.

Hell, it isn’t even just the small companies that have embraced the simplicity of having a single socket available on all smartphones out there. Square, the company that made it possible for thousands of small businesses to make charges by credit card, is still sending out free magstripe readers to get its customers onboarded onto its service quickly.
 
Apple is frequently highlighting how good its cameras are, most recently with yet another huge Shot on iPhone billboard campaign. It is no surprise, then, that filmmakers are embracing the platform for creating movies.
For filmmakers, it turns out that the camera on modern iPhones is plenty good for shooting  — at least one Hollywood film has been shot exclusively on iPhones. The cameras on the devices are undeniably great, but audio is another matter. For film, you can always use an external sound recorder. The increasingly popular live streaming is quite a different barrel of fish: you need an external microphone.
Products like MicW’s $200 iShotgun, RØDE’s $80 SmartLav and TASCAM’s $35 TM-ST1 all rely on the 3.5mm socket on your device, which means they can be used on all phones and most cameras. Of course, microphone companies have also created Lighting accessories for audio recording, but if a filmmaker is going to splurge $500 on a Sennheiser microphone, they’ll probably want a 3.5mm jack so it can be used with other cameras than just the iPhone.
Plugging fancier microphones into a microphone socket doesn’t seem very revolutionary? Okay, let’s take a look at some of the more exotic uses of the headphone socket.
The iPhone has a lot of sensors built in, but temperature isn’t one of them, so there are a few companies that have created external thermometers. Thermodo’s solution is a perfect example. It started its life with a $330,000 Kickstarter campaign, creating a spectacularly elegant little device for measuring how close you’re going to get to freezing to death on your camping trip.
“I understand why Apple is doing this,” says Thermodo’s CEO and founder, Willi Wu, commenting about how a lack of headphone sockets is going to be problematic. “It’s too bad the consumer gets stuck in the middle. They won’t be able to use their existing headphones and accessories like Thermodo. Apple has now removed the only open standard port available, forcing companies to use their proprietary and royalty based Lightning connector. It would be impossible to make Thermodo as small as it is using the Lightning connector.”
More advanced measuring devices are available, too, including HMB’s eSmogMeter that measures electric fields. There are even fully functional oscilloscope and multimeter appcessories that plug into the headphone socket.
With Bevel, you can use your phone to make 3D scans of the real world. iBlazr brightens your smartphone photos. WeatherPoint claims to be the world’s smallest weather station. FloJack adds NFC reading to your iPhone. Lumu helps your phone pose as a light meter. Pluggy Lock uses the headphone socket to tether your phone semi-securely in place. MyLED adds a Blink(1)-like LED to your phone to enable new types of notifications. The FDA-approved Kinsa’s smart thermometer measures your body temperature. Yuan Yang, a researcher at the University of Berkeley demoed a device that can help practitioners of Chinese Medicine diagnose their patients (pdf).
There’s a tremendously broad array of app-empowered accessories out there that have one thing in common: connecting apps to the outside world via a headphone socket.
I understand how, from Apple’s point of view, locking down its ecosystem even harder than it has been before, the company can make more money. It might even make the argument that building a higher walled garden equals higher security and reliability for its customers. In the process, the company has left behind the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels and the troublemakers.
The point is that by removing the headphone socket and effectively blocking things like Project HiJack, which with easy-to-buy $80 off-the-shelf development kits makes hardware and app hacking easy and accessible, Apple reaffirms that it is fond of rules. Especially its own. It continues to make it harder for indie companies to hack their way to a more interesting future, without having to go through Apple’s borderline draconian MFi approval process. Just curious and want to learn? You’re explicitly out of luck — in its MFi FAQ, Apple tells students and hobbyists that they’re not welcome.

There has been quite some buzz around Facebook’s Messenger platform lately. And that’s not all. Almost daily, you can read new articles about chatbots, conversational interfaces, digital assistants, AI and messaging platforms. Is chat the next generation of how we connect and interact with the internet? Can Facebook’s Messenger eventually become the platform that connects all services that consumers need? 
Since the launch of the Messenger platform with chatbots in April, Facebook has allowed businesses to deliver automated interactive experiences, e-commerce guidance and customer support with the help of chatbots. Thanks to the new Send/Receive API, these chatbots can send not only text but also structured messages, including images, hyperlinks and CTA buttons, within their customer interactions. 
Users can browse product carousels to discover options and get directed to the web to finish their purchase. Recently, Facebook additionally announced that chatbots can now send promotions and subscription-based messages that make retargeting, up-selling and cross-selling possible. 
Businesses have shown great interest and want to harness the capabilities of Messenger in order to enhance their customer relations, build up their brands and gain more profits.
But despite all the news and trending discussions right now, have chatbots delivered what was promised? Will they really have the potential to substitute native apps in the long run?
The current interest in chatbots is obvious. They can be an entirely new way to engage your customers by providing personalized, interactive communication similar to talking to a human while being able to scale for the masses. They have the potential to increase user engagement and satisfaction for a brand. Eventually, they can perform more complex tasks than requesting a taxi or booking flights. 
There is much talk of disruption because they could change the entire advertising industry through integrated marketing. And the best part is they provide access to digital services without the need of installing an app. But where are they now?
More than 18,000 bots have been built for Facebook Messenger. While some engage and delight consumers, most of them have not yet proven their value to the masses. In fact, beyond the tech scene, most people don’t even know what a chatbot is and what it is good for. This shows that a core underlying principle should not be forgotten when creating the next semi-intelligent chatbot: No one actually wants to talk to a bot. 
Users want solutions to their problems. They want answers to their questions. They want their needs to be fulfilled the most efficient and natural way. What they don’t want is to type in a message on their small smartphone keyboards just to see the bot doesn’t understand it again and again.

For chatbots to work, developers must stop thinking about them as a bot. It is a new channel that can be used to engage with an audience via automated processes. No one expects an automated email campaign to solve all problems, but it is good in its own ways: distributing content and educating users. 
This is also how chatbots should be used: not as a one-size-fits-all solution to all business services. It is only valuable when it can be the most efficient channel for customers to actually engage via a question and answer kind of way. It can be great if customers want to know something specific and a conversational interaction method is better than searching, browsing or button-clicking.
 But chatbots currently just don’t feel right when I want to browse through all available options or when I know exactly what to do and a button is 5x faster than the text input. Not every service should be offered as a native app, and the same is true for chatbots.
In time though, once the technology is more mature and machine learning has been adopted by the masses, I can see the potential that a conversational interaction method may indeed be best to solve problems. It will eventually be possible to talk to your phone like talking to a friend, and the virtual digital assistant will automatically combine different chatbots to compile your optimal solution. This leads to the next step in human-computer interaction: the human-feeling user interface.
Chatbots are the interim solution before a more intelligent solution appears: In the future, a more or less General AI will be able to handle most of our questions, problems or inquiries. On the contrary, a chatbot (even an intelligent one) can be considered as narrow AI, with a limited array of possible questions it can handle. 
Chatbots will soon be able to integrate information from our social media profiles, browsing and shopping history, geolocation, available smartphone sensors and even our behavioral biometrics. But still, they will be made to solve a specific problem; and once an inquiry goes beyond the spectrum of situations for which it was trained, the interaction will feel weird. The end goal will always be to create a human-computer interaction method that feels human.
“Human” doesn’t mean to have unnecessary questions asked or to have imperfection incorporated in the AI; it means that we can get solutions to our problems without knowing the specific syntax. Natural language processing (NLP) will enable us to talk with the system that is designed for voice; and through other fields of AI, like reasoning and knowledge representation, the response of the system will feel intelligent and human.

Once machines get smarter, traditional user interfaces can be simplified, abstracted or even hidden. The perfect user interface is no visible user interface, because then users can just interact with the system without needing to know the operating rules and patterns. And it should not only be the interface. The entire user experience should feel human. Interacting with humans is different because humans have contextual awareness. Humans empathize. Humans can think about you and your problems before you explicitly express them. Maybe one day, a general AI will be able to “feel” and “think ahead” to solve your problems before they arise. 
Are we in any way close to having a general assistant that can do what we ask? All the big tech companies have created some sort of digital assistant. Facebook announced M, its own digital assistant similar to Siri, Cortana or Google Now a year ago. Contrary to other assistants, it is powered by both AI and people in order to make its interactions more human. Mark Zuckerberg said that through NLP and AI, in combination with human help, users will talk to Messenger bots just like talking to their friends. 
M is part of a bigger game to make people more used to getting things done via Messenger (shopping, booking, scheduling, ordering etc.). Also, M is interesting for Facebook to learn more about consumers’ needs (what type of services they would like to have in Messenger). But we haven’t heard that much from M. Facebook’s Messenger chief David Marcus confirmed that M won’t be broadly ready for years. But still, hope remains that one day it can be the missing link that combines all separate chatbots into one intelligent service system. 
Facebook’s Messenger is well positioned to become the holistic platform that hosts all different kinds of services in the future. As mentioned, though, they are not the only ones. Isn’t there already another messaging platform that is a couple of steps ahead?
If you look beyond the western tech scene, there is clearly a messaging platform that has already figured out how to transform itself from a chat app into a more powerful platform, portal and operating system: WeChat.
 WeChat in China is what all messaging platforms aspire to be: It accompanies the users throughout their daily life in every possible aspect — making it indispensable in people’s minds. Through WeChat, Chinese can do everything from chatting with friends, groups or strangers to conducting business or e-commerce, accessing fintech applications, playing games, or even connecting to diverse IoT devices. 
WeChat does it in a way similar to Messenger — by integrating third-party applications in its ecosystem. And with an extremely high average revenue per user of more US$7 per year, it has found ways to monetize its massive user base that other messaging platforms can only dream of. WeChat has already accomplished what Messenger is just beginning to build up. 

When asking people about their experience with WeChat, you’ll only hear enthusiasm. By offering new possibilities to meet and interact with people, WeChat has fulfilled the needs of a society where loneliness is a common status (a whole generation grew up with everyone being an only child). WeChat has succeeded extremely well in tailoring the app experience toward the target group while offering services on top that make it essential to everyone. 
More than that, WeChat has continuously been able to surprise and delight its users with new innovative features way ahead of other messaging platforms. For example, voice messages took over in WeChat years ahead WhatsApp or Messenger. Another example of how WeChat captures its users’ engagement is a stunt at Chinese New Year where users were able to send each other random amounts of lucky money — an important part of Chinese culture. Facebook’s Messenger is a strong general communication platform, but, so far, it fails to surprise and delight its individual user segments.
A strong differentiator is that WeChat actually is not only a messaging platform. It has elements of a social network where people can update their status or follow official accounts of celebrities or brands. Brands in China often use WeChat as their main channel for PR, content marketing, customer acquisition and brand marketing. Facebook clearly aims for this goal, as well, but it doesn’t enjoy the dominance in possible touch points with users as WeChat does. 
The ultimate game changer is WeChat’s integration of payments. They make it not only easy, but fun, to send money to friends. It also is convenient to pay merchants offline and online, and people are additionally incentivized with discounts to use WeChat Pay. This makes it possible for Chinese people in metropolitan areas to completely forgo cash. WeChat Pay is what fosters its e-commerce functionalities and attracts millions of online stores to the platform.
 Facebook Messenger has the function of P2P payments, but payments are not integrated into the bot functionality (so far). And unlike within WeChat, it is quite difficult for small businesses to set up an e-commerce bot in Messenger, even with options like wit.ai (acquired by Facebook). 
All of these are just a few examples of what makes WeChat great. The point is, why is Messenger so far behind? Why does even its UI/UX have inferiorities to WeChat? Why doesn’t Messenger succeed in astonishing people around the world with innovative features? (Note: In Europe, we often don’t even see many cool features like P2P payments for years.)
 Copying WeChat is obviously not the right way to go because WeChat succeeded by tailoring its app experience to the needs of the Chinese market. But there are definitely inspirations from the East that should have major impacts on the roadmap of Messenger. And inspirations from other messaging apps don’t stop there.

There are many more messaging apps trying to build up a platform play. Slack was among the first that not only revolutionized messaging in businesses but also engaged a massive developer ecosystem that is creating useful third-party applications within Slack. It is super fun to go and discover new bots on Slack’s bot store (App Directory), which can add value to team communication. Why doesn’t Facebook have an intuitive and searchable bot store? And why does Facebook still completely ignore the space of communication in professional/business contexts? 
It is still extremely difficult to communicate with people on Facebook before adding them as friends. Friendship seems like a quite personal concept if I only want to speak with someone a couple of times or simply stay in touch without sharing private statuses. It looks like Facebook even wants people to go to Twitter or LinkedIn to connect with professional contacts instead.

Another competitor that Facebook can learn from is Snapchat. Contrary to Messenger, Snapchat is what younger people consider cool and more engaging through completely new possibilities to interact with peers or even brands. Snapchat realized that needs are changing and people want to share moments in their life without leaving a trace in the World Wide Web. Also, people were enabled to express their creativity through the application of fun photo and video filters. Because some filters change on a weekly basis, users are incentivized to revisit the app again and again to share even more fun and embarrassing pictures with their friends.
 Since people started sharing less and less content on Facebook, the platform has never really figured out a new way to invert that negative trend. Shouldn’t Messenger, as a personal communication platform, be able to motivate people to share pictures and videos again? 
It is clear that Messenger still needs to work hard to accomplish its goals and exceed its high expectations. Messenger has a strong position with its vast user base across the world. But it needs to keep innovating in order to continuously engage and delight this user base in new ways. For that, it needs to stay user-centric and always be on the user’s side instead of focusing on how to make more money with businesses. Here are some options how Messenger can improve itself through inspirations from competitors, while staying true to itself and shaping its own path.
In my opinion, Messenger needs to evolve much further and in more fields to become dominant in the future. On a strategic level, it could invest in these three pillars to reinvent itself:

These strategic aspects reflect what other competitors have been doing well. WeChat operates in personal and business contexts. Snapchat engages users by new offerings again and again. Slack makes it easy to find and integrate new apps/bots into its platform. Kik lets friends share bots in group chats or in private messages, which creates some virality. 
If Messenger succeeds in catching up in these fields it can really become the underlying platform that connects the new wave of applications — pushing away Apple and Google from its iOS and Android thrones. So what can Messenger improve in the near future to come a step closer to that vision? 
Small incremental Improvements: These are improvements that make the messaging experience itself less inferior to other messaging apps. Messenger can start by allowing multiple-people video calls, enable voice messages to go beyond 1 minute and work on small UI/UX elements that make the app better. It can make interacting with bots faster by getting rid of the “Get Started” Button at the beginning of the conversation. And it can make group interactions with bots possible. Bots have two discovery issues: The users need to first find the bot and then need to figure out what the bot can be asked. Having an intuitive and searchable bot store within Messenger would be the first step to making people discover and find out more about the bot.

Bigger substantial improvements: These are improvements that require more investment and may make the brand go out of its comfort zone a little. Messenger could include some sort of daily or weekly change in features that continuously surprises the users in a positive way. First attempts were already made, e.g. with birthday balloons, but we need more of these! And we need features that are not only nice to look at but that let us interact and engage with others. The same way that people love to discover and play with new Google Doodles or Snapchat filters, Messenger could build up something similar that is engaging in new ways. Facebook is already on the right track. Through the recent launch of Lifestage, the company shows its wish to engage younger audiences with new ways to express oneself. In the near future, Facebook could integrate FB Live within Messenger or go a step further with live VR content within Messenger to allow new interaction methods for users. 
Bold and totally new functionalities: These are new developments that have probably not been often thought of in the context of Messenger. Facebook can work out a new B2B product that integrates Messenger and its bots directly on websites for better customer support through live chat. It can even go beyond its own bot ecosystem and build up a development framework that allows easy cross-platform development of bots, similar to React Native for native apps. This way, developers would be incentivized to build new bots for Messenger that can also be launched on other messaging platforms. And maybe Facebook can even figure out a new way to integrate Instant Apps for Android or similar functionalities within Messenger that make possible executing small app functions within a minimized web view. 
All of these aspects show there is still plenty to do for Facebook’s ecosystem. The current disillusionment of dumb chatbots is only temporary; in time, some types of narrow or more general AI assistants can be brought to the masses. Messenger has great potential to achieve this. I admire what Facebook, as a company with strong culture, has already done, and I believe that it has what it takes to reinvent communication. I’m excited to see how we can make the world even more open and connected all together. 
This article was meant to show where Facebook and Messenger stand right now and which opportunities lay ahead. Let’s hope that whatever comes next will enable entrepreneurs around the world to create innovative services and solve big problems. I always welcome discussions, so shoot me a message with your thoughts on this article!

892,Lora Kolodny,"Ever since Steve Jobs brought the Apple II to the classroom, Apple has created and distributed tech to win over young users where they first learn about computers and coding, their schools. The company announced a continuation of that legacy today at a press event in San Francisco.
There, CEO Tim Cook announced that Apple is donating an iPad and a Mac to 4,500 teachers, and iPads to more than 50,000 students this school year. The company is also putting apple TVs in an undisclosed number of classrooms, he noted.
In June, Apple released an app called Swift Playgrounds to teach young learners how to code for the iOS platform. It also launched coding camps for kids in its retail stores.
Cook today revealed that more than 100 schools and school districts have actually included Swift Playgrounds as part of their curriculum this fall.
And Apple will continue rolling out coding curriculum via a new program called Everyone Can Code.
Cook then introduced Apple’s Vice President of Worldwide Apps Marketing, Susan Prescott, to demonstrate a new, real-time collaboration feature in iWork. The collaborative makeover of iWork could make apps included, like Pages and Keynote, more classroom-friendly.
 
Groups of students or educators could design presentations together in real time with the new iWork, for example. Users can now use iWork apps via Macs, iPhones, iPads or the web, Prescott said.
Apple competes head on with Google Education, globally. It’s iPads versus Chromebooks, Safari versus the Chrome Browser and iWork versus Google Apps in schools from kindergarten through college.
What’s at stake goes beyond simply selling into schools– getting tech into young users’ hands can establish brand and platform preferences for a lifetime.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/apple-liveblog0140.jpg?w=738,connected,"Apple stays in school, donating 54,500 iPads to students and teachers"
893,Matthew Lynley,"Oh boy, here we go — John Hanke, CEO of Niantic Labs, just told the world that Pokémon Go is coming to the Apple Watch on stage at Apple’s iPhone 7 event.
The game has become one of the most successful game launches of all time (if not the most successful game launch of all time). Hinke said Pokémon Go has been downloaded more than 500 million times around the world since it launched. Trainers have walked more than 4.6 billion kilometers while playing the game.
Nintendo shares are going absolutely bonkers following the announcement, spiking immediately following the unveiling on stage. After the announcement, it looks like shares are up more than 20%. Since the launch of Pokémon Go, and now the unveiling of Super Mario Run, shares are up more than 65% in the past several months.

During a walk, users can see how far they walked and how many calories they burned, and see what Pokémon are nearby, and then are alerted when a Pokémon appears nearby. At a Pokéstop, users get a tap on the wrist as well. They can also engage with Pokéstop to get items like Pokéballs and such, and see when eggs hatch.
The walk is one of the unique things that gives Pokémon Go a different way to engage with the game. Pokémon Go invites its users to explore the world around them, constantly offering new experiences with different kinds of Pokémon that may pop up — as well as potentially running into other trainers. So this is an interesting look at not only what focusing on that experience looks like, but also what a core gameplay mechanic might look like on the Apple Watch.
For sure, we’re going to see a lot of game companies jumping on this kind of an idea if it works. Pokémon Go pioneered a lot of new mechanics (well, Niantic did that previously with Ingress) that developers are surely taking notes on for their future games.
This app, along with the new Super Mario Run, signals an increasing intent for Nintendo not only to get its products on new mobile devices, but rethink how those kinds of brands would look on those devices. Pokémon Go represented Nintendo’s first moment in giving companies a new opportunity to come up with titles on mobile devices outside of the traditional 3DS.
The app will be shipping before the end of the year. Be sure to check out the rest of the event on our live blog.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/apple-liveblog0214.jpg?w=738,"iphone-event,iphone","With 500M downloads, Pokémon Go is coming to the Apple Watch"
894,Jordan Crook,"Apple just leaked the iPhone 7 on Twitter.

It’s water resistant. It has new cameras. It has stereo speakers. And it’s available for pre-order in a few moments, available to buy in stores on September 16.

It’s worth noting that Apple is one of the most tight-lipped CE company in the world. The fact that they accidentally leaked one of the biggest announcements of the year is quite surprising.
Of course, we’re in the middle of Apple’s press event, and the official info about the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be announced in minutes. From what we can glean from the tweets, there aren’t any major surprises about the next-gen iPhone, save for the matter of Apple accidentally leaking it.

895,Sarah Perez,"A new application, Callblock, coming to the iTunes App Store, claims to block phone calls from over 2 million telemarketers by type, including things like robocallers, debt collectors, political campaigners, scammers, and more. To identify which calls should be blocked, the app uses a combination of public and private records, ongoing research, and user reports, the company explains. As new entries are added to the database, the app will automatically update to include the changes.
Callblock is the latest release from Rocketship, the bootstrapped and profitable app studio behind a popular mobile ad blocker called Adblock Fast, which today has 750,000 users and is rated 4.5 stars and 4 stars on the Apple App Store and Google Play. The new telemarketer-blocking app is seen as something of a sequel to Adblock Fast, as it also focuses on managing a large database, in an effort to protect end users from annoyances – in this case, unwanted calls, not frustrating online ads.
Using Callblock is a lot like using a mobile ad blocker on iOS. However, instead of going into Safari’s Settings, you head into Settings –> Phone, then toggle the Callblock switch on. In the app, you can then configure which type of calls you want to block, by checking or unchecking its series of rules.

However, be aware that enabling the app or making changes in the app takes 15 seconds to a minute (depending on your iPhone’s chipset) to either load, reload or take effect.
The app takes advantage of the new CallKit API introduced at WWDC earlier this year, which allows third-party apps to integrate tightly with the native Phone user interface.

At launch, Callblock can screen calls from scammers, debt collectors, robocallers, telemarketers, pollsters, political campaigners, charity fundraisers and unknown callers. If a call gets through that should have been blocked, you can report the phone number in the app, too, by tapping “Add Caller.” (You can also correct misclassified numbers.)
This is not the first app to help users handle incoming spam calls – apps like Mr. Number and Truecaller do this as well. However, while those apps do things like showing you who’s calling, have you report spam and create personal blacklists, third-party apps were not able to actually directly block incoming calls themselves until iOS 10. Callblock will be among the first to launch with this new capability.
But if you’d prefer, the app allows you to callerID incoming calls instead of blocking them by default.

According to consumer group Private Citizen, telemarketers make 148 million calls per day – which is why something like Callblock will be welcomed. The new app currently works in 174 countries worldwide, and is launching alongside the release of iOS 10.
In the meantime, users can request early access to the mobile application here, or subscribe to be notified when it comes to other platforms, like Android. The app will eventually offer subscriptions ($0.99/month or $9.99/year) but may feature a one-time promo price as part of its public launch.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-07-at-11-24-56-am.png?w=738,"apps,ios-apps",Callblock’s new iOS app will block calls from over 2 million telemarketers
896,Matthew Lynley,"Pinterest said it has hired Li Fan, the former head of image search at Google, as the company’s new head of engineering.
Much of Pinterest’s most promising technology involves searching for objects within photos and then using that technology to rank and display the most relevant content to users, whether that’s through search or the traditional feed. Users searching for those products may inevitably want to buy them, meaning the products are critical both for its user engagement and commerce products.
That’s increasingly important as Pinterest’s commerce ambitions continue to grow. Offering users the ability to find objects within photos — even through photos they take — can drive them to products they may be interested in inevitably purchasing. In that sense, Pinterest’s visual search (something that Pinterest has quickly distanced itself from the pack with) is becoming one of the best tools that marketers can use to push users closer and closer to a moment of conversion.
Most of Pinterest’s content comes from businesses, whether through the form of promoted content or users simply organically posting products on the service. As a result of that, Pinterest has developed a wide array of advertising tools that helps marketers get their products in front of users at various points in their lives, whether that’s through random discovery, searching or inevitably saving and making a purchase.
Pinterest has also begun rolling out a series of new video-focused tools, both for marketers in the form of advertising products and native videos for Pinterest users. Not surprisingly, a core component of those products will be developing visual search tools for elements within those videos, and continuing to staff up the company with visual search experts is going to be key to those efforts.
The company’s former head of engineering, Michael Lopp, left mid-April earlier this year after joining the company in June 2014. Lopp wasn’t the only engineering departure in the past several years, with Mark Smallcombe serving a ten-month stint as the company’s head of mobile and product engineering.
Fan held senior engineering roles at Google for the past eight years or so, and prior to that was VP of search at Baidu.
So, in the end, a hire like this isn’t that surprising. But what is interesting is, after having a quiet front of the year, Pinterest seems to have started to get very aggressive with new acquisitions and hires. It recently acquired the teams behind Instapaper and Highlight, not to mention a number of smaller companies.",2016-09-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/pinterest.jpg?w=738,pinterest,Pinterest brings on a new head of engineering who specializes in image search
897,"Katie Roof,Matthew Lynley","We’re hearing from sources that Postmates, which is among a few companies that are seen as operating in the difficult on-demand space, is raising at least $100 million in a round led by Founders Fund. Sources stressed that the round has not closed, and that things may change over time.
Despite the challenges of working in an on-demand economy — which can sometimes lead to punishing gross margins and high operational costs — we’ve heard that Postmates is actually in okay shape. Some leaked financial documents earlier obtained by TechCrunch dated last year highlighted gross margins of around 20%. Postmates’ CEO Bastian Lehmann has said before that the company is on track to hit profitability in 2017 — which, at the time we reviewed the leaked documents, we also heard was on track.

For Postmates, this is obviously good news. While the company offers more general product delivery, it’s also clear that restaurant delivery is an aggressively growing space. It’s going to need capital to increasingly compete with those companies. If the company’s financials continue to be healthy, this offers quite a bit of overhead to grow and expand into new markets — including internationally — as well as come up and experiment with new business models that may be loss-leaders at first but prove to be successful in the long run.
Postmates has been busy. It’s working on getting its Postmates Plus unlimited delivery service — in which users pay a monthly fee to get free delivery on orders over $25 — ramped up. Postmates in June lowered the minimum order fee for users to get free delivery from $30 to $25 and expanded to several new markets. So on that front if the company is able to do that, it usually means one of two things: either it’s going well and something seems to be clicking, or the company needs to aggressively attract new users and tweak it in order to figure out the business model. Again, for this case, we hear from the sources it’s the former.
It also gives itself room to run aggressive marketing campaigns to attract new customers — like offering free delivery from Plus merchants on Labor Day — which can also help drive customer loyalty and keep them sticking around instead of jumping to other services. That kind of marketing can be costly, but in the end it can help attract a swath of new customers, and amid increasing competition Postmates has to show it can come up with unique customer acquisition strategies. All this helps keep customers to continue from the service, and if they start to pay more per order, shift to its subscription business model.
There’s another challenge for Postmates, too: keeping drivers and couriers to stick around with the service. You’ll often jump into an Uber, only to find that those drivers are also working for Lyft. In the case of Postmates, there are a lot of other courier options, and Postmates has to nail down the right operational costs in order to keep its drivers happy and its financials healthy. But for a business like Postmates, that can require scale — and having additional financing can help it attract new drivers and keep them around. Postmates still pays its couriers as 1099 workers instead of salaried W-2 workers, but if its business is palatable enough, that may attract workers who are looking for a more flexible schedule even with salaried roles available.
There are also other competitors like GrubHub and UberEats, not to mention some different approaches to food delivery like Sprig. But the company is plenty ambitious, with Lehmann saying last year that the company would expand into London. Indeed, however, many in Silicon Valley view on-demand companies across the board facing challenges, especially with the giant shadow of the $60-billion-plus company Uber above them all. Uber’s ambition is also not to be taken lightly, as this is a company that’s also working on self-driving vehicles.
The sum of this is that establishing growth for businesses like Postmates, which operate best at a large scale, is expensive and requires continued financing, either to continue experimenting with models or attract new customers. The on-demand space is clearly challenging — Uber, which has an obvious challenger in Lyft, alone lost $1.2 billion in the first half of the year, according to Bloomberg. We periodically get glimpses of how well the space is doing, and it appears that investor interest has yet to fade. Yet still, we have yet to see a company in the on-demand space go public.

898,Sarah Perez,"Apple’s recently announced promise to clean up its App Store by removing old, outdated and non-compliant applications could see hundreds of thousands of apps getting booted from the mobile application marketplace, according to new data about the number of abandoned apps live on the storefront today. Apple, of course, didn’t specifically detail its criteria for kicking out older apps – saying only that apps that “no longer function as intended,” “follow current review guidelines,” or haven’t been supported with compatibility updates for “a long time,” could be removed.
That latter item, however – “a long time” – is where there’s room for speculation on the impact this purge will have on the App Store. How long is long, after all? That’s unclear.
Still, it’s fairly surprising how many apps have been released, but not maintained, when you dig into the numbers.
Top, active app developers update their apps at least every month or two, if not more frequently. In fact, a report from last year found that the top iOS developers averaged 45 days in between updates on average. Smaller and indie developers may not have the resources to maintain quite as fast-paced a schedule. But it’s still reasonable to think that an actively maintained app would at least be updated annually, as a minimum, or when a new iOS operating system was released or new hardware arrives.
Most apps aren’t, though.
There are 2.1 million active apps on the App Store worldwide today. But, according to data from Adjust, a business intelligence firm for app marketers, 50 percent of all apps have been abandoned by developers since May 2015. With half the App Store potentially up for deeper examination, Apple’s marketplace could soon look a lot different, following the upcoming purge.

In addition, a quarter (25.6 percent) of all iOS apps haven’t been updated since November 2013, Adjust says. And only 20 percent of apps have been updated in the last three months. This gives you an idea of how few apps are maintained after their App Store debut.
Meanwhile, one group of apps that’s likely to get kicked out of the App Store are those which were never updated to support the larger screen of the iPhone 5 (and subsequent models). Adjust says 11.4 percent of all apps fit this description, and 10 percent of all iOS apps haven’t been touched by their developers since the days of the iPhone 4.
Another way of looking at the situation is to count how many apps are truly ancient and abandoned. According to data from another app intelligence firm, Sensor Tower, 328,000 iOS apps haven’t been updated in three or more years. It wouldn’t be surprising to see all of those put on notice. Meanwhile, Sensor Tower says that roughly 40 percent of apps were updated in the last three months, according to its data, and 7.5 percent don’t support the iPhone 6 or newer.
We’ll soon know how Apple decides which apps it will remove, as it plans to begin reviewing and removing applications from the App Store starting tomorrow – the same day as its iPhone 7 event. Those that crash upon launch will be removed immediately, the company says, while other affected developers will have 30 days after receiving a request from Apple to submit an update, otherwise their app will be removed.

Though Apple’s actions will likely remove a great number of mobile applications, those that disappear largely won’t be missed. Having non-maintained apps that don’t work or even don’t look and feel current contributes to a poor user experience, and it makes finding newer, quality apps more difficult for end users.
The App Store purge is one of several, radical changes Apple has been rolling out to its App Stores in recent months, following the installation of Phil Schiller as the head of the App Store in December. The company also announced the introduction of search ads, new auto-renewable subscriptions with a more favorable rev share for developers, more pricing flexibility for subscriptions, a more personalized App Store which recommends apps users don’t already have installed, and more.
Alongside the App Store purge, Apple also said it plans to limit the way developers can use app names for better App Store SEO – that is, names can’t be longer than 50 characters, so developers can’t cram a bunch of keywords into their app’s title anymore.",2016-09-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/app-store-graveyard1.jpg?w=738,"developers,app-store,apps",Upcoming App Store purge could see hundreds of thousands of apps deleted
899,Sarah Perez,"Ahead of Apple’s iPhone event on September 7th, the company has begun rolling out new, personalized music playlists to Apple Music subscribers, who are beta testing the soon-to-be-released iOS 10 mobile operating system and macOS Sierra. Originally introduced at this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference in June, Apple Music’s new playlists are a direct challenge to Spotify, whose “Discover Weekly” playlist is so popular it saw 40 million users in its first year.
Apple, meanwhile, is taking on “Discover Weekly” with its “My New Music Mix” playlist, which is updated every Friday with new tunes.
This playlist was called “Discovery Mix” when it was shown off at WWDC but, given the rebranding, it seems Apple decided its name was too similar to Spotify’s mix.
“My New Music Mix” is found in the “For You” section of the Music app, and currently offers 25 tracks selected based on your listening history.
The idea here is to expose Apple Music subscribers to more of the sort of songs and artists you would like, based on those you like to play – effectively, the same concept as Spotify’s “Discover Weekly.”
The real question will be which service has the better algorithm? That remains to be seen, as the Apple Music feature only just rolled out this weekend, and no one has had enough time to test it, just yet.
Alongside “My New Music Mix,” Apple Music subscribers on iOS 10 are also seeing the addition of another playlist called “My Favorites Mix,” which updates every Wednesday. This one includes both songs you love “and more,” says Apple, in its description. The “and more” here refers to the fact that the new playlist will use your most-loved tracks as the basis for adding more songs that match those you already like. This offers a different sort of twist on new music discovery, as it subtly mixes in new music with some of your favorite tunes.
As with Spotify, Apple Music customers can subscribe to either playlists and configure them to automatically download the new tracks as they arrive.
The two new playlists are now showing up in the Apple Music app on iOS 10 beta, as well as in iTunes 12.5 on macOS Sierra.
The addition of the playlists is part of a larger makeover for Apple Music, which was criticized for being a bit cluttered in its original design. At WWDC, the company unveiled Apple Music’s new look, which included dropping its social networking attempt dubbed “Connect” from the bottom navigation tabs, and placing users’ libraries in the front-and-center of the application, among other things.
Despite the issues with the earlier layout, Apple Music has presented a formidable challenge to Spotify, just by its nature of being built into Apple’s OS. The company revealed in June it has already reached 15 million paid subscribers. Spotify is still ahead with 30 million paying customers, and 100 million listeners, however. But a revamped Apple Music which comes with better music discovery features could pose a threat.

900,John Mannes,"Earlier this summer I wrote about Mozilla’s efforts to rollout a multi-process architecture, codename Electrolysis, for Firefox. In the months since, Mozilla has completed its initial tests on 1 percent of its user population and the initial numbers are good, according to Asa Dotzler, director of Firefox at Mozilla.
The company is reporting a 400 percent improvement in responsiveness and a 700 percent improvement in responsiveness for loading large web pages.These numbers mean that users are far less likely to see their browser freeze, pause, lag or crash. Dotzler himself used the word “janky” to describe previous versions of the browser.
Over the next week, multi-process will be coming to 10 percent of total Firefox users. For now, users with add-ons will not be getting the new architecture. The staggered rollout is fairly industry standard to avoid shipping bugs. Having two independent groups of users allows Mozilla to benchmark metrics from the new version against unconverted users.
For now, multi-process is limited to a single content process and a single browser process. Later versions will include multiple content processes and sandboxing.
In the coming weeks, Mozilla will push multi-processing to 100 percent of their initial cohort of users. This group represents 40-50 percent of total users. Within the next six months, a majority of users can expect to have the capabilities. Here is a little cheat sheet of upcoming releases:
Over the coming months, engineering teams will be shifting their efforts toward improving security and adding new web developer features.
Teams spent a large amount of time ensuring the new browser would be accessible to as many groups as possible. Bi-directional editing turned out to be a larger project than expected, and users that need right-to-left support will get it in Firefox 49-51.
One of the initial fears of Firefox users was that Electrolysis would be so RAM-intensive that it would severely slow the browser down.
Dotzler noted the memory reduction his teams achieved after spending the last five years on a project called MemShrink. Such a low starting point made multi-process possible. Adding a single additional process added about 20 percent overhead. There are currently no plans to dedicate a process to every single webpage. Right now teams are working to define a fixed number of processes for future rollouts. The question is whether new versions will coalesce pages randomly into a fixed number of processes or coalesce pages by domain.
“We can learn from the competition,” said Dotzler. “The way they implemented multi-process is RAM-intensive, it can get out of hand. We are learning from them and building an architecture that doesn’t eat all your RAM.”
While most may not remember, Electrolisis is not Mozilla’s first attempt to bring a multi-process architecture to Firefox. Six years ago, Project Candle brought a multi-process architecture to Firefox on mobile. The company abandoned the efforts after noticing it was creating a bottleneck on mobile, according to Dotzler.
Today the Firefox mobile browser runs as a single process but with advancements in the processing power of smartphones, it is possible that additional content processes could come to mobile again in the future.",2016-09-02,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-596310178.jpg?w=738,"add-on,mobile-browser",Multi-process Firefox brings 400-700% improvement in responsiveness
901,Sarah Perez,"With the forthcoming arrival of iOS 10, iMessage is finally getting a much-needed revamp that will see it incorporating third-party apps, as well as more engaging and interactive features like message bubbles, animations, handwriting, tapbacks, invisible ink, and more. But unless your friends are also on iOS 10, you won’t be able to use these additions in your group chats. However, a new messaging app called Amity is launching now to bring a similar – perhaps even upgraded – experience, but one that works across platforms.
Based in Brisbane, Australia, Amity’s bootstrapped team of eight has been working to create this more interactive messaging app over the course of the past two years.
As with many messaging clients, Amity offers the ability to send rich media in your chats – that is, things like photos (with filters, naturally), videos, links, voice messages, emojis, stickers, your location and more. But in Amity, you’re able to add these items by tapping buttons in the app itself – you don’t have to switch to another screen or app.
Plus, Amity offers its own collections of custom, original stickers to choose from, eliminating the need for add-on keyboards.
The app can also track of the media you’ve shared in your conversations. A “Memories” section, for example, archives all the photos, videos, links, news articles, YouTube videos, and “postcards” (a feature that involves sharing a location along with crowdsourced photos and other information pulled from Foursquare) in a single place you can revisit anytime.

But what makes Amity really fun are its interactive features. When chatting with the founder by phone this morning, I probably spent half the interview just tapping buttons in the chat app to try out all the different options, I have to admit.
For instance, you can “high five” a friend, which makes an animated version of this gesture appear in your chat, or you can “nudge” them, which actually makes the whole screen appear to shake while your phone buzzes.
Amity lets you ask your friends to send you media, too – you can request for a photo, video or location, with just the press of a button. A timer starts, encouraging  the friend to press another button that appears (e.g. “Send Location”) to respond to your request.

In addition, Amity introduces a feature it calls “Live Mode” which activates whenever two or more people join a chat together on the same screen.
In this mode, you can send live emojis, live touch gestures, and emoji bursts.
You pick from several emojis (e.g. a smiley, hearts, heart eyes, etc.) and then drag the emoji onto the screen where dozens “explode” in a burst-like fashion.
Another experience (see below) is akin to the little “hearts” you send a broadcaster on Periscope or the Likes you send when viewing a Facebook Live video – the only difference is that it’s in chat, not on social media.

Amity was co-founded by Johnny Cheng (CEO), who previously founded a mobile gaming company with 3 million users; Nick Pestov (CTO), the former head of engineering for an e-commerce company; Kieran Harper, a programmer who worked in government; and Jackson Cheng, Johnny’s brother and a designer.
Though only the 1.0 release, Amity comes across as a fairly polished app. (Unfortunately it’s crashing on the iOS 10 developer build, but a recent update has made several of my apps unstable; the team says they haven’t seen this problem on other builds.)
Being immediately engaging and usable is by design, we’re told.
“We set out to come out on day one with something that’s complete and more compelling than anything out there as a starting point – that was really important to us,” says Johnny.
Of course, it’s challenging to get anyone to adopt a new messaging app these days in a world where apps like Messenger, WhatsApp, Snapchat, and others dominate, and where many are fine with using just basic SMS testing or iMessage. Amity’s bells and whistles are incredible and fun, but ultimately, I found myself wishing they were just Facebook Messenger’s new features.
Not to mention, with the upgrade to iOS 10, Amity will have heavy competition from iMessage.
“That was a surprise to us,” admits Johnny, when asked about the upgraded Apple messaging app. After all, Amity had begun its work even before WhatsApp sold to Facebook – it was prepared to offer something fresh and new, but now will have to prove itself against Apple’s built-in messenger.
The company hopes its product is interesting enough to thrive even in this competitive landscape. To help encourage growth, it has added a ton of ways for users to add friends. You can add them by mobile number, invite them from your contacts, add them by username, add them from Twitter, or even add friends who are nearby (as detected via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth).
Amity is now preparing to raise a seed round. Its first investor is Mick Johnson, Facebook’s former Director of Product for Mobile, who offered Amity a five-figure investment.
The app is a free download on iOS and Android.

902,Anthony Ha,"Google’s making it easier for Google Analytics users to find the important trends in their data.
The change is already live in the Google Analytics app for iOS and Android, where, in the Assistant screen, you should now see automatically generated insights.
For example, if your website or app had a sudden jump in new users, Google Analytics will highlight that, and tell you where those new users came from. Or if you’re an e-commerce company, it can tell you which products had the biggest rise in sales.
This is information that Google Analytics was already tracking, but now it’s being surfaced in an quick-to-read card format. So businesses don’t click around to different pages to find the information, and they’re less likely to overlook important changes in the data.
Senior Director of Product Management Babak Pahlavan said that for larger companies that have a data analyst or team of analysts, these insights should help them “scale up.” And for smaller businesses that can’t afford their own analysts, this approach can “bring that same sort of possibility of having these analysts accessible to them and bring in insights that otherwise you would miss.”
Product Manager Ajay Nainani added that the approach was to “take the things an expert does [and] put it into a product … There’s anomaly detection, there’s a combination of techniques to surface stuff.”


Pahlavan also suggested that this is just one step in the evolution in Google Analytics, which is moving towards “more insights, less data.” (The product has also become part of a larger set of marketing tools, the Analytics 360 suite.)
And while insights are just launching on mobile for now, Nainani said Google is working on a desktop web version too.

903,Sarah Perez,"Here’s a stat that’s sure to worry Google: smartphone applications now account for half the time that U.S. users spend online, up from 41 percent back in July 2014, according to a new report from comScore. And when you add tablet applications into the mix, that figure rises to nearly 60 percent.
The new milestone was achieved this July, the report says, and is a testament to our increasing reliance on native mobile applications to deliver us the information we need, as well as the entertainment and distractions we crave – things we used to turn to the web for, in previous years.
This shift towards apps is exactly why Google has been working to integrate the “web of apps” into its search engine, and to make surfacing the information hidden in apps something its Google Search app is capable of handling. 

Our app usage has grown not only because of the ubiquity of smartphones, but also other factors – like faster speeds provided by 4G LTE networks, and smartphones with larger screens that make sitting at a desktop less of a necessity. In addition, the app stores have grown to house millions of downloads – so there really is an app for just about anything you need.

In terms of which apps are most popular, a prior comScore report offers some insight.
The list of top apps by unique visitors is dominated today by the big players, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Pandora, Snapchat and newcomer Pokémon Go.
The apps with the most usage, in order, are: Facebook, Messenger, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Search, Google Play, Gmail, Pandora, Instagram, Amazon mobile, Apple Music, Apple Maps, Pokémon Go, Snapchat, and Pinterest.

What’s surprising about this list is Pokémon’s ranking – something that proves there’s still room for new apps to become giants in what’s now a saturated market. ComScore says that, for as long as it has been measuring digital audiences, there isn’t even a remotely comparable instance of a website or app capturing as large an audience as Pokémon Go did in such a short time.
The closest example was Walmart’s app when it debuted its Savings Catcher, which grew by 4 million users to 24 million over the course of 4 months.
Pokémon Go, however, became the 13th largest mobile app with 55 million unique users (U.S.) across smartphones and tablets in its first month – or more than 30 percent of the total mobile population. It also ranked 4th in total time spent in app, behind Facebook, Pandora and YouTube. Over a third of its users visited the app daily, too.
The latest report from Sensor Tower indicates that Pokémon Go has now surpassed 180 million downloads worldwide, and the average U.S. iOS user is playing the game for 32 minutes per day. It’s also raking in over $4 million in net revenue daily.
While Pokémon may be more the exception than the rule, consumers’ app usage has been steadily climbing over the years.
This figure grew from 34 percent in 2013, to 41 percent the following year and has now reached 50 percent. In the near-term, comScore expects apps to grow beyond the 50 percent mark as well, but says that both desktops and tablets will continue to maintain critical roles in consumers’ lives for the foreseeable future.",2016-09-02,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/shutterstock_186292982.jpg?w=738,,Smartphone apps now account for half the time Americans spend online
904,Devin Coldewey,"Generating speech from a piece of text is a common and important task undertaken by computers, but it’s pretty rare that the result could be mistaken for ordinary speech. A new technique from researchers at Alphabet’s DeepMind takes a completely different approach, producing speech and even music that sounds eerily like the real thing.
Early systems used a large library of the parts of speech (phonemes and morphemes) and a large ruleset that described all the ways letters combined to produce those sounds. The pieces were joined, or concatenated, creating functional speech synthesis that can handle most words, albeit with unconvincing cadence and tone. Later systems parameterized the generation of sound, making a library of speech fragments unnecessary. More compact — but often less effective.
WaveNet, as the system is called, takes things deeper. It simulates the sound of speech at as low a level as possible: one sample at a time. That means building the waveform from scratch — 16,000 samples per second.
You already know from the headline, but if you don’t, you probably would have guessed what makes this possible: neural networks. In this case, the researchers fed a ton of ordinary recorded speech to a convolutional neural network, which created a complex set of rules that determined which tones follow other tones in every common context of speech.
Each sample is determined not just by the sample before it, but the thousands of samples that came before it. They all feed into the neural network’s algorithm; it knows that certain tones or samples will almost always follow each other, and certain others will almost never. People don’t speak in square waves, for instance.
If WaveNet is trained with data from a single speaker, the resulting synthetic voice will resemble that speaker, since really, all the network knows about speech comes from their voice. But if you train it with multiple speakers, the idiosyncrasies of one person’s voice may be cancelled out by someone else’s, the result being clearer speech.
Clear enough that it outperforms existing systems handily, though it isn’t without its quirks — perhaps a few more speakers need to be added to the stew.
It can’t read text straight out just yet; written words need to be translated by another system not to audio but audio precursors — like computer-readable phonetic spelling. An interesting side effect of this is that if they train it without that text input, it produces an unnerving babble, as if the computer is speaking in tongues.
What’s truly interesting, though, is the WaveNet’s extensibility. If you train it with an American’s speech, it produces American speech. If you train it with German, it produces German. And if you train it with Chopin, it produces… well, not quite Chopin, but piano in a logical, one might even be tempted to say creative vein.
Whether it could produce a whole two-minute prelude is hard to say; composition isn’t quite as easy to systematize as basic chords and chromatic agreement.
WaveNet requires a great deal of computing power to simulate complex patterns at this extremely low level, so it won’t be coming to your phone any time soon. If you’re curious about exactly how they arranged their convolutional layers and other technical details, the paper describing WaveNet is available right here.",2016-09-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/shutterstock_302065061.jpg?w=738,"deepmind,neural-networks",Google’s WaveNet uses neural nets to generate eerily convincing speech and music
905,Lucas Matney,"Eighty million people in the U.S. struggle with bad breath — many of them don’t even know that they do, but the people around them are likely all too aware.
Last year at CES, Breathometer teased a connected device called Mint that measures a user’s breath and gives them some tips on how to improve their oral health. At IFA this year, Philips announced that it’s partnering with Breathometer to deliver the startup’s breath analysis system, called Mint, alongside the company’s Sonicare oral health brand in a bundled product suite.
This partnership means a lot for Breathometer, opening the company’s breath analysis tech to millions of Sonicare customers who are mindful of oral care.
After pulling off a successful Indiegogo campaign, the company publicly emerged on the ABC reality show Shark Tank with founder Charles Michael Yim pitching a compact, smartphone-connected breathalyzer that could let people know when grabbing an Uber was a better call than grabbing their car keys after a few drinks. 
As the company evolved, Breathometer saw that the opportunity offered by health and wellness breath analysis far-and-away eclipsed the potential in structuring the company solely around testing for boozy breath. So they pivoted.
Other biomarkers like blood and urine analysis can deliver highly accurate results, but they aren’t the most consumer-friendly when it comes to severe invasiveness. Breath analysis can offer health insights regarding lung health, asthma, metabolic rates, diabetes and others.
“What leaves breath analysis as an open arena — a huge untapped market opportunity — is that its science has been proven, unlike Theranos,” Yim told me. “However, it’s never been properly brought to a consumer market in a user-friendly form factor, connected device experience and so that’s really the opportunity that Breathometer offers.”
The partnership with Philips is huge for Breathometer, given the potential to expand their breath analysis connected device into different areas of health and wellness moving forward. Yim detailed that his company will continue working with Philips on new product areas, but will also be looking at other long-term device partnerships.
For its part, Breathometer opened pre-orders for the $100 Mint in a standalone capacity on its own site last month and will start shipping September 30.",2016-09-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/girl-wide-shot-2_wide.jpg?w=738,breathometer,Breathometer teams up with Philips to take on bad breath

907,Josh Constine,"In just 30 seconds, you can enjoyably consume a viral video or a few Facebook stories. But until now, the shortest thing you could typically listen to was a three minute song, especially when you factor in the time to get your headphones untangled, on, and playing. Hearing anything shorter was more trouble than it was worth.
Yet with wireless earbuds going mainstream thanks to the unveiling of Apple’s AirPods, we’re poised to see an explosion of shorter audio content consumption and creation.

First, it will become much easier to consume short snippets of audio during the in-between moments of life, similar to how we consume visual content today. Waiting in line at the coffee shop, during pauses between public interactions, or whenever we have a spare couple seconds, many of us reach for our phones. We pop open our favorite apps like Twitter or Imgur, and relax with a few scrolls or swipes.
Wireless earbuds unlock this behavior for audio. Without the wires getting in the way, we’ll be more likely to leave them in our ears so they’re at the ready. We could listen to a page or even just a few lines of an audio book or make a little progress on a podcast whenever the opportunity arises.

Longer-term, wireless earbuds that we still take out could be the bridge towards an (essentially) always-in audio technology. With that future in mind, I believe we’ll see shorter-form audio content start to be purposefully created.
Five-minute YouTube clips seemed brief when they first emerged on desktop, but soon enough, mobile gave rise to six-second clips on Vine and social videos optimized for Facebook that catch your eye in the first three seconds as you scroll by. Perhaps AirPods and their contemporaries will usher in a similar shift in audio creation.
Imagine stand-up comedians boiling routines down to snackable one-liners, or playlists that sequence the best short jokes to fill your wireless buds. Apps designed to read you summaries of news articles would grow more ubiquitous. Authors might divide their works into shorter chapters. We could see more mini-songs like the twenty three-second Beatles track “Her Majesty”.  And asynchronous voice clip messaging might replace some our daily texting.
Down the line, simpler interaction with Siri and other apps through voice commands could emerge as the core value of AirPods. Right now, voice recognition is still a bit spotty. As it improves and we grow to rely on voice interfaces, more interactive short-form audio content could take off. If there’s one company I’d trust to build a device that essentially lives in my ear all the time, it’s Apple.

Until we all shift to wireless, Apple ditching the iPhone’s headphone jack may actually make quick audio consumption tougher for some people as they fiddle with Lightning connector dongles for their old headphones. But once we ditch the cords, we can look forward to a new generation of snappy sonic entertainment whispering in our ears.",2016-09-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/airpods-snack1.png?w=738,,AirPods and the rise of snackable audio
908,Darrell Etherington,"The speaker that speaks might soon speak without you speaking to ask it to speak. Amazon’s Echo is set to get push notifications, according to The Information, which would allow it to give you a heads up about activity from its connected services, so it could, for example, tell you when your connected doorbell rings or pipe up and tell you when a loved one’s flight has landed.
Currently, Echo only speaks when spoken to; a user has to use the activation word “Alexa” to prompt it to begin listening for a command or request, and then it’ll respond to said input with its own vocal response. Alexa hasn’t supported the ability to provide any kind of audio notice unprompted as a result of data it receives from a user’s connected services – the closest it comes is being able to sound an alert based on an alarm or timer.
Echo has both audio and visual capabilities, thanks to a light ring that surrounds its upper edge, and The Information suggests Amazon could allow developers access to both for push notifications, so that users can choose how much of an intrusion said notices provide.
Alexa is also a service that exists unbound from the Echo hardware itself, and it’s very possible than any push notification support would extend to other hardware that uses the Alexa API, including the Nucleus smart intercom. The Information says the use of push notices would be part of a larger plan to give developers more control of third-party apps and gadgets overall via Echo and Alexa.
Notifications will be a tricky thing to get right on Echo, since a push alert with voice in a device with no display is a very different thing from a subtle vibration or screen-based alert on a smartphone. Still, it’s a feature that could do very well provided the user has total and intuitive control over when they’re alerted, and how.",2016-09-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/amazon-echo2.jpg?w=738,amazon-echo,Amazon Echo could soon start talking to you unprompted
909,Romain Dillet,"Apple hasn’t mentioned the iPad during its press conference, but it doesn’t mean that the company has no news for the device. The iPhone 7 finally starts with 32GB of storage, and the iPad is also receiving a storage bump.
The 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros already start at 32GB, so only old iPad models are getting more gigs. In particular, the $399 iPad Air 2 now has 32GB instead of 16GB, and the $399 iPad mini 4 also comes with 32GB.
This move also simplifies the lineup a bit, removing some options for the iPad mini 4 and the iPad mini 2, which is still around.
As for the iPad Pro, some options were quite expensive, so Apple is making the most expensive Pro models a bit more accessible. All devices still start at the same price with 32GB, but now you can upgrade to 128GB, 256GB and LTE for less money.
Here’s the new lineup:

910,Romain Dillet,"If $159 sounds like a lot of money for 8 grams, it’s because it is. Shortly after introducing the iPhone 7, Apple unveiled the AirPods. If you’re familiar with the existing EarPods, you’ll feel right at home. The AirPods are like the EarPods, but without wires.
These earbuds come with a built-in W1 chip for audio processing and pairing. According to the product page, they use Bluetooth to transmit audio from your devices. But it’s unclear if you can use them with any Bluetooth device or just Apple ones.
After pairing them with your phone, they’re going to be automatically paired with all your Apple devices that use the same Apple ID. So you’ll be able to seamlessly listen to music on your Mac, iPhone, iPad or even Apple Watch using the AirPods.
When fully charged, you can listen to up to 5 hours of music. You’ll have to put them back in the casing to get some battery life as the case doubles as a battery. Fifteen minutes of charging gives you three hours of battery life. The case holds up to 24 hours of battery life.
There are sensors so that the AirPods know when you put them in your ears. This way, Apple can save battery life. Similarly, the built-in microphones only work when you’re talking. And if you really like the movie Her, yes, you can double tap on an AirPod to trigger Siri.
The AirPods will ship in late October. The iPhone 7 comes with the usual EarPods, but with a Lightning cable.
But that’s not all. Beats is also releasing brand new headphones with the same W1 chip, the same pairing mechanism with your Apple ID.
The BeatsX will be available this Fall for $149.95. These are in-ear earbuds with a cord behind your neck. There’s a built-in Lightning port so you can charge them with your iPhone cable.
The Powerbeats 3 Wireless will also be available this Fall for $199.95. They charge via micro-USB. And the Beats Solo 3 Wireless are available for pre-order now and cost $299.95. It also relies on micro-USB.

911,Devin Coldewey,"Phil Schiller today caused the largest collective eyeroll in the history of the world with his explanation of why Apple was leaving the 3.5mm analog audio jack behind. “It comes down to one word: Courage.”
Well, first of all: come on. Apple was never known for its extreme humility, but presenters usually stop short of blatant self-aggrandizement. Well, maybe not Jony, but the others tend to temper their boasts with a sort of wonder.
Twitter was afire with mirth:
Second, if it’s courageous to remove the headphone port, what is it when you include the ability to restore it in the box? I mean, judged by their own standards, that must be abject cowardice, right?
But it isn’t courage. And Apple has behaved courageously before, at least within the limitations of how courageous a global corporation can be: I think it was courage (and self-interest) that made it fight the FBI the way it has. It was courageous to come out in favor of marriage equality and other civil rights issues.
Removing the headphone jack from the iPhone is not an act of courage, it’s an act of leverage.

The avalanche of gobbledygook Schiller unloaded onto the audience while attempting to justify replacing a 50-year-old standard port with a proprietary interface was meaningless. The Lightning port is totally unsuited to sending and receiving audio.
Audio is so simple to transmit in high fidelity that it can be done with a wire hanger. Using a powered, high-bandwidth data interface adds nothing but cost and complexity, and the space you save is minimal.

The 3.5mm jack is robust, familiar, secure, well-documented, and so on — we’ve seen the argument play out over the last year. You know why it’s good: because it works reliably, worldwide, and with millions of devices. Without Apple’s permission.
See, it’s that last part that must bother them. The idea that someone, somewhere, is doing something with an iPhone that they haven’t anticipated, like making a thermometer or payment system or 3D scanner. Someone who hasn’t paid for a license to attach that thing to their phone.
Apple is taking the first step to make sure that never happens. They’re able to do this because no one can do anything about it. They’re in a position of immense power and they’re using that power to eliminate something good and replace it with something that makes them money. It’s not a conspiracy theory, it’s a business plan.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/courage.jpg?w=738,,Courage.
912,Darrell Etherington,"Sony unveiled a new, sleeker version of its PlayStation 4 today as promised. The PS4 Slim is basically the same as its predecessor inside, but in a smaller shell and with a new price tag at $299 with a retail availability date of Sept 15. The new model is the “standard PS4 going forward,” according to Sony, and will replace the original console hardware.
What they say is almost true: New PS4, same as the old PS4 – at least on the inside. The PS4 Slim offers the same power and internal specs as the original PlayStation 4, and will be completely compatible with all of its available software.
The PS4 Slim also ships with a slightly redesigned DualShock 4 controller with a lightbar re-oriented to better point towards the player, so they can see notifications triggered by in-game events. It’s also dropped the optical port, but otherwise has all the same I/O. It’s around 30 percent smaller than the original PS4, which is a considerable space savings.

913,Romain Dillet,"Now that Apple introduced the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, it’s time to look at this year’s iPhone lineup. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will be available to pre-order on September 9 and will ship a week later on September 16. The base iPhone 7 model with 32GB will cost $649. There will be a 128GB model as well as a 256GB model. Usually, you have to pay $100 more to get more gigs.
The 32GB iPhone 7 Plus will cost a bit more and start at $769. Again, you can pay more to get more storage. You’ll be able to pay $27 or $32 per month to get the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus respectively on carrier installment plans.
The iPhone SE, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are sticking around. This time, Apple is keeping two storage levels for each phone and bumping up the storage as well for the 6s and 6s Plus — 32GB and 128GB. The iPhone SE won’t change, you’ll be able to buy a 16GB and 64GB iPhone SE.
The iPhone Upgrade Plan that was introduced last year is sticking around. So you’ll be able to pay a monthly fee to get an iPhone and AppleCare+ directly from Apple. The iPhone Upgrade Plan is also expanding to the U.K. and China.

914,Romain Dillet,"Apple introduced the iPhone 7 today. It’s 40 percent faster than last year’s A9, and twice as fast as the A8. It’s 240 times faster than the first iPhone. More interestingly, it’s a four-core CPU with two high-performance CPU cores and two “high efficiency” cores that run at one fifth the power to save battery life.
There’s a configuration switch that will route tasks to the powerful cores or the power-efficiency cores. Overall, the iPhone 7 chip uses two-thirds of the power of the previous generation. So the iPhone 7 battery won’t be significantly bigger, but the phone will consume significantly less battery.
Overall, you should get at least two extra hours of battery life for an average day for the iPhone 7 compared to the iPhone 6s.

915,Haje Jan Kamps,"With the newest iPhone 7, Apple is saying buh-bye to a technology that’s been going strong for almost 140 years. It has served us well, but the Cupertino-based maven today announced it decided that enough is enough. The future, it seems, is Bluetooth and Lightning cables.
Apple doesn’t have the, ahem, courage to fully commit this retro-tech murder, however. Hedging its bets, the company includes a dongle in every iPhone 7 box so you can still use, as Phil Schiller puts it, “some analog old connected devices”.
The 3.5mm jack (or “mini jack”, “headphone jack” or “TRS jack”) is a descendant from the quarter-inch jack. It was originally invented to make it easy for telephone operators to make connections on their switchboards back in the 1870s some time. The design is simple and has proven to withstand the test of time. I mean, when was the last time you used tech from 140 years ago?
The little dimple at the front tip of the connector ensures that the plug can be held securely in place by the socket, but also easily removed many times over. The quarter-inch jack in still in use, too, actually — if you’re a guitarist or bass player, you’ll have seen the sockets on your guitar and amp.
The invention was ingenious, and was often referred to as the TRS plug – for Tip, Ring, Sleeve. It is a perfectly round plug can only be plugged in one way (try that with an USB plug!) which meant that operators could plug and unplug the telephone connections without really looking. 
In the 1960s, a smaller, 3.5mm version of the same design was introduced. It was less robust, but suited the brave new world of (semi)portable electronics better. Later on, for applications that needed stereo audio and a microphone, too, manufacturers simply added another ring to the setup, calling it the TRRS (tip, ring, ring, sleeve) and it served faithfully for another number of years.
If 2,500 of our readers are anything to go by, it looks like just over half (55 percent) of those who would consider buying the iPhone would do so even if there isn’t a headphone port, whereas 45 percent responded with a “no, thanks, Apple”.
 
The world hasn’t stood still, and new technologies have come along. Bluetooth headphones are readily available and many other accessories work over Bluetooth and Apple’s proprietary Lightning cable. Apple has a long history of killing off tech it felt was on its way out and we have to give them credit for avoiding port bloat. To wit, its newest Macbook line contains exactly two ports: USB-C and… a headphone jack.
Some — including yours sincerely — feel that the world may be poorer without headphone jacks. That isn’t just because I recently purchased a set of very nice, premium, wired headphones. Many startups and tinkerers rely on the relative accessibility of the 3.5mm jack to hack and develop for smartphones.
The future marches on, relentlessly. Dear mini jack, you had a good run. We’ll miss you.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/20160907-_dsc2336.jpg?w=738,"headphone-jack,iphone-event-2016,iphone-event",Apple kills headphone jack (1878 – 2016). RIP.
916,Haje Jan Kamps,"Apple today announced that the newest generation iPhone will do away with the ubiquitous headphone jack, apparently to make the phone waterproof and to make space for the haptic feedback engine for the home button. Obviously sad news if you just bought an expensive new pair of headphones, but the interface is used for a lot more than just pumping phat beats down your ear tunnels.
From filmmakers to concerned parents, there’s a rich ecosystem of “appcessories” that use the headphone port for two-way communication.
Removing the headphone jack from a phone is problematic; the most obvious reasons have been discussed to death — most succinctly summarized by Owen Williams over on Medium. TL;DR: Bluetooth is a pain, 3.5mm jacks just work.
The humble headphone jack socket has a tremendous advantage over Micro USB, USB-C, Apple’s 15-pin and Lightning adapter and the host of other connectors that have been used on cell phones over the years. It is there, no matter if you’re using Windows Phone, Android, BlackBerry or iOS.
It also sports a surprisingly robust three-channel communication interface: One channel in (for the microphone) and two channels out (for the left and right stereo channel). What not a lot of people realize is that the headphone socket also supplies a tiny amount of power. Not a lot, but the microphone that’s embedded into your innocuous-looking earbuds does need a little bit of power, which can be harvested (pdf) to power, say, a microprocessor in an accessory.
Now take a world of hackers, tinkerers and creative technicians and give them a three-channel interface plus low voltage. What do you get? A rich ecosystem of fantastic little accessories.

Hell, it isn’t even just the small companies that have embraced the simplicity of having a single socket available on all smartphones out there. Square, the company that made it possible for thousands of small businesses to make charges by credit card, is still sending out free magstripe readers to get its customers onboarded onto its service quickly.
 
Apple is frequently highlighting how good its cameras are, most recently with yet another huge Shot on iPhone billboard campaign. It is no surprise, then, that filmmakers are embracing the platform for creating movies.
For filmmakers, it turns out that the camera on modern iPhones is plenty good for shooting  — at least one Hollywood film has been shot exclusively on iPhones. The cameras on the devices are undeniably great, but audio is another matter. For film, you can always use an external sound recorder. The increasingly popular live streaming is quite a different barrel of fish: you need an external microphone.
Products like MicW’s $200 iShotgun, RØDE’s $80 SmartLav and TASCAM’s $35 TM-ST1 all rely on the 3.5mm socket on your device, which means they can be used on all phones and most cameras. Of course, microphone companies have also created Lighting accessories for audio recording, but if a filmmaker is going to splurge $500 on a Sennheiser microphone, they’ll probably want a 3.5mm jack so it can be used with other cameras than just the iPhone.
Plugging fancier microphones into a microphone socket doesn’t seem very revolutionary? Okay, let’s take a look at some of the more exotic uses of the headphone socket.
The iPhone has a lot of sensors built in, but temperature isn’t one of them, so there are a few companies that have created external thermometers. Thermodo’s solution is a perfect example. It started its life with a $330,000 Kickstarter campaign, creating a spectacularly elegant little device for measuring how close you’re going to get to freezing to death on your camping trip.
“I understand why Apple is doing this,” says Thermodo’s CEO and founder, Willi Wu, commenting about how a lack of headphone sockets is going to be problematic. “It’s too bad the consumer gets stuck in the middle. They won’t be able to use their existing headphones and accessories like Thermodo. Apple has now removed the only open standard port available, forcing companies to use their proprietary and royalty based Lightning connector. It would be impossible to make Thermodo as small as it is using the Lightning connector.”
More advanced measuring devices are available, too, including HMB’s eSmogMeter that measures electric fields. There are even fully functional oscilloscope and multimeter appcessories that plug into the headphone socket.
With Bevel, you can use your phone to make 3D scans of the real world. iBlazr brightens your smartphone photos. WeatherPoint claims to be the world’s smallest weather station. FloJack adds NFC reading to your iPhone. Lumu helps your phone pose as a light meter. Pluggy Lock uses the headphone socket to tether your phone semi-securely in place. MyLED adds a Blink(1)-like LED to your phone to enable new types of notifications. The FDA-approved Kinsa’s smart thermometer measures your body temperature. Yuan Yang, a researcher at the University of Berkeley demoed a device that can help practitioners of Chinese Medicine diagnose their patients (pdf).
There’s a tremendously broad array of app-empowered accessories out there that have one thing in common: connecting apps to the outside world via a headphone socket.
I understand how, from Apple’s point of view, locking down its ecosystem even harder than it has been before, the company can make more money. It might even make the argument that building a higher walled garden equals higher security and reliability for its customers. In the process, the company has left behind the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels and the troublemakers.
The point is that by removing the headphone socket and effectively blocking things like Project HiJack, which with easy-to-buy $80 off-the-shelf development kits makes hardware and app hacking easy and accessible, Apple reaffirms that it is fond of rules. Especially its own. It continues to make it harder for indie companies to hack their way to a more interesting future, without having to go through Apple’s borderline draconian MFi approval process. Just curious and want to learn? You’re explicitly out of luck — in its MFi FAQ, Apple tells students and hobbyists that they’re not welcome.
Where Apple goes, other phone manufacturers follow. The tinkerers, hackers and startups of the world will carry the brunt of this decision and I, for one, will grieve the loss.",2016-09-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/apple-liveblog0573-e1473275375251.jpg?w=738,"earphones,headphones,iphone-event-2016,iphone-event","No, really, the headphone jack is more useful than you think!"
917,Devin Coldewey,"As long rumored, the new iPhone — one of them, anyway — has a dual-camera setup on the back. What’s the benefit of this crazy contraption?
One of the cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus has the standard, wide-angle, 28mm-equivalent lens. The other is twice that, a 56mm equivalent — more like a portrait lens. That gives you a hard optical zoom up to 2x — no losing quality just because you want to zoom in a bit. It’ll give you a little haptic feedback when you switch to digital zoom.
But that’s not all! The two cameras, working together, can act like a pair of eyes, gathering stereoscopic data and getting a depth map of the scene. That lets the camera app automatically apply a progressive blur to the background, giving you that shallow depth of field that’s often been indicative of a far more expensive camera.
And you better believe Apple has more plans for this. Depth mapping is a powerful tech, and one that’s been pursued by both Apple and its rivals — we’re only scraping the surface here.
In addition to this, the 7 Plus also has the usual improvements Apple brings to the iPhone camera.

918,Lora Kolodny,"A Princeton, New Jersey startup called Arable Labs Inc. recently unveiled a professional-grade crop and weather sensor that’s solar powered, rugged and was designed by Fred Bould, the creative talent behind the Nest thermostat, smoke and carbon monoxide detector, as well as Fitbit, GoPro and Roku products.
The Pulsepod, which looks something like the head of a small drum or a translucent small frisbee, contains sensing technology including: a six-band spectrometer, 4-way net radiometer, and acoustic rain gauge. It is also solar-powered so it doesn’t need to be plugged in or require frequent battery replacement.
Its sensors enable each Pulsepod to constantly monitor crop growth, or regrowth of grass in a pasture, as well as rainfall, crop water demand, light and heat levels and even the color of berries on the bush, kale leaves, or grapes on the vine, which is important in determining harvest-readiness of the crops.
Arable CEO and founder Adam Wolf said, “Data quality is profound to us. This measures more observation streams than any other embedded device in the world outside of medicine, and is sending data to the cloud where it can be accessed and analyzed in real time.”
The idea for Arable sprang from the founder’s academic research work around forecasting maize growth in Kenya, Zambia and other African markets facing severe drought, along with economic impacts and food scarcity resulting from it, he said.
Growers are already using Arable’s hardware and cloud-based software to figure out harvest timing and the potential yield of what they’re growing.
Early adopters of the company’s software and sensors include: Valley Irrigation, makers of center pivot sprinklers and other equipment for commercial farms; Yara International, the global fertilizer manufacturer based in Norway; Francis Ford Coppola Winery; Treasury Wine Estates; berry growers Driscoll’s; and Blue Marble Microinsurance.
“Timing and yield are very consequential in this business,” the CEO noted. “It takes tremendous coordination of people and resources to make a great bottle of wine, or get organic strawberries onto the shelves of a national grocery chain.”
Designer Fred Bould, who is an equity investor in Arable, said he and a design team from his eponymous design services firm, spent long hours in the field observing farmers, forecasters and other agronomists to understand exactly how they might handle Arable’s technology during their everyday work flow be it in a vineyard, arbors, or a field of lettuce.
“Designing something like the Nest, you don’t have to worry about people throwing it into the back of a truck or dropping it from a post five feet above an almond tree onto packed gravel below,” Bould said.
Bould Design and Arable engineers had to consider how the Pulsepod would work around machinery that’s already in use on farms, too.
Bould recalled, “We watched people harvesting strawberries, and saw equipment that passes over rows of plants. We saw picking wagons where people walk behind them, and put strawberries into containers on them. We saw Mad Max-like machines that chop things down that are sticking a few feet above a vine. And we asked ourselves where can we position this so it won’t get disintegrated into 1,000 parts.”
The Arable also had to be easy to set up and durable enough to be working in 3 years in the same position in the field, Bould said.
The final device includes a port which allows users to connect it to other hardware, for example, cameras or auxiliary sensors.
Wolf said longer-term, the Arable could be utilized beyond agriculture, for example, to help cities manage urban flooding, water quality or fires. But for now the company remains focused on the needs of food farmers.
In addition to its hardware, Arable offers a cloud-based app and developer tools including an API to help farmers and business that work with them to do custom forecasting, modeling and analysis of the data they gather on the ground.
The company aims to reduce food waste around volatile, perishable commodities, and ultimately to make farming predictable, Wolf said.
Arable has raise $1.5 million in angel funding and $4 million in non-dilutive grant funding from the National Science Foundation for the research that gave rise to the Pulsepod.",2016-07-18,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/arable_pulsepod.jpg?w=738,"fred-bould,adam-wolf,arable","Arable’s crop and weather sensor, Pulsepod, aims to make farming predictable"
919,Ron Miller,"Big Data by all accounts is supposed to help humans perform better by augmenting our limited brain power. Computers, after all, have the ability to crunch data with lightning speed, something humans just haven’t been built to do.
Conventional tech wisdom states that the more data you have, the better the outcome — even if that sounds counter-intuitive. That’s the thinking behind the NSA hoovering up as much data as they can get their hands on. With more data should come deeper understanding, but what happens when there’s too much data and it surpasses our human ability to understand it in a given moment?
Chances are that too much information running through our small brains clouds our thinking, making it more difficult to do our jobs. Computers can slice and dice data with great precision, coming up with meticulous details about a given situation, but it could be another matter for mere humans who are left to process that data and apply it to our work.
That’s because we can only deal with so much data, even when the machine is filling in for our limitations. We may have a handful of things we can keep in our brains at once, at least at the moment we are trying to be effective employees and do the job to the best of our abilities with the data the machines have been kind enough to supply for us.
By all accounts, machines can get us so far, but it is left to us as humans to take that information and process it to make meaningful connections.
As a great real-life example, baseball has become a sport dominated by data. Former major league baseball player, Tony Clark, who is currently head of the MLB Player’s Association put it well when he told Nick Cafardo of the Boston Globe, “There is value in having information. There is a danger in having too much of it.”
Baseball players are like the rest of us, except they have to hit a baseball being thrown at 90+ MPH. Despite their great talent, they have to take this great information provided by the stats geeks in their organization, and use it to the best of their ability to hit the baseball. The problem as Clark puts it, is that there is a case of too much data while trying to do the job.
Players, like all of us, have a plan on how to execute their jobs. It helps to have good data to build that plan, but you have to cut through the noise and get to the most important nuggets that will help you execute at the highest level.
 
As Clark put it, “Unfortunately, knowing what pitch he throws on Tuesday day games, on turf, the second week of each month, has no value to me. So you can put yourself in a position where I have so much information I can’t move, I can’t function, I can’t game plan in a way that allows me to perform the way I need to perform,” Clark told the Globe.
That kind of exaggeration has a ring of truth to it as we go forth into the world of increasing amounts of data. Yes, machines can process that data and spit out all kinds of esoteric data points, many of which actually have little value.
The challenge remains finding the wisdom in the data to do our jobs. Perhaps artificial intelligence will help in that regard, but ultimately it’s about finding the data that matters — whether that’s the right approach at the plate for a baseball player, the best customer to target or the new product idea to implement for a company or even government security agencies finding the greatest likelihood of a terrorist attack.
Whatever the outcome, the data has no inherent value unless it produces an outcome to help us perform better — and finding the data that matters most is still a huge issue.",2016-07-17,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/shutterstock_138439007.jpg?w=738,"mlb,big-data",Too much big data running through my brain
920,Len Shneyder,"

We all took a collective gasp when we saw the price tag of Microsoft’s acquisition of LinkedIn. Now that the dust has settled a bit, we can pause and reflect on what this means from a data, privacy and email perspective — given that all three are potential strengths, weaknesses and concerns arising from the merger of two giants.
While at a conference recently, I sat down with my colleague and friend, Dennis Dayman, chief privacy officer at Return Path, and discussed how this deal could change the B2B data landscape. Here’s what he had to say.
Len Shneyder: What did you make of this deal when you saw the announcement?
Dennis Dayman: At first I wasn’t sure what their plans were outside of an existing partnership. The more I thought about it, the more I began to realize Microsoft, like Google and other enterprises, really lacks a real social media presence or product. On the other hand, LinkedIn is a company that doesn’t make operating systems or business software, yet they’re at the forefront of enabling the people who do. So then what are the competitive advantages for these two behemoths joining forces? Why would Microsoft want LinkedIn, and how would they use it as a competitive advantage against Apple?
LS: Is that a rhetorical question? At $26 billion, the acquisition is much more than a checkbox. Apple doesn’t have a social platform per se, but some may perceive them as a social enabler: The App marketplace is a kind of social landscape, music is a socially engaging medium, as are movies — these are culturally significant and drive social engagements. But I think I see what you’re saying.
DD: Right now, Google has lots of data on users of their Google Apps product line for B2B clients and Google doesn’t sell or share that out to anyone; on the flip side, we know that Microsoft has lots of data on users in their Office 365 product line… it’s an interesting parallel when you think about it.
LS: Very true, I hadn’t thought of it that way. So what’s in it for Microsoft? Does this help them go toe-to-toe with the social giants or the operating system platforms?
DD: I think it’s more about Microsoft wanting to know you, the B2B user, and how you engage with business productivity tools. Additionally, the connections you make and maintain in the world serve as a kind of social launching pad for the products and platforms you use on a daily basis. From the content side, who you are talking to, and what you are talking about are equally important. Having all that information positions Microsoft better in today’s competitive B2B computer market, B2B collaboration, B2B operating systems market and the hottest market of them all: cloud computing.
LS: So at the end of the day, data is king, it’s always what’s most important and LinkedIn represents a kind of B2B social intelligence that Microsoft only had in the form of usage data through Outlook 365. They knew how people worked with their products, but they didn’t know what they were saying about their products and what those conversations meant in light of their products.
DD: Absolutely! This brings them up to par with Google. Google’s products are free, their email service is free and free is always awesome in my book. Google’s cloud already has an expansive network of users.
LS: How does Google’s cloud stack up against Azure? Or does this even matter?
DD: I’m less interested and concerned about the direct cloud-to-cloud comparison of Azure versus Google. What we have to realize is that the merger gives Microsoft access to a plethora of already involved users with lots of “cloud” data and the ability for those B2B users to easily share their Office 365 work product with many others outside of their company’s user base. It gives Microsoft the ability to know who you might be working with, partnering with or just plain sharing data with.
If you look at what the popular email client CloudMagic has done with their “Sender Profile” feature that provides users a button labelled “Know More” after receiving or sending an email, you can see the sender’s organization, location, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter profiles of that based purely on their email address. Can you imagine the power and ability within any Microsoft controlled email product like computer-based Outlook or the cloud-based Office 365 knowing more about the sender of the message? Taking it up a notch, what could Microsoft do or build if they knew more about what sorts of B2B emails you get daily? What your company needs based on received content? This puts Microsoft RIGHT into the B2B data analytics game that many of their competitors are already in.
LS: I think you’re onto something. Google released Inbox by Google, which was an algorithm designed to organize the clutter of your inbox. Email is so terribly personal that I don’t think it ever really took off; we’ve all been using email for a long time and have our own human-driven algorithms. And IBM announced Verse, which was a kind of inbox manager, as well, but it seems to have morphed into a quasi-business/social collaboration tool. Isn’t there a cautionary tale in these two product lines that have seen very little pickup?
DD: Absolutely, but I think IBM had no real foundation in the email space to launch Verse. Inbox management apps are really a B2B tool and probably won’t see too much traction among B2C, so I’m not surprised that Inbox by Google is in a kind of limbo between the two.
The Microsoft deal is much more pointed and focused; it adds a new interesting spin to LinkedIn’s features and would start allowing the app to report your location similar to how the Google Maps app regularly reports and stores location history for the day. Geo-location would add a unique dimension to Microsoft’s data in addition to the social chatter of LinkedIn. Microsoft could ask and answer questions like which corporate titles are traveling more than others? What might be interesting markets that certain people are traveling to? What is being said in that marketplace and what tools if any are being used? What happens if Microsoft’s CEO all of a sudden starts showing up at 37.4233111, -122.0706458 (LinkedIn HQ GPS coordinates). Could it be about a partnership, merger or just plain lunchtime golf?
All this location information makes Microsoft better positioned to sell their products to companies AND opens a secondary data market to sell access to research and analytics firms hungry for this kind of focused B2B data. Airlines and hotels have to be excited at the prospect of learning more about their business travelers. Insights like where to build the next hotel and more information about business routes to add or hubs to build out could be mined and explored through this kind of data. Past travel history, conference attendance, etc. could all be gauged long in advance because people discuss it on social platforms like LinkedIn; smart vendors just need access to a rich source of data.
LS: Not to rain on your parade, but the scenario you described above has all kinds of crazy data and privacy implications. I don’t think half of the rosy future you described above would pass muster in the EU. Privacy hawks are, as we speak, sharpening their talons to sink them into the flesh of any future intel products, don’t you think?
DD: As awesome as it is for B2B marketing and marketers, you’re right, there are some needed product enhancements and permissioning that has to occur before any of the ideas I’ve mentioned can be brought to market. Many security and privacy people will want to review the app as it does change and, as they probably do, all new vendors or applications that are installed on their computers and mobile phones. That’s the easy part. Sort of like how users of Google Apps Collaboration cloud gives users full control of who can view, edit and own documents and more importantly be able to primary share first with their organization and co-workers before outsiders. My company ran through this exact assessment to ensure we weren’t leaking data once we made the jump to the cloud.
I also think that this won’t be an issue for the merger to continue here in the United States when it comes to antitrust issues or more importantly privacy issues. I think the European regulators will want to look at any changes or use of data by Microsoft with a magnifying glass (and maybe even an electron microscope) ensuring that the proper data transfer and use mechanisms are in place and that end users have been given the consent, notice, choice and control over their information that is expected and required. I’m sure Microsoft, being a leader in the privacy space, won’t have many problems ensuring they’ve given the end user the protection they deserve and are entitled to by law. Microsoft declared its support for the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and has been a huge leader and supporter of privacy through the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP).
LS: So taking privacy off the table, and the business strategy, what do you think Microsoft is trying to do from an end-user perspective? How are they trying to make our lives better?
DD: Microsoft says they are simply trying to alleviate business people from having to go back and forth between productivity tools and social networks; I believe that to some degree. This may have been where they started, but it’s not a guarantee that this is where they’ll wind up once they all dive into the technology and ferret out the true value of what they have.
LS: Will this merger make LinkedIn more secure? Or let me rephrase it; LinkedIn has lots and lots of data, and now that this data will be exposed and used by Microsoft, does this automatically paint a giant target on both companies?
DD: I’ve said it many times, the increase in security breaches is not about just having the data, but in how hackers will want to use that data to continue sending out nefarious things like spam, phishing and ransomware. The first step in doing bad things with email is compromising users, but if you can compromise a company, then you have more than just an address, you have the means by which to steal an identity.
The huge acquisition uptick in the marketing vertical over the past five years is intentional. Data, no matter how it’s obtained or used, is the new gold standard. As the world becomes ever more data-driven, smart businesses look to fully realize the benefits of the data revolution, from streamlining internal processes and communicating more ably with current and potential customers, to lowering costs and creating jobs. However, all of these potential future scenarios have to be tempered with a strict application of best practices security and data privacy.
As far as what you and I do, Microsoft is getting instant access to a mountain of user data, including contact and device preferences, demographics, brand and organizational affiliations and even company-level marketing spend metrics. We know how powerful detailed data can be as market research firms, hedge funds and retailers have all shown great interest in our item-level consumer receipt data. What LinkedIn delivers is data with proven practical applications (sell more LinkedIn ads or messages or whatever). One challenge will be convincing advertisers Microsoft will remain a neutral party (i.e. not muck with competitor ads and recruiting efforts).
Satya Nadella has already said they will not make sweeping changes to the platform and Weiner will retain great autonomy. That’s probably a smart move, and actually would be helpful to the users of it. However, what I’ve said throughout this Q&A is that they will change the underlying data-sharing technologies like GPS tracking or data reporting that the average user doesn’t see or really “care” about. That may be one of the biggest game changers to come out of this acquisition.",2016-07-16,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/linkedin-microsoft.png?w=738,acquisitions,"The email, data and privacy implications of Microsoft’s acquisition of LinkedIn"

922,Anthony Ha,"Legion Analytics is looking to make your sales team more productive with the help of artificial intelligence.
We covered the startup last year when it was part of Y Combinator’s fellowship program and offered to help companies find sales leads. CEO Jamasen Rodriguez told me that the company’s vision has expanded — it’s not just focused on lead generation anymore, but rather becoming “a full-stack sales company.” And part of that vision involves automating the mundane parts of the sales process.
Bots are a pretty trendy topic right now, and Legion Analytics’ claim of using natural language and machine learning technology is pretty familiar, too. What’s different, according to Rodriguez, is the way the company’s technology can analyze text and “understand the sales meaning of that text.”
The idea isn’t to replace salespeople entirely, but rather to free them from a lot of the more time-consuming back-and-forth over email of answering basic questions and scheduling demos. That, in turn, should allow a single sales rep to pursue many more leads at one time.
In fact, Rodriguez said his company has already been using the A.I.  sales rep (which it calls Kylie) to promote its own products. How human does Kylie sound? Well, Rodriguez said the technology even understands rudimentary small talk — if you mention a child’s soccer game, Kylie will ask about the game later on. And he said one of the prospects actually started flirting with her.

That also brings up another question: Should potential customers be told that they’re interacting with a bot? Rodriguez said the goal is to be as human-like as possible, so you probably don’t want to spill the beans right away. At the same time, he has told customers the truth about Kylie later on — after all, it’s kind of a selling point for his company. He suggested that each company using Kylie will probably want to make that decision on their own.
Rodriguez is now looking to test out Kylie with a variety of companies and industries.

For early- to mid-stage B2B software and SaaS companies, selling in to the enterprise is hard. Getting a lot of enterprise customers to pay for your solution on a repeated and long-term basis without seeing your sales growth stall out at $15-25 million ARR? That’s really hard.
Welcome to the challenging world of enterprise sales.
Companies like Salesforce, Workday, NetSuite and athenahealth found lasting B2B sales success and turned their companies into pillars of the enterprise SaaS ecosystem. But the majority of private enterprise companies still face this Mount Everest of a challenge. Many factors can slow a company’s B2B sales progress, including competitive challenges, timing issues and product deficiencies.
Here are three big sales mistakes we see private enterprise software companies make:
George Mathew, president/COO of Alteryx says, “In today’s enterprise software market, it’s important to define a user experience that is 100 times better than the status quo.”
There are a number of reasons for this, including the fact that inertia, incumbency and bureaucracy are all working against you. For emerging companies, this means finding a way to be exponentially better with fewer resources. As a result, focus is key.
Yammer co-founder David Sacks addressed this when he took over as CEO of Zenefits earlier this year. “Companies execute better when they ruthlessly prioritize and sequence their efforts,” Sacks wrote. “For us, that means hyper-focusing on the small business market where we have product-market fit.”
What does this mean — “hyper-focusing … where we have product-market fit”? It means pursuing those market segments for which your product has a unique and compelling solution — exponentially better than the status quo — and pursuing only those segments.
Many private B2B companies have developed solutions that are working for a subset of customers, but are still challenged with sales cycles longer than ideal. Average revenue per customer remains below the target. Or new customer sales growth is incremental, not exponential. In other words, the product-market fit is not compelling enough.
Sometimes the market-fit issue with developing enterprise companies stems from insufficient focus. Ruthless prioritization, as advocated by Sacks, does not come naturally. Market fit can improve from having more ongoing dialogue with customers. For targeted sectors, your solution may simply be just a nice-to-have service and not compelling enough to overcome typical enterprise barriers.
With more market focus, however, companies can find a sweet spot by developing an acute understanding of customers’ needs in a particular segment, which is more nuanced than the broader sector requirements. To succeed, resist the urge to broaden your focus too much or too soon, and then scale proportionately.
Competitors come in many different shapes and sizes. As Zendesk CEO Mikkel Svane says, “There’s an incredible variety of software products out there.”
Indeed, read the “About Us” section of all the companies in your market universe, and consider how many of those view your space as theirs. Your competitors include other private companies and larger established incumbents with massive sales organizations. You also compete with customers’ own internally developed efforts, which may be inferior but can be difficult to overcome given ties to their own solution.
Competition also includes service and reselling companies that represent third-party vendors.
AppDirect co-CEO Daniel Saks points out that 70 percent of on-premise software sales have traditionally been channel-based. He adds, “80% of on-premise software vendors operate a channel program to enable other companies to sell their products, while only 20% of SaaS vendors operate similar programs.”
This channel and reselling hurdle highlights a competitive challenge for SaaS companies facing off against traditional software vendors. It’s a zero-sum game among vendors, so signing a customer means a loss for someone else.
One often overlooked step is simply engaging with customers about the competitive landscape — including prospective as well as won/lost targets. Invest time to glean important, insightful information about your competitors and adapt accordingly.
With enterprise sales, timing can make or break a company. Bad timing in the B2B sales process can stem from several factors. Here are three common timing issues:
Timing problem No. 1: You’re behind the market demand curve with a not-exponentially-better product — and losing to competitors or incumbents.
If you don’t give customers sufficient reasons to make a change, you will encounter too much inertia to close business. The enterprise customer’s default action is to stick with their current solution. Be aggressive in solving this problem by uncovering more unique, urgent requirements, and then credibly and proactively addressing those. More target market focus and customer-driven product iteration can help you move ahead of the curve.
Timing problem No. 2: You’re ahead of the market demand curve and struggling to close sales.
Enterprise markets can be unwelcoming to pioneers, so consider finding ways to bridge an entrenched solution to your ahead-of-the-curve solution. For example, TigerText introduced a secure enterprise mobile messaging platform to healthcare customers in 2010 but faced resistance from hospital employees that still relied on pagers. To overcome this, they developed a messaging solution that included paging options. To get your foot in the door, you may need to support valued but possibly outdated requirements to help companies transition to your platform.
Timing problem No. 3: You’re suffering under the weight of a long sales cycle and not closing enough deals quickly enough.
SaaS products and business models have shortened sales cycles in some sectors for a number of purchases in recent years (e.g. see Harry Stebbings’ interview with Immediately’s CEO Branko Cerny). This is not true for all purchases in all enterprise markets, however, including large purchases in regulated industries or many Global 2000 companies.
What to do about those long and costly sales cycles?
“Selling to the consumer is about selling positive emotions. Selling to the enterprise is about suppressing negative emotions,” says GoodData CEO Roman Stanek. “Enterprise IT is not a culture of early adopters.”
He is right — but there are a few practical strategies that can get slow-moving targets to move.
Employing best practices with your sales and marketing processes is critical. In many Global 2000 companies, there are multiple groups of decision-makers or influencers involved, including product users, IT gatekeepers, administrative or executive groups and compliance teams, any of which can slow down your sales process.
With incomplete information flowing back to the sales team, it’s critical to measure and track all customer communication and best practices by carefully utilizing your CRM and marketing automation tools — and then managing your team accordingly. Work to build a company wide culture to document customer communications and make best practices repeatable across sales, marketing, customer success and business development teams.
Also, there are countless times that we have seen large, long-term enterprise deals go to a competitor that has successfully triangulated the buying process or leveraged backchannels. Your team’s success in triangulating with customer targets and establishing backchannels of communication with friendly insiders is vital to winning long sales-cycle deals.
In fact, even though your product is B2B, perhaps the biggest mistake you can make is forgetting that your sales process is still P2P (peer-to-peer). Executives make decisions for all sorts of reasons that are not based simply on product features or depth of IP. With a long sales cycle, building rapport at many levels in the customer organization chart is critically important. Mastering these softer P2P skills can help drive successful triangulation and backchanneling, which lead directly to more enterprise sales.
“We’ve seen that successful enterprise sales stem from a variety of factors,” says Nick Elprin, CEO of Domino Data Lab. “But in closing the largest and most important deals, people skills are ultimately at the top of that list.”

924,Ingrid Lunden,"Google has made another small acquisition to help it continue building out its latest efforts in social apps. The search and Android giant has hired the team behind Kifi, a startup that was building extensions to collect and search links shared in social apps, as well as provide recommendations for further links — such as this tool, Kifi for Twitter. Terms of the deal are not being disclosed, but, according to Google engineering director Eddie Kessler, the app’s team will be joining the company to work on Spaces, Google’s group chat app.
Google tells me it is not commenting on the exact number of people joining.
It looks like Spaces could use the help. The app launched earlier this year and has had a very lukewarm run in the market so far, currently lingering around 577 in the U.S. iOS App Store and 284 in the U.S. Android store, according to stats from App Annie.
This is essentially an acqui-hire. In a Medium post earlier today, Kifi noted that the app is not coming to Google. It will only remain alive for another few weeks, after which point it will stick around for a few weeks more for data exports only.
While the app is not living on, it sounds like the kind of tech that Kifi’s team — co-founded by Dan Blumenfeld and Eishay Smith (although Blumenfeld left the company some time ago) — will continue. Considering Space’s current focus on group chat, it sounds like this means they could tweak Kifi’s link sharing and link recommendation technology to use them in that context, and to be able to collate them with links from other applications and platforms.
This seems to be what Kessler says will be the intention, too, in his own short Google+ post: “Delighted the Kifi team, with their great expertise in organizing shared content and conversations, is joining the Spaces team to build features that improve group sharing.”
Google has disclosed nearly 200 acquisitions to date. Among them, other recent M&A moves that point to Google building up its talent in areas like social and apps include Pie (a Slack-like app) in Singapore and Moodstocks in Paris (to improve image recognition in apps).

925,Sarah Perez,"Microsoft announced this morning a new program aimed at expanding Surface’s footprint in the enterprise, dubbed “Surface as a Service.” The initiative will allow businesses to lease Surface devices, alongside subscriptions to Office 365 and Windows 10. The company says this will allow customers to benefit from access to the latest hardware as well as faster device refresh cycles.
Surface has been a growing business at Microsoft, the company also notes, having grown in the past year from generating $1 billion in revenue per year to $1 billion per quarter.
More recently, Microsoft has been focusing on expanding Surface beyond the consumer market. Last fall, for example, it partnered with Dell and HP to sell the Surface hardware through its commercial sales organization. Today, it announced two more partnerships with IBM and Booz Allen Hamilton, who will now become Surface solution integrators.
IBM will deliver industry-specific solutions for the financial services and consumer packaged goods sectors that take advantage of Surface’s unique hardware capabilities, Microsoft says, while Booz Allen Hamilton will focus on solutions for government, the public sector and healthcare.
The new “Surface as a Service” program is meant to offer a different way of bringing the device into the enterprise, beyond these traditional reseller programs. Details were light on how the subscription service will work, but it will be made available to Cloud Solution Providers who are also Surface Authorized Distributors.
The program is initially being launched with ALSO, a Cloud Solution Provider in Europe, but Microsoft says it will expand the program worldwide.
For organizations with Surface as a Service, the benefit of the subscription service is that their devices will always get updated with the latest releases of Windows 10 and Office 365.
The program’s launch also follows the recent unveiling a Surface Membership program, which lets consumers buy Surface devices by making low monthly payments. The plan was also aimed at businesses, not consumers, and offered access to Surface Book, Surface Pro 4 and Surface 3 models. It included free upgrades when new models became available.
In addition to the subscription service, and new Surface resellers, Microsoft also adding CDW, SHI, Insight, and Zones to its Surface Multi-National Purchasing Program. That makes it easier for businesses to put Surface devices and accessories on their company-wide purchasing lists with the resellers.",2016-07-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/microsoft-surface-pro-4-stylus-detail.jpg?w=738,"surface,enterprise",Microsoft debuts “Surface as a Service” program aimed at getting devices into the enterprise
926,Ron Miller,"Sisense, a company which helps customers link multiple data sources and summarize them in a single dashboard view, has been working on ways to understand the data outside of the context of a computer.
Today, the company announced an initiative called Business Intelligence Virtually Everywhere. That could involve asking questions to a voice-driven system like the Amazon Echo or linking important Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to an intelligent lightbulb that changes colors to represent the current state of the KPI — for example, green for meeting the metric, orange for being in danger of falling short, or red for missing it.
What Sisense has found in early trials, according to CEO Amir Orad, is that customers have a much more emotional connection to the data when it’s presented this way. He said one executive he spoke to comes in each morning, and before she unpacks her bag, she checks the color of the lightbulb. With that, she already senses whether it’s about to be a good day or a bad one, even before she’s opened her laptop.
A few months ago, Sisense engineers began experimenting with finding ways to connect with Sisense data outside of a computer screen. One of the earliest ideas was Echo integration.
Imagine being able to ask meaningful questions about your most important business metrics: “Alexa, what are the daily sales figure for today?” or “Alexa, what was our revenue last quarter?”
James Levine, a Sisense customer from Act-On Software, has been using the Echo integration. While he was familiar with the device in a consumer context, he said that he had a hard time picturing how it would function at work until he actually used it to monitor key performance indicators. He found that people were really engaging with it, and he saw usage go up at the end of the quarter as they wanted to be sure they were meeting their sales goals.
He has also been using the light bulb system to monitor customer hold times. Looking up and seeing the light bulb is red is a clear signal that there is a problem and it needs to be addressed immediately.
As for the future, Levine would like to see these items linked together instead of a single instance of the smart bulb. “I would like to set up a switch board or color coded light bar to tell us more than one thing, to get a general sense of the business,” he said.
That could happen down the road, but for now, the initial integrations are a pretty cool starting point.",2016-07-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/25-amazon-echo.png?w=600,"natural-language-processing,amazon-echo,business-intelligence,sisense",Sisense-Amazon Echo integration lets you ask Alexa questions about your business data
927,Ingrid Lunden,"Here’s an interesting twist in one of the bigger enterprise acquisition stories of 2016. After Mitel earlier this year announced that it would acquire Polycom for $1.96 billion and consolidate the two companies’ enterprise communication businesses, today private equity firm Siris Capital has come in with a higher offer: it has agreed to acquire Polycom for $2 billion in cash and take it private, working out to $12.50 a share. The deal is dependent on Polycom cancelling its deal with Mitel, which Siris and Polycom both say that it has done.
“Polycom has informed Siris that its Board of Directors has unanimously determined Siris’ offer to constitute a ‘Company Superior Proposal’ under the terms of its merger agreement with Mitel,” a statement read. “Polycom has also announced its intention to terminate promptly its merger agreement with Mitel, subject to the terms thereof.” Polycom’s market cap as of this morning is around $1.47 billion.
It’s a somewhat abrupt turn of events, considering that Mitel and Polycom were in negotiations for 10 months before announcing their deal back in April. However, there were reports in past months that an unnamed private equity buyer was also interested.
On a wider scale, there have been a number of consolidation plays in the enterprise IT market, which has been shaken up by the emergence of a host of smaller and very popular new services that do the same job but without the costly hardware. These include services like Slack and Microsoft-owned Skype, but also many others. Apart from these, there are other competitors in the form of larger comms businesses Cisco and Avaya.
A merger seemed in keeping with that wider trend, especially considering that Mitel and Polycom had complementary businesses. Mitel is perhaps best known for its IP telephony solutions, including PBX systems, while Polycom is a leader in conferencing services.
Also consider the number of other M&A moves that have been made, which have included Cisco acquiring enterprise collaboration startup Acano for $700 million; IBM buying Ustream and Clearleap for enterprise conferencing; and Atlassian acquiring BlueJimp.
So, in that sense, in addition to the offer being a relatively marginal $40 million higher (but net $20 million lower since there is a $60 million termination fee on the Mitel deal) and being all-cash, making it more attractive for shareholders, the Siris offer is significant for another reason. It will keep Polycom — one of the giants in video and voice conferencing — as an independent operation — regardless of what happens to that operation in the future as part of a portfolio of other telecoms interests owned by a private equity giant.
“Polycom has a 25-year history serving the audio and video collaboration needs of the most demanding enterprises and is a globally recognized brand synonymous with innovation and the highest quality. We are very excited for the opportunity to partner with Polycom and its leadership team, as the Company fits well with Siris’ investment focus on mission-critical telecommunications businesses,” said Dan Moloney, Siris Executive Partner, in a statement.
“The industry is transitioning to a hybrid on-premise and cloud-based Unified Communications environment. We believe that as an independent private company, Polycom would be best positioned to continue its heritage as a best-in-class communications solutions provider to more than 400,000 companies and institutions, channel partners, and the evolving Unified Communications ecosystem.”
How long Polycom will remain as-is under Siris’ wing is another question. As with other PE firms, PE has a track record of buying up, sprucing up, and selling off communications assets. Current companies in its portfolio include Digital River, collaboration software vendor PGi, and digital communications group Xura, which it acquired in May for $643 million. It has some very experienced people working in its team, including Nokia’s former head of feature phones Mary McDowell, who joined Siris earlier this year as an executive partner.
Siris says the deal will be financed by way of equity and debt, but it doesn’t specify the proportions. The debt will come from Macquarie Capital. The offer will be in place until July 15, but it appears to be a done deal in terms of the commitments outlined by Siris and Polycom in its announcement.",2016-07-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/shutterstock_108184730.jpg?w=738,"enterprise-collaboration,mitel,siris-capital,polycom","Siris Capital to buy Polycom for $2B in cash, Polycom cancels its $1.96B Mitel merger"
928,Ron Miller,"In a blog post this morning, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that long-time COO Kevin Turner would be leaving after 11 years at the company.
At the same time, Citadel Securities announced on its website home page this morning that Turner would be coming on board as CEO.
Nadella gave the expected platitudes in the announcement, while thanking Turner for his service to the organization.
“He built the sales force into the strategic asset it is today with incredible talent while at the same time more than doubling our revenue and driving customer satisfaction scores to the highest in company history,” he wrote in the blog post announcing Turner’s departure.
Turner was actually a key figure at Microsoft and was involved in everything from sales and marketing to product development, and after over a decade at the company in which included many changes internally and in the industry at large, perhaps he was ready to move on to a new challenge.
In fact, his job was so integral to the organization and touched so many areas that Nadella announced that he wanted to spread out those responsibilities moving forward, rather than concentrating all of that control in a single job function. No less than five people will be taking over Turner’s duties, according to the blog post.
Of the five, R Ray Wang, founder and and principal analyst at Constellation Research sees Judson Althoff, who will head the worldwide commercial business and Jean Phillipe Courtois, who will take over global sales and marketing operations as key and good signal ahead of next week’s Worldwide Partner Conference in Toronto.
“Kevin’s departure is a mutual win-win. He gets to become a CEO while Judson and Jean Phillipe move into the the sales leadership team. This means new life and vigor and Satya’s continued stamp on the new Microsoft,” Wang told TechCrunch.
Turner’s exit follows the departure of four fellow executives last June, which included former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, who was head of the company’s device group at the time of his departure; Mark Penn, EVP and Strategy Officer; Eric Rudder, who was in charge of advanced technology and Kirill Tatarinov head of business solutions.
There is always going to be turnover when a new leader comes onboard and those departures were due in large part to a reorganization Nadella undertook after taking over as CEO in 2014.
Turner was reportedly on the short list to replace Ballmer before Nadella was promoted, and there were rumors he had been difficult to work with. One source, who chose not to be identified said he was a “bulldog and an impediment.” The source went onto say it was a mutual decision and Nadella was ready for him to go, in spite of the platitudes in the blog post announcing his departure.

929,Ron Miller,"Pivotal, developers of the Cloud Foundry open source cloud development platform and Canonical, the company behind the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution, announced a partnership today where Ubuntu becomes the preferred operating system for Cloud Foundry.
In fact, the two companies have been BFFs since the earliest days of Cloud Foundry when it was an open source project developed at VMware. When VMware, EMC and GE spun out Pivotal as a separate company in 2013, Cloud Foundry was a big part of that and the relationship continued through today. Dustin Kirkland, head of Ubuntu product and strategy at Canonical, said he was surprised it took so long to formalize it, but today’s announcement marks a more official partnership.
It should help make life easier for Cloud Foundry customers running Ubuntu Linux in a number of important ways. First of all, it enables easy Ubuntu Linux upgrades and automated security patch management to give Cloud Foundry users quick access to any critical updates.
It also gives them access to Level 3 Ubuntu support. That means when there’s a problem that Cloud Foundry support personnel identify as an Ubuntu issue, the ticket gets transferred to Ubuntu where they handle it. In grey areas, which happen occasionally, Kirkland said they will work together to sort it out, but both companies have extensive experience performing support triage.
What’s more, the two companies have agreed to work together on a security certification framework, so that Ubuntu and Pivotal will be involved with the organizations writing the security standards manuals, which Ubuntu uses as a guide to build the most secure operating system possible. This is particularly important because the two companies can now help define and write these standards in a way that makes sense to them.
“We’ve signed up and are contributing to next iteration of these benchmarks, and we’re taking a more active role in developing these guides going forward.” Kirkland explained.
Since its inception, Pivotal has raised an astonishing $1.7 billion, according to Crunchbase. In its most recent round in May, Pivotal scored a $650 million Series C round led by Ford Motor Company on a valuation of $2.8 billion.",2016-07-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/24497179980_9a4f7b4dde_k.jpg?w=738,"linux,ubuntu,canonical,pivotal",Canonical-Pivotal partnership makes Ubuntu preferred Linux distro for Cloud Foundry
930,Lora Kolodny,"Remember when Target lost millions of customer credit card numbers to hackers who got in to their networks, of all things, through the company’s connected HVAC systems?
A startup called Veriflow Systems Inc. just raised $8.2 million in a Series A round of venture funding to prevent that kind of thing with technology it’s calling “mathematical network verification.”
The company’s systems basically give security and operations professionals a map of their networks, and a way to model any configuration or device changes before implementing them.
The models reveal where security holes may open up, or other problems may arise causing network outages and suboptimal performance as unintended consequences.
Menlo Ventures led the series A round in Veriflow joined by the company’s earlier backers New Enterprise Associates.
Earlier, Veriflow raised $2.9 million from NEA, the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Defense.
The company already has a product in the market, and clients including different government offices that it did not have permission to discuss.
Menlo Ventures’ Managing Director Matt Murphy said, “Networks are fairly opaque today and haven’t kept up with the kind of monitoring and visibility one gets into the compute, storage, and application layers of infrastructure.”
He expects the Oakland, Calif.-based startup to use the new funding to raise awareness of its technology, especially among IT operations and network security professionals, as well as for hiring and continued research and product development.
Murphy noted that one reason Menlo backed Veriflow is the track record of the founding team in computer science.
The company’s cofounders are award-winning computer scientists with PhDs from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and University of California at Berkeley: Principal Engineer Ahmed Khurshid, Chief Science Officer Matthew Caesar, and Chief Technology Officer Brighten Godfrey.
Veriflow’s CEO and president James Brear was formerly the CEO of Procera Networks, which he took public in 2011 and saw through a $240 million buyout in 2015.",2016-07-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/generic_code_hack_security.png?w=738,"matt-murphy,menlo-ventures,veriflow",Veriflow raised $8.2 million to help IT pros avoid network outages and breaches
931,Frederic Lardinois,"Google today announced the next version of Kubernetes, its open source orchestration service for deploying, scaling and managing software containers.
The focus of version 1.3 is on providing Kubernetes users with a more scalable and robust system for managing their containers in production. In addition, Kubernetes now also supports more emerging standards including CoreOS’s rkt, and those put forward by the Open Container Initiative (OCI) and Container Network Interface (CNI) initiatives.
“As our users scale their production deployments we’ve heard a clear desire to deploy services across cluster, zone and cloud boundaries,” Google product manager Aparna Sinha writes in today’s announcement. “We’ve also heard a desire to run more workloads in containers, including stateful services. In this release, we’ve worked hard to address these two problems, while making it easier for new developers and enterprises to use Kubernetes to manage distributed systems at scale.”
With this update the users will be able to set up services that span multiple clusters that can even be hosted across multiple clouds, too. Google notes that this enables new hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios and will allow for creating high-availability clusters that are more resistant to outages.
Kubernetes now also features a number of new features for developers who want to use containers to run stateful applications (think databases). The project now also features improved autoscaling support. “Customers no longer need to think about cluster size, and can allow the underlying cluster to respond to demand,” Google says.
Adding support for rkt as an alternative container runtime to Docker’s runtime doesn’t really come as a surprise. Google wants Kubernetes to be an extensible and open platform and different users have different needs. In practice that means following a path that’s not unlike Docker’s own “batteries included but swappable” model where Kubernetes may play favorites but still allows users to swap in their own preferred parts.
Kubernetes 1.3 now also rolling out to Google’s increasingly popular Container Engine service, which is basically a fully managed Kubernetes service on top of Google’s cloud platform. Google says Container Engine usage continues to double every 90 days and this new version of Kubernetes will now enable its users to run on twice as many nodes in a cluster as before (up to 2,000) and services can now span different availability zones.",2016-07-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/gettyimages-145057140.jpg?w=738,"containerization,rkt,coreos,kubernetes",Google launches a more scalable and robust Kubernetes
932,Ron Miller,"Microsoft announced its intention today to combine the Dynamics CRM and ERP products into an integrated platform on top of which it is hoping third parties will build applications.
It’s a complex announcement with many pieces, but Dynamics 365 shares more than its name with Office 365, it also has deep connections with the cloud office suite, as well as to Cortana voice intelligence and PowerBI data visualization — all of it built on a common platform and data model.
In order to break down this rather elaborate system into more manageable chunks, the company is offering discrete applications on top of the platform including specific apps for finance, field service, sales, operations, marketing, project service automation and customer service.
In addition, the company announced it’s launching the obligatory app store it’s calling Microsoft AppSource where developers can build and distribute their own apps, giving them a complete solution. The store will open with over 200 apps developed by early adopters.
What Microsoft offers here that even Salesforce can’t is the ability to marry process and productivity, taking advantage of its strengths (just as Salesforce’s recent moves to buy Demandware and SteelBrick play to theirs).
While the two approaches may seem similar on the surface — providing a broad platform play to build business-focused apps — there is a difference in Microsoft’s strategy, according to Rebecca Wettemann, vice president at Nucleus Research.
“The [advantage] of Microsoft’s approach is that it’s not just CRM data, but ERP data and the Office productivity suite unified, enabling users to access just the data and functions they need — be they from inventory, a customer record or e-mail — to get work done,” she explained.
This is distinctly different from Salesforce, which takes a customer-centered approach, says Brent Leary, a partner at CRM Essentials.
“At Salesforce Analyst Day earlier this year they were quite emphatic that they weren’t going to buy a traditional ERP app because there are way more things to focus on and go deeper in with customer engagement and customer experience,” Leary explained.
Perhaps Microsoft decided to go back to the drawing board and try a completely different approach because it’s just not doing all that well in the CRM market. Microsoft’s CRM marketshare was a dismal 4.3 percent, according to the most recent data from Gartner. That leaves them in fourth place looking up at Oracle and SAP with Salesforce at the top of the heap with almost 20 percent of the market.

That said, R Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst at Constellation Research says there is still room to maneuver in this market. “In the enterprise, Salesforce is winning, but in mid-to-large businesses, Dynamics is still king,” he said. Plus he says he’s seeing some clients shy away from Salesforce because of rising costs. Regardless, Microsoft still has a long way to go before it catches Oracle in third place with 7.8 percent.
It’s worth noting that Microsoft will continue to maintain separate on-prem versions of both the CRM and ERP products, which they try to spin as an advantage giving customers what they want while helping them get to the cloud a step at time as they are ready. In reality, it’s got to be a challenge for Microsoft to maintain two code bases.
It’s also important to remember that while competitors, Microsoft and Salesforce are also partners, making them classic “frenemies.” There were rumors last year that Microsoft was interesting in buying Salesforce, but that never materialized. Last Fall, Satya Nadella appeared on stage at Salesforce’s Dreamforce conference. It’s a complex relationship.
Today’s announcement is actually a preview of coming attractions. The new platform won’t be available until some time in the fall. Make no mistake though, this is a big move by Microsoft to take advantage of the pieces it has purposefully built over the last several years  — Office 365, Cortana and PowerBI — and to try to advance some of its enterprise applications in the never-ending battle for marketshare — even if it means shoving a frenemy.",2016-07-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/gettyimages-174229403.jpg?w=738,"cortana,crm,erp",Microsoft gives Salesforce a shove with new Dynamics 365 integrated cloud platform
933,Ron Miller,"Somewhere in a world full of advanced technology that we write about regularly here on TechCrunch, there exists an ancient realm where mainframe computers are still running programs written in COBOL.
This is a programming language, mind you, that was developed in the late 1950s, and used widely in the ’60s and ’70s and even into the ’80s, but it’s never really gone away. You might think it would have been mostly eradicated from modern business by now, but you would be wrong.
As we march along, however, the pool of people who actually know how to maintain these COBOL programs grows ever smaller by the year, and companies looking to move the data (and even the archaic programs) to a more modern platform could be stuck without personnel to help guide them through the transition.
That’s clearly a problem and LzLabs, a Swiss startup, saw a huge opportunity here. “The skill shortage in terms of maintaining the code that runs on the legacy mainframes has become acute. It’s become a huge problem finding the people to keep these going,” LzLabs CEO Mark Cresswell told TechCrunch.
To help solve that problem, Lz has come up with a remarkable solution called Gotthard that helps these companies tease out the various bits of data, executables, configuration files and so forth from the hornet’s nest of code written all those years ago. It then places these various pieces in a container and moves them lock, stock and barrel to a cloud platform running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).
It’s not a coincidence that today’s announcement comes after another one last winter at the CeBIT Technology Fair in Germany, where the company launched what it calls the first software defined mainframe and announced partnerships with Red Hat and Microsoft (who themselves announced a partnership around the same time to bring RHEL to Azure).
The company is not claiming their tools will allow some sort of instant solution. It’s going to be a long-haul type of job. They hope to partner with third-party systems integrators who can work with their customers to do the grunt work required to prepare the content for transfer.
Today’s announcement is about building on that original announcement and providing tools for these companies running legacy mainframe applications to ease that transition to the extent possible. It’s still likely to be long and painful process regardless, but at least there are some tools now to help ease that journey.",2016-07-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/gettyimages-563962535.jpg?w=738,"migration,mainframes",LzLabs launches product to move mainframe COBOL code to Linux cloud
934,Ron Miller,"HourlyNerd, a Boston-based startup, aspires to be more than an on-demand staffing service for skilled employees. It wants to be a full-service platform for large companies to change the way they think about employees.
“If you think about a company today, it’s structured in the same way as 100 years ago,” says company co-CEO and co-founder Rob Biederman. HourlyNerd sees a future where companies make increasing use of on-demand workers.
That’s partly because it meets the needs of the company, who might not require a full time employee to complete a project, and partly for the workers, who might prefer the flexibility that project work brings.
To that end, HourlyNerd is in the process of updating the platform to include analytics and other services to help customers not only hire people on-demand, but manage their time, their work product and the customer staffing requirements over time.
At its heart today, HourlyNerd can provide customers with programming and other skilled staff for a short-term need without having to recruit and hire the talent themselves.
The idea, especially with the transition to enterprise clients, appears to be gaining some traction as the company announced a $22 million Series C round today led by General Catalyst Partners with participation from Highland Capital Partners, GE Ventures, Mark Cuban, Greylock Partners and Bob Doris of Accanto Partners.
This represents a hefty round for the firm, which prior to this had raised around $12 million in total. The investors seemed intrigued by the idea of taking the on-demand employee market to another level and they saw enough market potential here with a platform play, that it warranted a significant increase in investment to carry out the new vision.
It’s an idea that has merit. At the On-demand Economy conference at MIT last March, there was a lot of discussion about the changing way people will work in the future, and the impact this was having on infrastructure we’ve set up around work over the last 100 years. Speakers describe a changing economy in terms that sounded very much like HourlyNerd’s vision — where skilled workers move from project to project, rather than working for one company for a period of years.
That requires a whole new way of interacting with these employees including how to manage them, measure performance and incentivize these people.
The company, which currently has 65 employees, claims around 10 percent of the Fortune 500 as customers, so they are beginning to attract the very type of clients they hope to serve more broadly in the future. These include Pfizer and GE, which helped finance the round through its GE Ventures.",2016-07-05,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/gettyimages-536986013.jpg?w=738,"series-c,on-demand-economy",On-demand staffing startup HourlyNerd lands $22 million Series C
935,Devin Coldewey,"One of the perils of text-based communication is the lack of cues that clearly signal irony being employed — no doubt we’ve all had our own mishaps behind this particular issue. Researchers from Portugal have had enough, though, and built a neural network that tries to determine whether you or your virtual interlocutor is being sarcastic.
It’s not just to avoid awkward missteps in our everyday conversations online, though: computationally determining the tone and meaning of a given message is important for many things.
You can’t do accurate sentiment analysis, for instance, if you don’t know when someone is kidding around when they say they love or hate something. And knowing the difference between an affirmative “great!” and a sarcastically disappointed one is important for natural language processing.

“Lexical cues alone are insufficient to discern ironic intent,” reads the introduction of the paper, written by Silvio Amir at the University of Lisbon. “Appreciating the context of utterances is critical for this, even for humans.”
To learn that context, the paper describes a method by which the neural network finds the user’s “embeddings” — i.e. contextual cues like the content of previous tweets, related interests and accounts, and so on. It uses these various factors to plot the user with others, and (ideally) finds that they form relatively well-defined groups.
For instance, these little clouds of users are the result of looking at what politicians a set of users followed on Twitter.

If the sentiment of the tweet seems to disagree with the bulk of what is expressed by similar users, there’s a good chance sarcasm is being employed.
Combined with textual factors that give a hint of irony, this approach proved more capable than other models out there — barely. It was right about 87 percent of the time versus 85 in the other system. However, the neural network setup required far less manual configuration and monitoring, and could be more easily extended for deployment on different social networks.
We’re still a little short of a universal sarcasm indicator, but we’ll get there. Amir’s paper is due to be presented at CoNLL, a natural language learning conference taking place next month.",2016-08-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/shutterstock_94007068.jpg?w=738,"natural-language-processing,neural-networks,ai,sarcasm",This neural network tries to tell if you’re being sarcastic online
936,Josh Constine,"Facebook built its own version of Snapchat Stories, called Quick Updates, but will not release it. Though Instagram Stories launched this week, Facebook isn’t going to follow suit.
Quick Updates created a special place to share within the Facebook app but outside of the News Feed. Accessible from a button at the top of the feed, Quick Updates would have let people share 24-hour disappearing photos and videos with overlaid text. These posts wouldn’t appear in the feed or in people’s profiles.
Quick Updates featured its own design style, opposed to Instagram Stories which much more closely copies Snapchat Stories. When asked about cloning Snapchat, Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom even said “They deserve all the credit.”

TechCrunch received screenshots of a test of Quick Updates two weeks ago, but the test quickly disappeared after we published about it. Facebook told me at the time that “Quick Updates” was an experiment shown to some people, and that Facebook would not move forward with it.
But the release of Instagram Stories begged the question of whether Facebook won’t modify the feature or release something similar, perhaps called “Facebook Stories.”
I asked Facebook, and a spokesperson told me “Quick updates was something we were going to test. It’s an idea we’re not pursuing anymore.” When pressed on the issue, the Facebook spokesperson provided this official statement:
So at least hardcore social media users won’t have to post non-stop daily updates to three networks, just two.
That said, on Facebook’s successful earnings call last week, Mark Zuckerberg vowed that “We see a world that is video first, with video at the heart of all of our apps and services.”
Yet Facebook hasn’t significantly updated its video uploader in nearly three years, despite me calling for them to modernize since 2013. You still can’t overlay filters, text, drawings or stickers on videos. You can’t combine multiple clips into a single video, add soundtracks, create transitions or use features found in other apps like Snapchat, YouTube, Vine and even Instagram.
Facebook did recently acquire MSQRD, an app for applying animated selfie filters similar to Snapchat’s lenses. But there’s been no official integration of MSQRD into Facebook or Instagram Stories, though Instagram says that’s coming.
Facebook’s video sharing tool is embarrassingly archaic and is sorely due for an upgrade. Instagram Stories just makes that even more clear.",2016-08-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/facebook-stories-snapchat-instagram.png?w=738,instagram-stories,"Facebook built, but won’t launch, a “Facebook Stories” Snapchat clone"
937,Sarah Perez,"Disney today is wading into the mobile messaging market with a new chat application called Disney Mix, aimed at kids, tweens and families. While the app will compete to some extent with popular messaging clients like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Snapchat and others, the goal with Disney Mix is to provide a safer alternative that’s built with the needs of kids in mind. That means the app isn’t just about chatting — it’s also about playing games, making memes, sharing stickers and more, says Disney.
The company notes that it already has over a decade of experience when it comes to building online communities for children, including things like Club Penguin, MarvelKids and other virtual worlds.
To create Disney Mix, it used the learnings from Club Penguin as a starting point, then built out new tools, moderation capabilities and educational resources that are specific to Disney Mix.
Of course, given its target demographic, Disney Mix adheres to the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which restricts how companies operating services directed to children are allowed to collect and use personal information.

When users sign up for the app, they agree to a series of community rules, including “stay safe,” respect others” and “keep it clean.” The first refers to the fact that you don’t give out personal information to people you don’t know, while the others speak to the type of content that can be shared. That is, there’s to be no bullying and no foul language.
There are moderation capabilities in the app as well, that will see members either temporarily and permanently banned from Disney Mix for breaking any of the rules, says Disney.
This is handled by a moderation team that can also be summoned at any time by clicking the “Whistle” icon in the top of the chat thread. This reports the conversation to the mod team to handle. Plus, Disney Mix users can remove people from their friends list by swiping left on their name.
The company is also encouraging parents to sit down with kids to discuss the rules of the app, before signing up their under 13-year-old kids to participate.
While the app is rated as “4+” on the App Store, the concept will likely appeal the most to slightly older kids, up to pre-teens.
In Disney Mix, friends can chat with each other, which includes sending stickers of favorite Disney characters, like Flash from Zootopia, Hank from Finding Dory and Jenny from Adventures in Babysitting, for example. Additional content in the app comes from Frozen, Monsters University, Toy Story, K.C. Undercover, Descendants and other Disney franchises.
Beyond chatting with friends and family, kids can also add Disney accounts to their friends list, like Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Movies. These accounts will then message them with new photos and videos periodically, along with other news.
Perhaps the biggest differentiator between Disney Mix and a straightforward messaging client is that it has a variety of interactive games built-in, like Spikes, Elsa’s Winter Waltz and Cards of Doom. Friends can play these games with each other inside their chat screen.
When getting started, users set up a personalized avatar that they customize by selecting the hair style, facial features, accessories and more. It’s not all that different from Nintendo’s Miitomo, except for the fact that their avatar is just the face, not a whole body.
Disney says that an upcoming release of the app will introduce support for more features, including photo and video sharing — again, with parental involvement kept in mind, the company claims.
Disney Mix is a free download on iOS and Android.

938,Josh Constine,"Facebook Pages and websites that frequently withhold, exaggerate or distort information in their link headlines will disappear from News Feed thanks to a new anti-clickbait algorithm that’s now rolling out.
Facebook manually classified tens of thousands of headlines with a clickbaitiness score to train the new algorithm. Now it can detect headlines like “When She Looked Under Her Couch And Saw THIS… I Was SHOCKED!”; “He Put Garlic In His Shoes And What Happens Next Is Hard To Believe”; or “The Dog Barked At The Deliveryman And His Reaction Was Priceless.”
Rather than just assigning a binary “Yes, clickbait” or “not clickbait,” each story gets a score about how egregious it is. The algorithm primarily looks for phrases often used in clickbait headlines but not in legitimate headlines, similar to email spam filters.
The higher the clickbait likelihood, the more the algorithm punishes the entire Page that shared them or site they link to by making all their posts or referral links less visible. “If you post 50 times a day and post one piece a clickbait, this shouldn’t affect you. If you’re a spammer and post clickbait all day, this should affect you a lot,” Facebook’s VP of Product Management on News Feed, Adam Mosseri, tells me.
Luckily, if a publisher reforms its ways and “they stop posting clickbait, their referral traffic will bounce back,” Mosseri explains. And since the algorithm identifies offenders on both the web domain level and the Facebook Page level, spammers can’t build a Page and then just launch new websites with different URLs to elude punishment.
Clickbait is one of the most complained about parts of the News Feed. Some people even file bug reports blaming the News Feed ranking algorithm. The change aligns with Facebook’s recently announced News Feed Values. “Authentic Communication” is one of the five values, along with “Friends And Family Come First,” which led to last month’s feed change to de-emphasize news publishers.
Facebook is even open to sharing its insights about how to fight clickbait with other social networks or tech products. “I have no problem walking any company through what we did and how we did it so they can borrow it,” Mosseri tells me.
However, Facebook won’t be publicly publishing the multi-page document of guidelines for defining clickbait because “a big part of this is actually spam, and if you expose exactly what we’re doing and how we’re doing it, they reverse in engineer it and figure out how to get around it.”
In a possible slight to Gizmodo, which accused Facebook of suppressing conservative trending topics based on information from anonymous sources, one of Facebook’s fake examples of clickbait comes from a site called “Gizmotecho.com”

Facebook already made an anti-clickbait algorithm change in 2014, focusing on user behavior. It looked for links that people Liked then clicked, but then immediately bounced back to Facebook and Unliked because the website they arrived at didn’t meet the expectations set by the headline.
In February Facebook started looking more closely at how little time people lingered on clickbait sites, and identified links with lots of clicks but very few subsequent Likes. Today’s change focuses on the source of the problem rather than tracking the symptoms.
To help publishers stay on the good side of the enforcement algorithm, Facebook has posted some tips to avoid relying on clickbait. Facebook advises that publishers avoid omission of important information to trick readers into clicking, like “You’ll Never Believe Who Tripped and Fell on the Red Carpet…” Facebook instead suggests calls to action and text prompts. Facebook also recommends avoiding exaggeration like “This Pen Never Ever Runs Out of Ink! Get It While It Lasts!”
News publishers are naturally nervous about any News Feed change. They depend on Facebook for referral traffic, and are on guard since Facebook said it would prioritize friends and family over them last month.
If all these anti-clickbait efforts work, it could boost referral traffic for legitimate publishers, as users may become more confident that links they see are worth a click.

939,Matthew Lynley,"Video has generally been available — and is often shared — on Pinterest, but it hasn’t quite received the same treatment that the company’s traditional content has seen.
Over the next few months, however, that will be changing. Pinterest is starting to test ways to get video running directly on its services, including building a native video player. And beyond that, it’s going to start implementing its visual search tools on those videos, giving the company more data on how to deliver it to users at the right moments.
It’s a big move for Pinterest. A huge swath of online activity consists of mobile video, and that’s only going to get bigger over time. And there are a lot of destinations where creators can share videos, like Facebook and YouTube. Pinterest has generally been interested in video, but hasn’t taken a huge deep dive on it just yet. We’ve seen flashes of their interest, in the likes of products like cinematic pins, but this is going to be a big move going forward.
“Pinterest is the place where people come to discover the things that inspire them or what they want to do in the real world,” Davis said. “From parenting to home decor, it’s a place where you find content you want to interact with in the real world. Whether that’s buying something, or picking up new skills, that’s the central value proposition of Pinterest. Video is just a better way of explaining a lot of things. There’s a reason cooking shows are really popular, it’s more entertaining than just reading an article.”
One of Pinterest’s greatest strengths is its discovery tools. Users come into Pinterest coming from all different points of looking to discover products, whether that’s casual browsing, searching, or in the end collecting pins or going directly in to buy products. By taking the same approach to video, Pinterest will basically unlock that intent in a different online behavior that a lot of other platforms have actively tapped into. But it can use its data in different ways than, say, Facebook, in order to move users closer and closer to potentially buying products.
Giving creators a native video player on Pinterest also helps. Instead of having to send users off the site or deal with tricky embed problems, creators can simply post their content directly to Pinterest and automatically get indexed by these new visual search tools. That can help them continue to build their audience — which generally spans multiple platforms already — with higher-quality, platform-specific experiences.

“For instance, if you’re watching a cooking video and you just run visual algorithms on a couple frames, what you’ll get back is carrots, oven, etc,” he said. “That doesn’t give you an underlying understanding of it’s being a cooking video. But if you stick machine learning on it you can get to those understandings if you have a good tagged set. We think we can create those sets, train our models, understand more holistically what things are about.”
There are obvious commerce implications for something like this, too. In one universe, you might imagine a video demonstrating knife skills, and the ability to buy the knives in question in the video. Pinterest already has a lot of commerce tools in place — and continues to expand them in new ways over time, like implementing visual search into photos users can take with their phones. All this not only gives Pinterest an ability to sell products, it convinces businesses to take Pinterest seriously as a place to get their products in front of users.
The upgrades to visual search on video are getting rolled out over the next few months, as well as the native video player, Davis said.",2016-08-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/visual-search-on-pinterest.jpg?w=738,"video,pinterest",Pinterest starts expanding its visual search tools to video

Here’s how it works:
After downloading the app and connecting with friends on the Unmute platform, anyone can start a call and up to 50 people can join. During the call, up to six people can speak at once, which was a deliberate choice by the company to make sure these calls don’t get too disorganized.
Another decision by the company was to limit calls to 18 minutes, which is the same amount of time that Ted talks last. The team says this is the ideal time to participate in (or just listen to) a conversation.

So what are these users talking about?
Co-founder Jason Yeh, who left Greycroft Venture to join the Unmute team, says that the company has seen a ton of usage from teenagers, especially girls, who use the platform to chat with their friends.
But celebrities and influencers could also play a big role in the company, offering their fans a chance to speak to them directly and candidly without having to get done up and put on makeup like they’d have to for a Periscope live stream.
With the launch of Unmute 2.0, the VoIP platform is introducing four hotlines where people can join the call to chat with strangers. These hotlines don’t have specific topics or categories, as Unmute believes that conversations should be organic and wander from topic to topic, as they do in the real world.
Unmute has raised $2.2 million in seed funding.

941,Natasha Lomas,"There are signs that a growing number of Brits are feeling overwhelmed by the never-ending demands of digital technology, with many web users attempting to reset the balance between their online and offline lives by taking a temporary break from connected devices.
The finding comes from U.K. telecoms watchdog Ofcom’s 13th annual Communications Market report, which offers a yearly deep-dive into the domestic digital and media consumption landscape. (You can read the full report here.)
Ofcom found that one in three UK internet users (or some 15 million people) have, in 2016, deemed there’s too much tech in their life — going on to take a so-called ‘digital detox’ to try to regain control over their devices.
A quarter of these reported spending up to a day internet free; a fifth took a week off; and 5 percent somehow managed to be web-free for up to a month.

One in 10 had apparently even taken a self-enforced break from their screens in the past week alone. The figures were extrapolated from a study of 2,025 U.K. adults and 500 teenagers, conducted by Ofcom.
The watchdog also found that many internet users relished their self-enforced breaks, with a third (33 percent) reporting they felt more productive; and 27 percent describing it as “liberating,” while a quarter said they “enjoyed life more.” Not exactly a great verdict for tech.
On the negative side, 16 percent of detoxers reported experiencing FOMO during their break, 15 percent described themselves as feeling “lost” and 14 percent as “cut-off.”
The report also unearths some distinctly addict-style behavior among U.K. tech (over)users, with almost half (49 percent) reporting time spent online eating into hours originally intended for other tasks. More than a third (37 percent) said the same was true of their use of social media.
Activities being neglected because Brits are overusing the internet include housework (reported by 48 percent); sleep and rest (47 percent); and spending time with friends and family (31 percent). So technology is making Brits more messy, tired and antisocial.
One in five (22 percent) internet users also admitted to being late for a meeting with friends or family because they’d been sucked into stuff online, while 13 percent said they’d been made late for work because of their use of tech.

Tech’s attention-sucking ways appear even more pronounced for U.K. teens, with a quarter (26 percent) reportedly being late for school as a result of web use, and the majority (60 percent) of teenagers neglecting school work to spend time online.
Unsurprisingly, Ofcom also found many U.K. parents are limiting children’s time online, with 61 percent of teens who use a connected device reporting being digitally grounded, having their device taken away or its usage restricted. Although you can imagine teenagers fuming about hypocritical parents as a result.
For adult Internet users in the U.K., Ofcom found they’re spending an average of one day per week (25 hours) online, with 42 percent reporting they go online or check apps more than 10 times a day, and a truly addicted one in 10 (11 percent) accessing the internet more than 50 times daily.
While Brit web users are clearly very wedded to the internet, they are at least not in denial about their addiction: a majority (59 percent) of Internet users describe themselves as “hooked” on their connected device. And a third (34 percent) admitted they find it difficult to disconnect.
The Ofcom report also charts a particular rise in the use of instant messaging in the UK, which is likely to be contributing to the feeling of being overwhelmed by time-sapping tech, given the ceaseless demands of open-ended real-time messaging chats which — unlike other comms technologies — don’t have clear or natural cut-off points.
Ofcom found that the proportion of U.K. adults using services such as Facebook Messenger and the Facebook-owned WhatsApp messaging app at least once per week rose from under a third (28 per cent) back in 2014 to approaching a majority (43 per cent) in 2016 — which it flags as the biggest increase across all comms and media activities it charts in the report.
It notes that instant messaging is also considered the single most important means of communication among 16- to 24-year-olds, with 36 percent citing it as their top comms medium.
Also on an uptick in the U.K.: photo or video messaging services, such as Snapchat, which are now used by a fifth (21 percent) of U.K. adults on a weekly basis, up from 14 percent in 2014.
Email and texting (SMS) remain the most common methods of text-based communication, at 70 per cent and 63 percent respectively in a given week, although usage of both has declined on 2014 levels (seven percentage points and eight percentage points, respectively).
Other findings from the report include:

942,Sarah Perez,"Twitter today is debuting a new advertising format that will encourage its users to tweet more often, while talking about an advertiser’s brand. With the new ads, businesses and brands will now be able to post a call-to-action that offers some sort of exclusive content that can only be unlocked with a tweet — like the ability to preview the trailer from a new film, gain access to an exclusive Q&A, get a recipe from a favorite food company and more.
The feature is an extension of Twitter’s previously launched “Conversational Ads,” which give advertisers the ability to post images and videos along with call-to-action buttons that include customizable hashtags.
The difference with these new “Instant Unlock Cards,” as they’re called, is that users have to tweet in order to view the content being promoted. That is, the content is only unlocked after the tweet is posted.
This is something that could spur Twitter’s user base to interact with the service more often. But more importantly, it could potentially even push people to sign up for a Twitter account, if they were interested in viewing the content from the brand in question.
Boosting user growth is something Twitter desperately needs these days, as its monthly active users grew just under 1 percent in the last quarter, to 313 million. The company has not figured out the secret sauce when it comes to convincing users as to why they need to set up a Twitter account for themselves — after all, Twitter’s content of interest can be viewed by logged-out users, as well, while the most newsworthy tweets eventually make their way into articles that are later disseminated to other social networks, like Facebook, or are shared by news broadcasters on air.
In addition to the possibility of giving users a reason to tweet, the new ad also capitalizes on the type of activity brands try to encourage anyway — that is, to have people tweeting and sharing their message with their friends and Twitter’s wider network.

These promoted tweets featuring the Instant Unlock Cards will appear in users’ timelines and offer explicit instructions on how to view the exclusive content they’re offering. But instead of requiring users to write out their own tweets, there will be a button users can click that will pre-populate the tweet with customized text, like the brand’s custom hashtag.
During its beta trials, Twitter reported that brands saw an average 34 percent earned media rate, it says. That means for every 100 paid impressions, the advertiser saw 34 views. Brands that had early access to Twitter’s new features included Coca-Cola, AMC, Marvel and Axe Body Spray.
AMC used the ad to promote the world premiere of its “The Walking Dead” trailer, which was the best use of the format. Coca-Cola and Marvel simply encouraged Twitter users to pick between two options and then tweet their support accordingly.

Along with Instant Unlock Cards, Twitter says it’s also rolling out more advanced analytics for brands tracking their conversational ad units, which will help them track engagement metrics and earned media associated with their campaigns.",2016-08-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/screenshot_742.png?w=738,ads,Twitter’s newest ads are designed to get users to tweet
943,Josh Constine,"This is where Facebook will prototype its solar drones, Internet-beaming lasers, VR headsets, and next-gen servers.
The problem with moving faster than most companies is that Facebook was plagued by delays whenever it had to outsource prototyping and testing of its gadgets and gizmos. With so much hardware on its 10-year roadmap, and quarter after quarter of profits stacking up, it made sense to build a dedicated laboratory within its Menlo Park headquarters.
Check out what we saw on our tour: “40 photos from Facebook’s ‘Area 404’ mad science laboratory”
 
So yesterday, Facebook gave a group of journalists the first look inside Area 404.
Packed with giant, expensive, dangerous machines like a computer-controlled 9-axis drill, Area 404 houses one of the few rooms at Facebook Mark Zuckerberg isn’t allowed in. It’s too unsafe despite all the precautions, certifications, and training Facebook offers its hardware engineers.

Luckily Facebook rigorously adheres to a 5S safety system — sort, set in order, shine, standardize and sustain. Every single tool is laid in a labeled square of tape.  Spencer Burns, one of the lab’s CNC Model Maker, explains that Facebook can’t move fast if it can’t find its tools.

Jay Parikh, Facebook’s Head of Engineering and Infrastructure, tells me the 22,000 square foot space is named Area 404 after the “Not Found” error code. Facebook engineers kept needing to prototype new hardware devices, but the resources necessary were unfortunately “not found” at Facebook.

After enough requests, Facebook burrowed out a bunch of offices in Building 17 of its headquarters, drilled giant support columns down to the bedrock to support the heavy machinery, and turned the space into a gleaming white, futuristic hack center.

It’s a massive upgrade from where Facebook’s tinkering in the physical world started. “Our first hardware lab was a big as a desk in the old mail room” laughs Parikh. His favorite piece of the new lab? An electron microscope with 10,000X magnification for inspecting teeny, tiny failures in hardware. Construction began 9 months ago under the supervision of Facebook’s Mechanical And Power Manager Mikal Greaves, and now the first teams are moving in.
Parikh explains that there are two main objectives for Area 404:
Both will cut down the time it takes Facebook to get from device conception to working prototype it can then mass produce. The Internet.org Connectivity team that tests apps under weak connections, the Oculus VR squad, Facebook’s mysterious new Building 8 pioneer tech division, and its Infrastructure teams that build servers and data center can now bounce ideas off each other in a shared home. The lab has 50 work benches to accommodate them all.

Inside the lab we saw everything from 3D design software modeling stations to computer-controlled lathes and mills for forging metal into prototypes to an MRI machine for looking inside a device for errors. Half of the lab is dedicated to electrical engineering experimentation, while half is for prototyping workshops for shaping, cutting, and bending metal as well as manipulating wood, stone, or glass if necessary.

What will be built here? Data infrastructure like Facebook’s open rack network switch Wedge, its Open Vault storage solution, and the sensors for its Telecom Infra Project’s OpenCellular platform. Connectivity Lab inventions like the Terragraph wifi nodes and Project ARIES antenna, as well as parts for the Aquila solar-powered drone that just had its first successful test flight. Plus Oculus will prototype future version of the Rift headset and the Surround 360 camera.
Area 404 doesn’t do everything. There’s no welding tools here, and it won’t be processing its own circuit boards. When devices are ready for scaled production, the prototypes built at Area 404 will be sent elsewhere to be copied. At that point, there shouldn’t be any extra back-and-forth iterations necessary. All the kinks will have been worked out at HQ.
Hardware isn’t a new endeavor for Facebook. It has an Oculus hub in Seattle and an airplane hangar in the UK for its Aquila drone. But with Area 404, it can bring its creations in the physical world up to the same pace of creation and iteration that’s driven Facebook’s success in the software world.

944,Sarah Perez,"Not to be outdone by Twitter – who, yesterday introduced followable Moments and other means of tuning into Olympics news via its network – Facebook is rolling out a number of ways for its users to show support for their favorite teams plus track the Olympics news they care about in a dedicated section of the News Feed, the company announced this week.
Naturally, the social network is again bringing back Profile Frames for the Olympics. First introduced last year, this feature lets you place a custom frame around your Profile picture on Facebook. The new Olympics frames are branded with the Rio 2016 logo while also allowing you to show your support for your country or favorite teams. These will arrive by the end of the week.

Meanwhile, the recent Facebook acquisition MSQRD, a photo and video filter app, is rolling out country flag masks which you can overlay on your photos or videos starting today. The app earlier this summer also expanded to support live broadcasting to Facebook, so you can show your friends and family what you look like before and after you don your Olympics mask, if you choose.

The most interesting addition to the collection of Olympics-related content on Facebook, however, is the debut of a personalized section in your News Feed. From August 1st through August 5th, Facebook will greet users with an Olympics illustration and message at the top of their News Feed. (e.g. “Excited for the Games?,” followed by a prompt to explore.)
You may have already seen this greeting and ignored it, thinking it was just another of Facebook’s prods to get you to share.
But instead, if you click through, you’ll be taken to a page that offers a “dynamic” mix of Olympics content, including Olympics-themed search results and conversations, as well as Events, Live Videos from Rio, and more which are personalized to you.
Facebook will also send out a similar greeting on August 21st for the Closing Ceremony, it says.
Unfortunately, if you dismiss or ignore this greeting and it disappears, there’s not an obvious way to find your way over to this Olympics page again. In fact, that’s one of the drawbacks of Facebook, when it comes to tracking sports content on its site today.
This is not the first time the company has invested in making discussing live sports more of a destination, rather than an activity. Earlier this year, it rolled out “Sports Stadium,” a section inside the social network where fans can enjoy play-by-play coverage of sports matches, view comments from friends, experts, and analysts, and check out other game and play information. But this page is similarly difficult to find, if Facebook doesn’t place it in front of you in some sort of obvious way.
Because of these navigational challenges, Twitter may actually be easier to use when it comes to tracking live commentary around the games, catching up on the medal counts, or watching a few highlights. Twitter has also been working to align itself with the broader audience of sports fans in recent months thanks to deals with the NFL, MLB, NHL, NBA, and more.",2016-08-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/image005.png?w=738,olympics,"Facebook rolls out a personalized Olympics section in the News Feed, plus Olympic filters and frames"
945,Darrell Etherington,"The NFL and Snapchat heart each other, and will continue to heart each other for multiple years to come: The two announced an extension to their “strategic partnership” today, which includes Snapchat’s first official sports league Discover channel, an NFL-programmed collection of piping hot football fan service content.
The NFL is also doubling down on its existing commitment to create Live Stories, promising one produced for every single NFL official season game, including the Super bowl, and for special events like the NFL Draft. Live Stories from the NFL blend behind-the-scenes content from insiders, as well as fan-created Snaps added via location-based contributions.
Also in store for NFL fans are custom-created Snapchat Geofilters for each of the NFL’s 32 teams. These will appear for fans whenever they’re in proximity of NFL stadiums, as well as practice facilities and “select venues” — maybe your local sports pub, provided they’re committed enough to the home team?
Basically, the NFL wants fans who also have Snapchat to never have to experience an NFL-less day on the social network, and they’re covering their bases (covering the field with zone defense? Sports metaphors are very challenging for me) with custom features in every conceivable part of the service.
Snapchat’s redesigned Discover section was intended to bring more brands on board, and this NFL partnership gives them a marquee addition in a new area. It also provides another way for Snapchat to skew older and more mainstream, while the NFL might be able to reach a new generation of audience via the service. For Snapchat, at least, this is likely a revenue touchdown (nailed that “red zone” sports metaphor — and there’s a bonus one for you, too).",2016-08-02,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/3e69a1a4df5c4be4b5046c9352fc57d6.jpg?w=738,"nfl,national-football-league",The NFL is the first sports league on Snapchat Discover
946,John Mannes,"Everyone loves stickers. Snapchat must be on to us because the company just launched Geostickers, a new feature that lets users send city-specific stickers in snaps and messages.
There are 15 stickers available in San Francisco as of now, and we expect more to come. The adorable caricatures delightfully mock tech culture, jab at rising rents and highlight local landmarks. In addition to San Francisco, the feature is also launching in Los Angeles, New York City, Washington, DC, Honolulu, London, Sydney, São Paulo, Paris and Riyadh.
The launch almost seems like an effort to recapture the news cycle from Instagram which launched “Stories,” a Snapchat alternative, earlier this morning. Notably, Stories lacks location filters, stickers and speed effects.
Geo-specific features have been quite a draw for people and businesses. Geofilters, which let users overlay location-specific art onto their snaps, have developed a large community dedicated to producing custom filters. Businesses can even produce Geofilters to advertise for events that are geofenced and enabled for a pre-set time.
Geostickers builds on this community and provides another platform for customizable expression. The addition comes on the heels of Bitmoji integration with Snapchat last month. The app lets people create personalized self-reflective emoji that can be used as stickers in snaps.",2016-08-02,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/13844243_10208233831422423_1616684412_o.jpg?w=738,"photo-sharing,sticker",Snapchat lets the people have Geostickers
947,Josh Constine,"People only post the highlights of their life on Instagram, so today the app adds its own version of “Stories” to poach goofy, off-the-cuff, everyday content from Snapchat. It works exactly like Snapchat Stories, allowing you to post 24-hour ephemeral photo and video slideshows that disappear. But because Instagram Stories appear at the top of the old feed, your followers will inevitably see them without you needing to build a new audience in a different app.
Instagram Stories is rolling out globally for iOS and Android over the next few weeks.
You could call it Snapchat for adults, a way for brands to post more without overwhelming people’s feeds, an alternative to Instagram’s Like-driven success theater or a blatant ripoff.
Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom wouldn’t disagree with you. When confronted about Instagram Stories being a clone of Snapchat Stories, he surprisingly admitted “They deserve all the credit,” but insisted “This isn’t about who invented something. This is about a format, and how you take it to a network and put your own spin on it.” Read my full interview with Kevin Systrom here.
With 500 million monthly active users, 300 million daily actives and now 250 million users on its Direct messaging feature, Instagram is enormous expansion for what Snapchat pioneered.
Facebook wants to own more unique, must-see original sharing that was reportedly down 15 percent year over year as of early 2016. But boosting sharing frequency has been hard for Instagram because people only post their most polished selfies, sunsets and meals.
Systrom admits he hadn’t shared to Instagram at all during the six days before we met because none of the moments seemed special enough. “Instagram is a curated feed, but you only get to see the highlights,” Systrom laments. Instagram’s sweat and blemish-hiding filters encouraged that social norm. And while Instagram recently started sorting its feed, people still worry that posting multiple times in a row will seem like they’re spamming their friends, so they hold back.

Stories creates a place for content that’s not “good enough” for the Instagram feed, or at least is too silly to fit in amongst the art. Because everything disappears, you don’t have to be ashamed of that awkward face or stupid joke forever the way things posted to your real Instagram profile reflect on you forever.
Systrom explains that “It basically solves a problem for all these people who want to take a ton of photos of an event or something in their lives, but want to manage what their profile looks like and not bomb feed, obviously, as that’s one of the no-nos on Instagram.”
Facebook has tried multiple times to copy Snapchat with standalone apps like Poke, Slingshot and Instagram Bolt. No one wanted another app, and they all failed and were pulled from the stores.
But Instagram may have found a breakthrough for solving this problem. Instead of burying a Snapchat competitor in another app people don’t need, it’s put it front and center of one they use all the time. And instead of trying to be special with weird mechanics like Slingshot’s reply-to-reveal content, it’s cloned Snapchat Stories down to the pixel because it’s already proven to work.
For a quick guide to how Instagram Stories works, check out our animated instruction manual.
It’s easiest to think of Instagram Stories in terms of what’s the same and what’s different from Snapchat Stories.

Eventually, Instagram Stories could be a goldmine, though Systrom says the company won’t focus on monetization until users love it. “I think that businesses and interest accounts, celebrities, etcetera, especially businesses, will find a tremendous use case,” he tells me. “They post three times and they think to themselves ‘Aww, should we really be posting that fourth photo?’ And this just opens the floodgates on events.”
Eventually Instagram could sell ads that point users to a brand’s Story, like a clothing label with a Story from their fashion show, a politician from their rally or a brand doing a sponsored content tie-in with a social media star. Instead of directing people to their sluggish profile, they can point them to a dynamic, urgent story.
At their core, the use cases of Instagram Stories and Snapchat Stories are identical: Shoot, decorate and frequently share little clips from your life. Instagram lacks some of Snapchat’s advanced features, but it’s built where many people, especially adults, already have a social graph built.
It’s that placement of Stories atop the Instagram, a simple design choice, that could make Instagram a hit. People love to vie for attention. If you give them a new window to show off through that’s smack dab at the front of an app their friends use, vanity will kick in and people will fill that space with their face and creations.
When Instagram launched six years ago, it was a new network open to experimentation in front of friends. People were trying to learn how to make art from camera phones. But over time, Instagram evolved into a game where everyone seeks to win the most Likes and validation. And so they only share the most exciting, pretty parts of the their life, and everything else is swept under the rug.
Eventually Instagram became the core permanent profile of the mobile generation, and everything you posted had to be good enough for you to be judged by forever. Teens created fake Instagram profiles called “Finstagrams” only their closest friends could see just so they could post whatever they wanted without grubbing for internet points.
Now Instagram is offering a different way to share with no Likes, no public comments and a lot less pressure.
The bright-colored text and sloppy drawing may feel a bit out of place on Instagram at first, which is why Instagram was smart not to simply add the Stories creation tool to the main feed’s default uploader.

“We’re north of 500 million people using the product,” Systrom concludes. “We can either let the system evolve the way it evolves — I think that’s a great consumption business. But we want to make sure to keep the soul of what made us love it at the beginning: Share whatever I want, when I want, with who I want. The daily use case.”

948,Sarah Perez,"Twitter this morning announced a change to how its Moments feature will work for those who want to follow the Rio 2016 Olympic Games via its platform. Previously, followable Moments were limited-time collections that would insert tweets into a user’s timeline for a matter of hours or, at most, a few days. But with the debut of the followable Olympics Moments, Twitter will insert Olympic-related tweets into a user’s timeline for weeks at a time.
The idea, explains the company, is to make it easier for people to follow the Games with minimal work. That is, instead of having to locate the right accounts to follow or search via hashtags or keywords, they can instead just choose to follow their favorite sports and events to see those tweets appear on their timeline.

This idea is smart, and brings Twitter back to its roots. Longtime Twitter users will remember an old feature called “Twitter Track,” which let you follow topics of interest, rather than having to follow accounts. It was something that made it easier to participate in the sort of conversations you cared about, but it eventually was overshadowed by search, hashtags and algorithmic timelines.
The Moments feature can also be used to catch up on what you missed during the day, thanks to recap Moments, which will highlight the results, medal counts, and other notable newsworthy items.
The live Olympic Moments for select sports and events will be available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. In these markets, plus Germany and France, users will be able to also follow country-specific Moments.
In addition to Moments, Twitter is rolling out 207 team emojis that will activate when users tweet with the three-letter country code hashtag for their favorite team. There will also be over 50 Olympics and sports emoji that can be triggered by hashtags, too. (The hashtags will be available in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish.)
Sports emojis as well as the main hashtags of #Rio2016 and #Olympics will also work in Japanese, Korean and Arabic.
This is the most emojis that Twitter has ever made for one event, the company notes.
Of course, Twitter is also pulling in its other properties to complement its Olympic coverage. Periscope will have a featured Olympic channel and Vine will also offer Olympics-related content in its “Explore” section on mobile.
For added flare, when you like an Olympics Vine, you’ll see an Olympics Flame instead of a heart.
Meanwhile, Twitter Amplify will bring video highlights from the events to Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.S..
Twitter, which is in need of growing its stagnant user base, is also planning to use the Games to heavily market its service. Life-sized hashtags will be installed across Rio; tweets will be projected live on Rio’s aqueduct Arcos da Lapa; “Olympic Boulevard” will feature Olympics-related tweets on big screens; and a tour buzz dubbed “Twitter Buzz” will display tweets and Periscope broadcasts through its windows.
All the emojis and types of Moments will be available in the days ahead, but the dedicated Moments section is available now.",2016-08-02,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/twitter-olympics.png?w=738,olympics,"Twitter revamps Moments for the Olympics, with weeks-long tracking of sports and events"
949,Jordan Crook,"Sensay, the chatbot startup that lets people ask for advice from fellow users, has today announced the close of a $4.5 million seed round extension led by Norwest Venture Partners. Other participants include Greycroft Partners, Sweet Capital, NHN, Draper Associates, as well as existing investors.
This brings Sensay’s total funding to $6 million.
Plus, the platform has also introduced Facebook Messenger to the platform, bringing it into the fold with other messaging platforms like Slack, Kik, Telegram and WeChat.
Sensay launched, back in May of 2015, as a purely SMS-based product, with a simple premise.
Users could sign up to both give and receive advice, with Sensay’s AI matching algorithm figuring out which users to pair with each other. Users could ask each other about restaurant recommendations, craft beer, how to sail, gift recommendations, or literally anything else.
As chatbots become more and more popular, it’s interesting to see Sensay use its technology for matching its users rather than answering questions. While this may allow for better, more nuanced answers to natural language questions, it also opens up the platform to making mistakes through its users’ human error. There are also issues with response time.
However, since launch (which was exclusively via SMS), Sensay has expanded to include cross-platform communication, where one SMS user might be asking questions to a user on Slack. Rose said that, in any given platform, between 35 percent and 50 percent of Sensay users are actually communicating with someone who is using a different messaging platform.
This makes the system more reliable, at least when it comes to response time.
Sensay reached 1 million SMS users before expanding to other platforms.
Though the company has yet to start generating revenue, the founders look at the platform as a marketplace, with the Sensay who is providing information acting as the merchant and the user asking for info acting as the customer.
Right now, those parties exchange a virtual currency in the form of tips, but the team is looking at other ways to monetize the actual content of these conversations.
“We see that around 50 percent of chats contain some type of digital or physical commerce opportunity in the peer to peer chat stream,” said Rose. “For example, jobs, gigs and product recommendations. We are measuring this activity and will experiment with monetization soon.”

950,Fitz Tepper,"If you watch a lot of Facebook Live broadcasts, get ready to see some ads.
The company is now testing short video ads that will play during breaks in Facebook Live broadcasts, they confirmed to Adage.
The move shouldn’t be a surprise for anyone who follows Facebook and their various video products. Video ads are lucrative for Facebook and a Live product devoid of ads would cause the company to miss out on tons of potential ad revenue.
So how will they work? That’s a little less clear. For now, the company is just letting “a small group of publishers” insert a short ad break in their Live videos. The ads can appear anywhere after five minutes into a live stream, and can last up to a maximum of 15 seconds.
Facebook reportedly told advertisers that during the beta all ads shown during Live broadcasts will be taken from other promoted video campaigns already running on Facebook, but it’s safe to assume if the test is successful advertisers may soon have the ability to create custom ads designated to be shown during Live broadcasts.
So what control will video publishers have? Adage reports that publishers can control what category of advertiser can show video during their stream, as well as turn it off if a Live feed isn’t appropriately themed to contain an ad (like a sensitive breaking news story).
And in terms of revenue – during the test period publishers aren’t able to receive a portion of the revenue generated from ads during their Live broadcasts, but could in the future depending on how Facebook decides to structure their Live ad product.
It’s also not clear yet if publishers will be able to set a designated “commercial break” where all viewers see an ad at once, or if Facebook will randomly commandeer a Live stream with a 15 second ad. If it’s the former and publishers can initiate a designated commercial break (and potentially generate revenue), it could actually be an ad product that publishers and content creators ends up liking.

951,Ingrid Lunden,"Yet one more significant piece of M&A in the online recruitment industry. Today Randstad Holdings, an Amsterdam-based human resources and recruitment specialist, announced that it would acquire job hunting portal Monster Worldwide, for $429 million in cash.
The deal works out to $3.40 per share in cash and is a premium on Monster’s share price at closing on Monday of $262 million. But it is a far cry from the heady days of 2000 — when Monster, which had gone public soon after being founded in 1999 (itself the result of a merger of two early job startups), had a share price of over $91 and a market cap of nearly $8 billion. Even in 2007, when its stock was around $51, Monster was valued as high as $5.5 billion. (Sound familiar? It’s a song that gets played out in many versions.)

It’s still an interesting exit for Monster, which was one of the veterans (and notably, survivors) from the first dot-com boom. It comes amid a spate of M&A activity in the space. Just in June, Monster itself acquired Jobr, a “Tinder for jobs.” And last month, Indeed.com acquired Simply Hired. Indeed itself is owned by Japan’s recruitment and HR giant, Recruit Holdings.
Monster will keep its brand and will operate as a separate entity, but the bigger idea here is to consolidate different aspects of the recruitment and employment industry for better economies of scale and a “portfolio of HR services,” in the words of Randstad.
“In an era of massive technological change, employers are challenged to identify better ways to source and engage talent,” said Jacques van den Broek, CEO of Randstad, in a statement. “With its industry leading technology platform and easy to use digital, social and mobile solutions, Monster is a natural complement to Randstad. The transaction is aligned with our Tech and Touch growth strategy and reflects our commitment to bringing labor supply and demand closer together to better connect the right people to the right jobs. We look forward to welcoming the Monster team and working together to shape the evolving global job industry.”
For Monster, this is an important move to combine with a strategic and adjacent business at a time when companies like Recruit are dwarfing it in the pure-play recruitment space. The company is active in 40 countries, and had around 50,000 employers in its database according to its Q1 report. But in comparison Simply Hired alone (as one Indeed property) covers some 50,000 employers.",2016-08-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/monster-homepage.jpg?w=738,,Randstad buys Monster for $429M as recruitment consolidation continues
952,Natasha Lomas,"Engineering problems can sometimes appear simple beside the amorphous challenges of regulating and managing cutting edge technology use within existing societal structures. But early-stage startup Flock is viewing the knotted intersection of technology and regulation as just another business opportunity.
The London-based big data startup is building a platform for performing real-time quantified risk analysis of of drone flights, including by applying AI to tracking data sourced from urban environments. Currently it’s focusing its efforts on the U.K. market.
It’s not building a sense-and-avoid object detection system — rather it’s licensing data pertaining to the position of buildings, people and cars in urban environments, as well as weather conditions, and feeding that into its risk assessment platform. Idea being for its software to analyze a planned drone flight in real-time and perform a “cost/benefit” analysis — to help insurers set premiums or drone operators decide whether or not to undertaken a given flight or not.
That’s Flock’s first product push. Down the line it’s also intending to apply machine learning algorithms to the urban data it’s getting in order to generate “real-time risk reduction” for drone operators via predictive assessments for drone flight scheduling — which it reckons could be used to power fully autonomous drone flights zipping along risk-minimized routes.
“The idea is to have a robust trend analysis built in to the system so we can analyze historic data on all the data sources that we collect over a given period of time, and then build up a really good understanding of how cities move generally, how cities breathe, and how populations and traffic conditions change over time,” says Ed Leon Klinger, CEO.
“Therefore we can calculate the best route to take and the exact time to go, which is most efficient — both for internal logistics purposes and for external risk assessment purposes. So we’ll be using machine learning to formulate the predictions that we need that allows drones to intelligently navigate through cities and also be intelligently scheduled.”
All that’s yet to come. The team is still building the platform at this stage, with Klinger saying it’s hoping to have an MVP launched within six months. In the short term the plan is to partner with insurance and drone companies to run pilot schemes once it has that up and running. And if you’re wondering where it’s getting its data on city inhabitants’ movements, well it’s not disclosing that yet.
The startup was founded in March last year and has been funding development by bootstrapping and multiple R&D grants from Innovate UK thus far. They’re in the process of raising a seed round.
On the competition front, there’s AirMap in the market already, which raised a $16 million Series A round back in April — and which provides drone operators with airspace information to help them figure out when and where to fly. But Klinger argues Flock’s focus on real-time analytics of urban data is different vs AirMap mapping “static regulation”, as he puts it.
(Although AirMap disagrees with Flock’s characterization — noting it does provide real-time data to drone operators, such as hyperlocal weather conditions, wildfire alerts, traffic alerts, stadium events, presidential movements and other “flight-critical events”, via partnerships with The Weather Company and the US Department of the Interior.)
Flock targeting insurers and risk assessment makes for a bit of a different spin though, with AirMap focusing more on airports and drone makers.
“In four or five years time we want to be embedded in every single autonomous drone globally. We want to be the company that’s providing contextual data in cities and urban environments generally, and keeping drones safe,” says Klinger.
“There’s huge potential that drones can serve in urban areas… you’ve got congested traffic, you’ve got pollution and smog, it would help so much if we could take some of the strain off the road and put it in the air. There’s also a tonne of data to be collected by drones and aerial photography that could be done by drones in urban areas, but it’s just so difficult because of the fact that it’s risky,” he adds.

954,"Ingrid Lunden,Steve O'Hear","Deliveroo, a popular on-demand restaurant food delivery startup in Europe, has raised another $275 million in funding, a Series E investment that we have heard from sources values the company at around $1 billion. This latest round is led by new investor, Bridgepoint, previous investors DST Global and General Catalyst, and also had participation from existing investor Greenoaks Capital.
Deliveroo says the investment will go into growing its service in both new and existing markets, where it’s now live in 84 cities. It’s also going to keep investing in its new initiatives. These include a new B2B remote kitchen service, RooBox, which gives restaurants access to delivery-only kitchens in key locations. Other new services have included an expansion into alcohol delivery.
Deliveroo, which is not confirming its valuation, has now raised $475 million to date.
This latest funding comes at a time when the startup is facing a lot of heat from others who are also targeting the higher, foodie end of the prepared food market (typical Deliveroo restaurants include artisanal pizza and burger joints, trendy Middle Eastern delis, and hipster donut bakeries).
Rivals include Uber, which has stormed into Europe with UberEATS, as well as others like Delivery Hero and Just Eat, and now, it seems, Amazon too (whose own food delivery project in Europe is currently codenamed “Hot Wheels”).
The intense competition in the market has led to a distinctly sink-or-swim climate, with other hopefuls like Take Eat Easy closing down last week after failing to raise money.
Sky News reported news of Deliveroo’s round earlier today, and we have confirmed the details with Deliveroo directly.
“After seeing strong growth in the markets we launched in November, our new focus is to drive further innovation in food delivery,” founder and CEO Will Shu said in a statement. “In particular, I’m excited about exploring completely new ways to solve the hardest problems restaurants face when offering delivery. RooBox is the first illustration of this approach, and innovations like these are at the heart of our mission. We’re proud and honoured to have the support of Bridgepoint, DST Global and General Catalyst in this endeavour.”
We had been hearing about Deliveroo’s attempts to raise this round for months now, and our information came with several other interesting details.
For one, we were told that this round has been taking some time to close — nine months, by one person’s estimate — as the size and terms have fluctuated.
Also, multiple sources allege the company had hired Morgan Stanley either to help arrange financing for this deal, or potentially to find a buyer for the company. Among those that were approached as potential buyers or partners: Uber, Delivery Hero, Amazon, Just Eat and Takeaway.com.
To be clear, Deliveroo denies conversations about partnerships or acquisitions and says that the round was oversubscribed.
Deliveroo, meanwhile, has been growing. It says that since its last round of funding ($100 million in November 2015), it has grown 400 percent and “reached profitability in a number of its established markets,” which would include London. It has also added 29 new cities and 9,000 new restaurant partners to its footprint in the last eight months.
And if we’re in a sink-or-swim climate at the moment, for now competitors are just happy to see Deliveroo seal the deal, since rising tides will help lift all (remaining) boats. “It’s good news that they managed to finally close,” another food delivery founder told me. “I think everyone was nervous it would be one of Europe’s largest failures… It would have affected the whole industry.”
Notably, Uber opted to partner up and sell off its operation in China to arch rival Didi Chuxing after it proved too costly to compete against it. Whether that might be a precedent for other geographies and categories beyond basic transport remains to be seen.
For now, there has been a lot of competition between Deliveroo and UberEATS in markets like London, not just to secure restaurants for delivery and to find loyal customers, but also to pick up drivers to complete orders.
Anecdotally, drivers we’ve interviewed who have made the leap to Uber from Deliveroo tell us the pay is better — meaning Uber’s competing by sacrificing margin to gain market share.
Confusingly (or serendipitously?), the green-lettered black delivery boxes for UberEATS and Deliveroo look nearly identical.
Deliveroo says that since its Series D, it has added 6,500 new riders to its network.

The launch of the OnePlus 3 marked a brave new, invite-free world — one that’s apparently come with a few growing pains as the company works to meet demand.
Co-founder Carl Pei took to the company’s forums to announce that it will be halting sales of the device throughout Europe for four days, in order to deal with what has proven to be “the fastest selling device we’ve ever made.”

So, why hating, rather than simply delaying shipping? Aside from an opportunity to point out the brisk pace with which the solid new handset is moving, Pei had this to say, “We are working hard to secure more stock and fire up more production lines so that we can fulfill our goal of putting premium products into the hands of as many people as possible.”

956,Natasha Lomas,"There are signs that a growing number of Brits are feeling overwhelmed by the never-ending demands of digital technology, with many web users attempting to reset the balance between their online and offline lives by taking a temporary break from connected devices.
The finding comes from U.K. telecoms watchdog Ofcom’s 13th annual Communications Market report, which offers a yearly deep-dive into the domestic digital and media consumption landscape. (You can read the full report here.)
Ofcom found that one in three UK internet users (or some 15 million people) have, in 2016, deemed there’s too much tech in their life — going on to take a so-called ‘digital detox’ to try to regain control over their devices.
A quarter of these reported spending up to a day internet free; a fifth took a week off; and 5 percent somehow managed to be web-free for up to a month.

One in 10 had apparently even taken a self-enforced break from their screens in the past week alone. The figures were extrapolated from a study of 2,025 U.K. adults and 500 teenagers, conducted by Ofcom.
The watchdog also found that many internet users relished their self-enforced breaks, with a third (33 percent) reporting they felt more productive; and 27 percent describing it as “liberating,” while a quarter said they “enjoyed life more.” Not exactly a great verdict for tech.
On the negative side, 16 percent of detoxers reported experiencing FOMO during their break, 15 percent described themselves as feeling “lost” and 14 percent as “cut-off.”
The report also unearths some distinctly addict-style behavior among U.K. tech (over)users, with almost half (49 percent) reporting time spent online eating into hours originally intended for other tasks. More than a third (37 percent) said the same was true of their use of social media.
Activities being neglected because Brits are overusing the internet include housework (reported by 48 percent); sleep and rest (47 percent); and spending time with friends and family (31 percent). So technology is making Brits more messy, tired and antisocial.
One in five (22 percent) internet users also admitted to being late for a meeting with friends or family because they’d been sucked into stuff online, while 13 percent said they’d been made late for work because of their use of tech.

Tech’s attention-sucking ways appear even more pronounced for U.K. teens, with a quarter (26 percent) reportedly being late for school as a result of web use, and the majority (60 percent) of teenagers neglecting school work to spend time online.
Unsurprisingly, Ofcom also found many U.K. parents are limiting children’s time online, with 61 percent of teens who use a connected device reporting being digitally grounded, having their device taken away or its usage restricted. Although you can imagine teenagers fuming about hypocritical parents as a result.
For adult Internet users in the U.K., Ofcom found they’re spending an average of one day per week (25 hours) online, with 42 percent reporting they go online or check apps more than 10 times a day, and a truly addicted one in 10 (11 percent) accessing the internet more than 50 times daily.
While Brit web users are clearly very wedded to the internet, they are at least not in denial about their addiction: a majority (59 percent) of Internet users describe themselves as “hooked” on their connected device. And a third (34 percent) admitted they find it difficult to disconnect.
The Ofcom report also charts a particular rise in the use of instant messaging in the UK, which is likely to be contributing to the feeling of being overwhelmed by time-sapping tech, given the ceaseless demands of open-ended real-time messaging chats which — unlike other comms technologies — don’t have clear or natural cut-off points.
Ofcom found that the proportion of U.K. adults using services such as Facebook Messenger and the Facebook-owned WhatsApp messaging app at least once per week rose from under a third (28 per cent) back in 2014 to approaching a majority (43 per cent) in 2016 — which it flags as the biggest increase across all comms and media activities it charts in the report.
It notes that instant messaging is also considered the single most important means of communication among 16- to 24-year-olds, with 36 percent citing it as their top comms medium.
Also on an uptick in the U.K.: photo or video messaging services, such as Snapchat, which are now used by a fifth (21 percent) of U.K. adults on a weekly basis, up from 14 percent in 2014.
Email and texting (SMS) remain the most common methods of text-based communication, at 70 per cent and 63 percent respectively in a given week, although usage of both has declined on 2014 levels (seven percentage points and eight percentage points, respectively).
Other findings from the report include:

957,Natasha Lomas,"Walking around the neighborhood handing out CVs in the hopes of scoring shifts in a local cafe or restaurant has never been an efficient job-search process. But workers in the service industry still do it. London-based startup inploi is hoping to change that — it’s gunning to replace the paper CV with a mobile profile and location-based jobs platform.
The founders say they came up with the idea after trying to find hospitality work themselves during their university holidays — a process they found to be time-consuming and frustrating. “We realised that employers were also spending too much time and money, hiring the people they need.”
inploi, which launched in beta late last month, is actually one of several European startups chasing high-turnover service industry jobs with a new recruitment modus operandi via a smartphone chat app — with the likes of Accel-backed JobToday, Barcelona-based CornerJob and Atomico-backed Jobandtalent all spying similar opportunities here: looking to leverage the speed, familiarity and convenience of mobile messaging to kill off the paper CV.
But inploi, which is backed by £200,000 in pre-seed financing at this point (raised in January from a group of friends, family, angels, a Chicago-based family office and a Johannesburg-based investment fund), reckons its positioning is a little different versus the better-resourced regional competition. It argues rivals are taking existing structures — such as the job board model or the staffing agency model — and optimizing them for mobile, whereas inploi claims it’s aiming for a more radical rethinking of how recruitment is done in this sector.
“‘Agency’ model startups still act as intermediaries, charging significant markups on the labour that they broker. Optimised jobs boards (like JobToday, for instance) still uses the volume of candidates that they can send an employer as a selling point — we think that this misses the point. inploi is working to drive the candidate-to-hire ratio down by reimagining the process entirely, saving everybody time, and money,” co-founder Matthew de la Hey tells TechCrunch.
“On one level we are building a recruitment-driven ‘LinkedIn’ for the service economy, rather than a mobile optimised jobs board. On a more macro level we want to change the way that staffing works at this end of the economy entirely, providing workers with credible ‘working passports’ with which they can get more and better work.”
Job seekers using the inploi app create a profile with their experience and skills (users can also create a short intro video for their profile if they wish), as well as specifying their hourly rate and location, in order to be matched with relevant job opportunities — applying in-app if they wish to do so.
De la Hey concedes the matching element is “fairly binary” at this nascent stage, but the intention is to hone it over time based on data generated by usage of the platform — such as response rates and reviews.
The platform covers both gig economy one-offs and full-time positions. So as well as matching job seekers with permanent roles, the aim is also to be a marketplace for one-off staffing needs, such as for festivals or corporate events, starting at one shift to up to five days’ work. In that instance, inploi handles the entire transaction in the app, with payment powered by Stripe.
A key facet of the inploi platform is ratings, with de la Hey noting that both staff and employers are expected to be rated. (For gig work, ratings are provided at the point of payment after the work has been completed; for full-time roles employers are prompted to rate hired workers “after a period of time” and vice versa.)
“The review system is mutual,” he notes, talking up inploi’s wider “mission” to try to equalize the relationship between employers and workers, which he argues is “too often skewed towards the former.” And, he adds, “The reviews employers receive from workers are private. Workers are rated across five areas — punctuality, presentation, co-operation, communication, and quality of work, in addition to short written feedback. These are public. However, in order to avoid possible ‘downward spiral’ situations we will only make an employee’s reviews public once the employer reviewing them has received five or more 4/5 Star reviews from workers, rendering them a ‘trusted employer’.”
“Employers who consistently receive bad reviews from workers will be removed from the inploi community,” he adds.
inploi also offers a dashboard view for its enterprise users, providing them with what it dubs “key HR data” on things like staff hire costs, applicant volumes, labor turnover rates and market wage positions. “To our knowledge this is unique. In time as the data we have becomes more comprehensive our matching algorithm will become smarter and develop into a key piece of our technology,” adds de la Hey.
inploi launched its mobile recruitment platform on iOS a couple of weeks ago (an Android app is slated as coming soon), focusing initially on London and the U.K., and on the hospitality industry specifically — although de la Hey says he also sees future potential to expand into other sectors with similar characteristics down the line, such as retail, domestic work, security staff, construction and railway workers.
At this point, inploi has 65 employers signed up to offer jobs through the app, ranging from single-site establishments to multi-site chains — including Bill’s, the Corbin & King Group, YouMeSushi, Daylesford and Deliveroo.
While the potential reach of participating employers is around 700 sites across the U.K., less than 50 jobs are listed at present, and inploi has less than 500 job seekers. So it’s certainly very early days for the startup, albeit no one dominant mobile app network has emerged yet for this segment, so there’s plenty to play for.
And while inploi is U.K.-specific right now, with an immediate focus on EMEA, the team’s wider goal is to build a global marketplace — with de la Hey noting possible future expansion opportunities in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa.
In terms of business model, while the platform is free for job seekers to use, inploi charges employers seeking to fill permanent positions on a freemium tiered basis — so it’s free for small employers with limited hiring needs but larger employers with more activity are charged if they wish to interact with candidates applying for jobs they have posted, including using the in-app chat feature. To do this, employers have to connect with applicants, and it charges for the number of connections on a volume-driven sliding scale, says de la Hey.
For gig work, via its QuickShift marketplace, inploi adds a service fee onto the total amount paid by the employer at the point of paying the finished job.",2016-08-04,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/p1040673.jpg?w=738,"recruitment,human-resource-management,job-hunting,employment",inploi is another jobs app that wants to kill off the service industry CV
958,Steve O'Hear,"London-based City Pantry, which operates an office catering platform to make it easier to order in food for staff and company meetings, has raised £1.1 million in new funding. The investment comes from Angel Co Fund, and The London Co Investment fund (both of which are part-funded by tax-payer money), and various angels and existing investors.
A graduate of retail startup accelerator TrueStart, City Pantry says it will use the injection of cash to consolidate its strong position in London and to expand to other cities, both in the U.K. and elsewhere in Europe. It also plans to invest in sales, marketing and engineering.
In a call, the startup’s founder and CEO Stuart Sunderland told me that competitors to City Pantry include traditional corporate caterers, sandwich retailers, pizza delivery places, and to a lesser extent, the newer breed of restaurant delivery companies such as Deliveroo and Uber’s UberEATs.
In terms of direct competitors operating a similar office catering platform/marketplace, there’s also Rocket Internet’s CaterWings. However, Sunderland says he’s barely noticed any impact on City Pantry since CaterWings opened its doors in London. And besides, he says, the corporate or events-based catering market is huge. Specifically, he cites estimates that the European catering market is worth £48 billion alone.
To that end, City Pantry currently offers two products: a simple per event ordering system for one-off catering, and a “meal plan” subscription service for office managers who have to organise regular staff meetings and company events where food is to be provided.
The food itself is prepared by the catering companies — including independent chefs, restaurants, and street-food vendors — that City Pantry partners with, while the startup itself organises delivery. Sunderland says that the average group size City Pantry is asked to cater for is 34 people.
And should Deliveroo et al. begin to eat more of the corporate catering lunch, City Pantry could always expand into other group catering markets, such as parties or other recreational and social events. Just like office food, its order-ahead-of-time, rather than on-demand delivery, is well suited.",2016-08-03,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/screen-shot-2016-08-03-at-08-43-22.png?w=738,"caterwings,city-pantry",London-based City Pantry picks up £1.1M to grow office catering marketplace
959,Steve O'Hear,"3D Hubs, an online marketplace for 3D printing services, is tapping into two recent trends enabled by industrial 3D printing: the rapid prototyping of new products, and the move to personalised and bespoke production.

The latter, of course, is also powering “zero-inventory” manufacturing: products are only produced on a per-order basis (and in some instances are also fulfilled directly to the end customer), which is another trend that is starting to gain traction.
To help further its mission to create a connected network of 3D printing services, 3D Hubs has closed $7 million in Series B funding. The round was led by EQT Ventures, with backing from previous investor Balderton Capital. Ted Persson, Design Partner at EQT Ventures, will join the 3D Hubs Board.
“We’ve connected 3D printers from around the world to our online platform to let anybody access them,” 3D Hubs co-founder and CEO Bram de Zwart told me during a call last week. “So if you don’t own a 3D printer, you can go to our website and upload your design and we route your order to the best local supplier.”
He says those supplies span 33,000 3D printers world-wide, capable of different kinds of 3D printing and materials. That means that, along with hobbyist manufacturers who were early to the platform, 3D Hubs is now primarily used by professional product designers and manufacturers who prefer not only the choice that a 3D printing marketplace can offer but also the convenience 3D Hubs provides when placing repeat orders and so on.
That’s because, de Zwart says, the startup has worked hard at streamlining the ordering and quotation features, including tech that can check the integrity of any uploaded CAD file and spot any problems in around 90 per cent of cases.
Meanwhile, the 3D Hubs CEO, who is undoubtedly well-positioned to know, tells me he thinks 3D printing is and will lead to a renaissance in local manufacturing, as many products in the future move away from mass, largely Asia-based production.
This, he says, is already seeing different 3D printers selected depending on where in the world the resulting products are to be shipped, not where the design of the products originate. In this way, 3D Hubs enables companies to have a 3D printer (and, potentially, fulfillment too) located anywhere their customers are, says de Zwart.",2016-08-02,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/dsc00356.jpg?w=738,3d-hubs,"3D Hubs, an online marketplace for local 3D printing, scores $7M Series B"

It’s part of a short spate of acquisitions that Verizon has been making lately to expand those operations: about six weeks ago, Verizon Telematics announced that it would acquire Telogis (financial terms undisclosed).
More generally, the acquisition of Fleetmatics points to ways that Verizon is continuing to use its balance sheet to finance investments into newer areas to offset continuing declines in its core, legacy business of basic phone services. As that market has become increasingly commoditized and people turn to other, digitised forms of communication away from traditional voice services, Verizon is hoping to invest into newer areas to move beyond “dumb pipe” status to keep its margins up, and revenues growing.
While its acquisition of AOL (and now Yahoo) will help Verizon scale up its media, advertising and content operations, Fleetmatics is pointing straight to Verizon’s ambitions in enterprise services, and specifically enterprise mobility.
The wider context of that market is interesting.
On one hand, there are traditional customers for these services: companies that employ fleets of workers who are constantly on the move as part of the companies’ wider operations (Fleetmatics’ existing customers include businesses like Time Warner Cable and DirecTV).
The boom in smartphone services and enterprise mobility has given this customer base a wider range of tools to do these jobs better, and Verizon wants to be their go-to for purchasing them.
On the other, there is a growing new market, too: companies like Uber have been investing a lot to build out a logistics business that goes beyond the transportation of people, and there are a number of other startups (and much larger players, like Amazon) that are hoping to disrupt more traditional providers of services to move things from points A to B. Verizon is buying into the technology used for these services as well, as another way to increase the revenues it makes from enterprises, beyond basic network connectivity.
Fleetmatics is an SaaS-based provider of GPS and other services to fleets and companies with mobile workforces. It has 37,000 customers, 737,000 subscribers and 1,200 employees. The services that it offers include location services, driver and car security services, fuel tracking, dispatching and billing/invoice services.
The company has been publicly traded since 2012 and the deal is equivalent to $60 per share in cash, Verizon said. When it was private, Fleetmatics had raised over $93 million from investors like IVP.
Verizon Telematics CEO Andres Irlando says the deal was done to build up its telematics services for small and medium businesses.
“Fleetmatics is a market leader in North America — and increasingly internationally — and they’ve developed a wide-range of compelling SaaS-based products and solutions for small- and medium-sized businesses,” he said in a statement. We will be talking with him later and will ask if there are more deals of this kind to come.",2016-08-01,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/shutterstock_427490584.jpg?w=738,"logistics,telematics,fleetmatics,verizon",Verizon buys Fleetmatics for $2.4B in cash to step up in telematics
961,Natasha Lomas,"U.S. companies needing to transfer personal data of European customers across the Atlantic can now sign up to a new framework to govern such data transfers, with the so-called EU-US Privacy Shield up and running from today.
The European Commission has also now published the legal texts associated with the Privacy Shield agreement, along with a citizens guide — which aims to provide information to EU consumers detailing how they can make complaints about the handling of their data by US companies should they feel the need to.
The new data-transfer deal was officially adopted by the EC last month, bringing to a close some nine months of limbo in the wake of the region’s Court of Justice decision to topple the predecessor framework last year (while failing entirely to end the uncertainty that the demise of Safe Harbor has wrought — given that critics continue to question Privacy Shield’s robustness to future legal challenge).
The EC has claimed the new deal is fundamentally different versus the prior self-certification Safe Harbor framework, flagging up the new role it creates of a dedicated US ombudsman to handle EU citizens’ complaints, as well as pointing to various assurances provided by the US government on the limits of bulk collection of data for national security purposes.
Companies signing up to the Shield also face new obligations, such as deleting personal data when it is no longer necessary. And there’s an annual joint review process built in to the framework so that it will be continually reviewed and any problems tackled.
However, the influential Working Party 29 body — which is made up of the heads of the various Member States’ data protection agencies — remains critical of the Privacy Shield, despite what it sees as some improvements over Safe Harbor.
In a statement put out late last month the WP29 said it remains concerned about various commercial aspects of the framework, flagging up the lack of specific rules on automated decisions and of a general right to object as problems. It also criticized a lack of clarity about how Privacy Shield Principles apply to processors.
The body also expressed ongoing concern about access by public authorities to data transferred to the U.S. under the Privacy Shield.
“[T]he WP29 would have expected stricter guarantees concerning the independence and the powers of the Ombudsperson mechanism,” it wrote. “Regarding bulk collection of personal data, the WP29 notes the commitment of the ODNI not to conduct mass and indiscriminate collection of personal data. Nevertheless, it regrets the lack of concrete assurances that such practice does not take place.”
The group looked ahead to the first joint annual review of the framework, couching it as a “key moment” for assessing the robustness and efficiency of the mechanism.
In the meanwhile, it added that individual DPAs will be committing themselves to assisting EU citizens in their countries with exercising their rights under the Shield, especially vis-a-vis complaints.
In the EC Citizens Guide to the Privacy Shield, the EU notes that citizens can check the Privacy Shield list on the US Department of Commerce website to determine whether a company has signed up to the framework. At the time of writing there was just under two hours remaining before US companies can self-certify to adhere to Privacy Shield so no companies are listed as yet.
Following the demise of Safe Harbor, companies have been using a range of alternative mechanisms to govern personal data transfers, such as contractual clauses and binding corporate rules, so it remains to be seen whether there will be a rush to adopt the Privacy Shield or not. Some of these other data transfer mechanisms are also currently subject to legal challenge.",2016-08-01,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/shutterstock_1415258531.jpg?w=738,"personally-identifiable-information,eu-us-privacy-shield,human-rights,privacy",EU-US Privacy Shield open for sign ups from today
962,Jon Russell,"You may have heard of stickers, the cutesy, cartoonish version of emojis, but did you know that they can also be a money-spinner?
Japanese mobile messaging app Line is banking more than $20 million per month selling sticker packs, which typically trade for $1-2 for sets of 12-18, according to data from the company.
Line finally filed for a dual U.S.-Japanese IPO last Friday following aborted efforts in 2014 and 2015, thereby opening some of its previously tightly guarded financial information to public eyes.
It’s not an overstatement to say that Line has single-handedly pioneered stickers, which are now a fairly staple part of most social apps. But, beyond being cute, they generated the company an altogether-not-too-shabby JPY 28,725 million ($271 million) in revenue in 2015 — that’s up 38 percent on the previous year.
It’s also more than double the already impressive $10 million that the company was banking in 2013, and it accounts for around one-quarter of Line’s total sales. That’s important since Line is dependent on Japan for nearly 90 percent of its revenue, and stickers have appeal outside of the country and among more casual users. Indeed, Line said that its users send an average of 389 million stickers — paid and free — each day, that’s around nine percent of the total number of messages sent on the service daily.
Stickers aren’t the only surprising form of income for Line: the company also disclosed that it made over JPY 2 billion ($18.8 million) from sales of merchandising and licensing deals last year for its Line characters, the figures who star in its sticker packs and front its brand. That’s double the 2014 figure.

Characters like Brown the mute but caring bear and impulsive, emotional figure Moon have made the leap from chat app to small screen via a TV show that started out in Line’s native Japan but have been exported worldwide. But Line also cashes in on its faces through a number of physical stores in Asia and beyond — such as the one we visited in Korea — that sell all manner of merchandising, from mugs, to pillows, plush dolls and actual physical stickers.
Together, the stickers and merchandising account for nearly one-third of Line’s total revenue, but they also help put a face on the app which the company thinks can help it win new markets. It remains to be seen if now, in the year 2016 with the messaging space long matured, whether dislodging a chat app in a country is even possible, but Line certainly has a strong brand which could resonate among other parts of Asia, where most of its 215 million active users are based.
Ultimately Line makes most of its money through focused advertising and games and it hasn’t broken even yet. But, if nothing else, its sticker and merchandising sales show that the offline component to digital businesses shouldn’t be underestimated.",2016-06-13,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/line-stickers.png?w=738,"mobile-messaging,messaging,stickers,line",Chat app Line makes over $270 million a year from selling stickers
963,Jon Russell,"Can’t beat ’em, join ’em. That appears to be the thinking of China Life, Asia Pacific’s highest valued insurance firm, after it backed Chinese taxi app Didi Chuxing barely months after investing in fierce rival Uber.
Didi announced today that it has scored $600 million in fresh financing from the insurance company, half of which will go towards its latest funding round which a spokesperson confirmed has now exceeded $3.5 billion but is still to close. That’s likely to value Didi around the $25 billion mark and will include the surprise $1 billion investment from Apple that was announced one month ago.
Last summer, China Life invested in Uber Global last year although it has nor invested in Uber’s China business. Despite suggestions and reports to the contrary (not to mention a “no comment” from Uber China), a China Life spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that its investment is within the global entity of Uber only. Nonetheless, now it is covering its bases and providing capital to Didi in two ways: via an equity investment of $300 million, which will go towards the aforementioned round, and a separate “long-term debt investment” of RMB 2 billion (around $305 million).
Didi, which claims 14 million daily rides on its service and counts Tencent and Alibaba as investors, said the strategic investment will see the companies work together on a range of initiatives that will include new insurance and financial services. That’ll also include “investment opportunities in mobile transportation and related sectors in China and beyond,” the company said.
It’s often hard to decode the generalities in media announcements, particularly with Uber and its rivals, but China Life is grappling on to Didi, which claims 300 million users of its taxi, chauffeur, bus and other services, to unlock new opportunities. Didi claims it works with 15 million car owners which is obviously very appealing to an insurance company. Did has already aligned itself with Ping An, a fellow insurance firm that invested in a $2 billion round last summer, but that’s not where the alliances end.
Uber China, which believes it can overtake Didi over the next year, counts Hong Kong-based China Taiping Insurance among its investor list, which also includes Baidu, airline firm HNA Group, automaker GAC, and investment bank CITIC Securities.
The two companies share two other investors beyond China Life. Both China-based Hillhouse Capital and New York’s Tiger Global have invested in Didi and Uber although, unlike China Life, both firms backed Didi first before investing in the U.S. firm.

964,Dennis Mitzner,"

Finland-based mobile payment app Tapp Commerce has raised $9 million to expand its operations in Southeast Asia for users without a bank account or credit card.
Mobile phones have emerged as the dominant alternative payment method to cash for buying and selling goods and services in emerging markets. And with a service akin to alternative payment providers like M-Pesa and Pagatech in Africa and a slew of alternative payment platforms in Southeast Asia, it’s a technology that the region understands well.
Headquartered in the Finnish city of Turku, with product development in Helsinki and offices around Asia, Tapp’s Series A round was raised from Australia-based Amma Private Equity — an early-stage investment network — and brings the total amount invested in the company to $12.9 million.
With the new funds, Tapp will strengthen operations in Indonesia and expand to new markets. The company currently employs a staff of 77.
“Tapp will use the funding to expand faster into Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, with an eye to also open up Myanmar by the end of 2016. Funds will also be used in consumer acquisition efforts and continuing to build platform services which continue to reward for participation and create stickiness in our end user value chain,” said Warren Sample, the CEO of Tapp.
Tapp Commerce’s consumer app, Tapp Market, allows people without bank accounts or credit cards to upload cash on the app to buy goods and services online via a network of sellers in emerging markets.
With Tapp, users can prepay for electricity, tuition fees, microinsurance, airtime and music. Anyone can become an agent — someone who can accept cash in exchange for digital currency —  with data and some cash.
Again, this is a market that’s already fairly crowded. Ayannah, backed by Golden Gate Ventures and other local venture capitalists; 1Pay in Vietnam; and 2C2P all aim to provide payment services for the underbanked.

On the street level, Tapp wants to emulate existing — cash-based — consumer behavior in local markets. The company’s sales strategy is to onboard trusted local shop owners to give shoppers an option to convert their coins and bills — through the app — into digital currency in order to expand their buying options.
For businesses, Tapp’s main partners are merchants, such as insurance and electricity companies. Tapp has 134 merchant partners in Indonesia and the Philippines. In April, the company partnered with Indonesia-based insurance company Jaya Proteksi, a member of ACE Group, to provide microinsurance customers in Indonesia.
The app currently works only on Android and is used by more than 30,000 vendors with 3 million buyers in Southeast Asia, according to a press release.
The worldwide mobile payment volume in 2015 was $450 billion, and is expected to surpass $1 trillion in 2019. According to McKinsey, 2.5 billion adults worldwide — of which 2.2 billion live in the developing world — do not have a bank account. Couple this with the fact that smartphone adoption is increasing at a rapid rate in the emerging markets.
With the mobile phone becoming a popular payment vehicle across the globe, countries like Indonesia and the Philippines are in dire need of independent payment solutions that do not require credit cards or bank accounts.
“P2P mobile payments and mobile wallets are a great way to enable digital financial inclusion in these developing countries,” said Smrithi Konanur, a Global Product Manager for Payments, Web and Mobile at HPE Data Security.
Most mobile payment alternatives to bank accounts and credit cards are SMS-based. Tapp is competing for the market share against local players such as Kudo and Cyrusku in Indonesia and LoadCentral in the Philippines.
Tapp’s most formidable competitor is Vietnam-based MoMo, which recently landed a $28 million investment from Standard Chartered (SCB) and Goldman Sachs.

One of the reasons why Google, Apple and Samsung — popular in the West — will remain less attractive to users in parts of Asia or Africa is their need for a credit card and reliance on existing banking infrastructures. That’s why companies you’ve never heard of, except for Alipay in China and M-Pesa in Africa, have a fighting chance.
Platforms and apps that tap into the existing cash economy without involving banks or credit card companies can be expected to thrive.
“The basic issue in the developing world is that more people have a Facebook account than a bank account. Credit cards are actually irrelevant as only basic banking services are required. We learned that only 23 percent of people in the Philippines have a bank account. Most transactions today are carried out in cash,” said Ron Hose, the CEO of Coins.ph, a mobile wallet in the Philippines.
Although there’s plenty of hype around a cashless future, with Sweden taking the lead, some countries are bucking the trend. In Indonesia alone there are 250 million people, but only 7-8 percent have a credit card and the amount of credit cards will likely reduce because of the country’s recent decree requiring credit card providers to submit transaction details.",2016-06-12,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/11149789815_b9c1ed8a57_k.jpg?w=738,"momo,indonesia,pagatech,africa",P2P mobile payment app Tapp raises $9 million to tap into the cash economy in Southeast Asia
965,Ingrid Lunden,"Two years after the first reports of an IPO emerged, Japan’s Line Corporation — the company behind the popular messaging app Line, and possibly the first of the big messaging apps to go public — today announced that it has filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange in the U.S. and the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Japan, trading as LN. The company today said in a news release that the NYSE listing is planned for July 14 with the Tokyo listing on July 15. The Tokyo exchange has already approved its listing of common stock, and the SEC F-1 filing for the U.S. part of the IPO will appear later today, the company added.
The announcement in English linked above did not provide details of how much Line, which is valued at over $4 billion, plans to raise, but those numbers have been made public on documents filed on the Tokyo exchange (in Japanese), and Line has confirmed the numbers to me directly: it hopes to raise $1 billion (113 billion yen) in the IPO, offering 35 million shares with an over-allotment of 5.25 million shares and 13 million of that in Japan. Pricing will be set June 27, with final price revealed July 11. The offering values the company at ¥588 billion ($5.5 billion).
The company tells me that it now has 218 million monthly active users globally, with 152 million in its top 4 countries in Asia. It will be aiming to use the huge fundraise to take on growth in new markets.
“After rounds of serious investigations, we determined that it is important that we are evaluated on the same market as other top global services. Furthermore, listing on the NYSE will help strengthen our branding as a global company,” a spokesperson told me. “LINE is a company that takes on challenges, and our simultaneous listing in Japan and the US is a declaration that we are ready to take on the world.”
Competitors like Messenger and WhatsApp, both owned by Facebook, cumulatively have billions of users. Other rivals include Rakuten-owned Viber and China’s WeChat (owned by Tencent). Line is one of the biggest of the messaging apps to still remain independent of any larger owner, and the first to go public.
Line has been evaluating an IPO since 2014, with the first reports emerging exactly two years to the date of its proposed actual listing.
“LINE, a principal subsidiary of the Company, is evaluating a potential listing in Japan and/or the United States. In connection therewith, LINE has submitted certain documentation, including a listing application, to relevant authorities such as the Tokyo Stock Exchange,” a company spokesperson at the time told me in an email. “However, determinations regarding whether to ultimately list, listing venue and listing timing, etc, have not been made. We will provide an update once such determinations are made or within one month of this disclosure.”
It’s not clear whether Line thought the market would rise even more ahead, or if it still thought it could use a delay to scale more before a listing and use the time to improve its monetization. All of those have happened to some extent, with the launch of a raft of new services and features, some of which (such as third-party services ordered, paid for and delivered within the app’s messaging framework) replicated elsewhere.
But on the financial front, times have really changed in the last two years. When reports first emerged of the company looking to list, it was actually estimated to be valued at around ¥1 trillion — almost double today’s valuation, which is a mark perhaps of how over-inflated prices were then, or how tough the messaging market is and appears to be consolidating rapidly with the big simply getting bigger.
The NYSE proposed IPO, the company said, will be of a new listing of American Depository Shares representing shares of common stock. It’s notable not just for the size of the IPO, but also because of the fact that this is the first time that a Japanese company is listing both in Tokyo and the NYSE.",2016-06-10,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/screen-shot-2016-06-10-at-09-25-35.png?w=738,"ipo,messaging,naver,line","Messaging app Line files for IPO on NYSE on July 14, Tokyo July 15, trading as LN, to raise $1B"
966,Brooks Rainwater,"

In my recent travels through Singapore, I witnessed all that this city-state is doing to become a “Smart Nation.” My trip was instructive on many levels, but the primary point that became ever more apparent to me is how big of a cultural shift — rather than a technological shift — we all still need to go through to reach the future in a positive, rather than potentially fractious, way.
It’s one thing to be enmeshed in the ideas of self-driving vehicles, big data, the sharing economy and robots. To me, and those I am generally around, these ideas seem normalized. But when I talk to people throughout the U.S. who don’t often think about these things, the disruption is very real. The idea that a robot may take their job or automate what they do for a living is already happening, and it’s incredibly worrisome.
These fears, and the reality of rapid workforce shifts, are helping fuel the populist ideas gaining traction in the American presidential election — along with populist movements in Europe and Asia. Singapore’s Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan spoke about many of these disruptive forces during the InnovFest unBound conference. He discussed the idea that the global rise of populism on both left and right around the world is not a right-wing or socialist political revolution, but is in fact the result of us all living in a tech revolution.
Taking this from the global perspective to the very local, one example hit home to me recently when my 67-year-old father and I were having drinks and he started getting me talking about these things that I work on. When I inadvertently — and perhaps in retrospect, nonchalantly — talked about the potential demise of the people side of the trucking industry because of self-driving technology, the look on his face was wonder, mixed with a healthy dose of fright.
My father once drove a semi-truck (I remember riding in it with him as a child) and still knows people in that industry. At the same time, he’s a car guy who follows the latest trends. As a result, he is coming around to the idea of self-driving vehicles. To him, the fact that this technology will wipe out a lot of jobs became quite real that night.
Whether meaning to or not, in that moment, the magnitude of this shift became real to me, if in a different way. By visiting Singapore, some of the answers to how we might approach this rolling disruption became apparent to me in other ways.
Riding in a prototype self-driving car that nuTonomy is testing in an urban environment was illuminating, if a bit shaky at times. The fact that they are testing it in real city conditions certainly gave me additional insight into how the autonomous car transition will play out in the next few years. This was the what, but the how is what has become ever more interesting. And, the how starts with education and moves into demonstration.
Singapore is prototyping a far-reaching educational program with students that really spoke to me as a parent. As they so elegantly and very bureaucratically named it, Developing Computational Thinking as a National Capability integrates tech-enabled toys into everyday learning.
Watching a four-year-old master basic coding, not as the end goal, but as a byproduct of play, made me more hopeful that my dad’s and many others’ fears of these transformational technologies overrunning the workforce and taking all of our jobs only be one potential future rather than “the future.”
Instead, through co-creation, these technologies can make us better and extend our reach, much like the desktop computer did for the last generation. Children integrating greeting cards with circuits and LED lights are still coloring, cutting and creating with their own two hands. The new things they are making are better, and it was visible to me that the future does not have to be an “either/or,” but rather the next generation will embrace the “and.”
Then I saw primary-age students, around 10-11, building their own driverless car test tracks, using the Scratch Jr. programming language. Seeing this was like looking through a window into the future — a whole generation of children that will grow up not only thinking that cars should drive themselves, but helping to shape what this new world looks like.
What will these children — and so many more like them worldwide — ultimately create? What will the future workforce do? Who knows, but what does seem readily apparent is that the makers of tomorrow, the creators of tomorrow, are right here in front of us waiting to learn — and then teach us all.",2016-06-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/500853966.jpg?w=738,"singapore,robocalypse,autonomous-vehicles",The social side of autonomous cars and technological disruption
967,Jon Russell,"Facebook is expanding its focus on payments with a new trial in Southeast Asia that allows users to pay for products listed on Facebook Pages with just a few clicks.
The social network is running a trial in Thailand which allows users to make a payment to a Page owner without leaving the social network. Qwik, a product powered by Southeast Asia-based fintech company 2C2P, which raised a $7 million Series C last year, allows users to make payment via a credit card, debit card or bank transfer online, according to numerous sources with knowledge of the trial.
Facebook and 2C2P both declined to comment.
The test might sound a little bizarre to anyone in the West, where the dominance of Facebook is under question thanks to the emergence of companies like Snapchat, but in Asia — China aside — the social network is an internet staple for most people. Indeed, Asia Pacific is its largest region with 566 million monthly users, according to Facebook’s latest data.
That social dominance in Asia also extends to commerce, with many small and independent retailers using Facebook Pages to build and engage their audience and, of course, sell products. It’s difficult to track transactions on social, but Page365, a Bangkok-based startup that helps small retailers sell products via social media, previously estimated the industry to be worth over $500 million per year in Thailand alone.
That figure came from 2014, and the social network no longer enables its pages to be crawled to make such estimates, but PWC reports that Thailand is the world’s largest c2c — consumer-to-consumer — commerce market with more than half of the people polled buying items from social networks.
Typically, the process of buying from social — which is mentioned in Mary Meeker’s latest report: slide 106 — goes something like this:
It’s a hugely cumbersome process that most people in emerging markets are forced to undertake. That’s because few have internet banking, the small number who do own a credit card can’t use it in this scenario, and cash-on-delivery isn’t preferred by small merchants.
Details aside, the key point is that people are so keen to buy online that they’ll jump through all manner of hoops to do.
The big problem for Facebook, however, is that many of these hoops don’t belong to the social network.
Page365 co-founder Prathan ‘Pop’ Thananart told us that, among his company’s base of 25,000-plus retail partners, nearly all transactions start on one social network and finish on another.
“One finding that is consistent across all our merchants, aside from customers engaging in chat-and-haggle buying behavior, is where those conversions happen. Merchants report that 80 percent of transactions are carried out across two or more platforms — most notable Facebook and Line,” he said.
That could mean buyers and sellers connect on Facebook but agree the final steps and payment via Line, Thailand’s top chat app with 30 million users in the country. Or, as is increasingly happening, Instagram is the key ‘store front’ for social commerce sellers to find their customers, with deals completed at non-Facebook properties like Shopee, the social commerce app from Singapore-based unicorn Garena.
This trial, which is more like alpha stage than even beta right now, is an early indicator of Facebook’s intent to keep all the processes of the social commerce transaction on its platform.
“While chat or ‘conversational commerce’ is the up-and-coming trend in the West, it’s already a reality in emerging Southeast Asia. In Thailand, for example, 33 percent of the total e-commerce spend is already going through Facebook and Instagram and ending on Line,” Sheji Ho, Group CMO of aCommerce, a startup that provides e-commerce marketing and logistics services for retailers, told TechCrunch.
TechCrunch understands that Facebook is trialling Qwik with an unspecified number of top Facebook Pages in Thailand, some of which have multiple millions of fans. Once a user taps the link, it redirects them to a new site where they can enter their credit/debit card details or provide their bank account which, with authorization, triggers a bank transfer like an ATM.
We’ve been in contact with a number of Facebook users who have successfully used the product this week, but we were unable to replicate the process ourselves.
We have seen screenshots of the transaction process but are not publishing them with this story since Page owners in the trial have signed NDAs and media coverage could impact their relationship with Facebook, which owns the platform that they are reliant on for a large portion of their online sales.
Multiple sources in Thailand’s e-commerce space told us that Facebook is planning to widen the trials to other countries in Southeast Asia over time, but it picked Thailand first because of the large market for social media commerce.
Either way, this trial is the loudest signal to date of Facebook’s interest in Southeast Asia and potentially other parts of Asia and emerging markets. The company has dabbled with commerce with a feature to let users find local services which is being tested in India and Indonesia, and, while the technology behind Qwik is hardly revolutionary, entering the payment space is a major move.
It isn’t clear when the trial was started, the users we talked with began to notice it this week, but it plays into Facebook’s other payments initiatives elsewhere in the world. The company has enabled peer-to-peer money transfers in the U.S., and most recently the UK. Those plays were almost certainly about raising user engagement rather than making money, and this social commerce trial is similar respect, but with an Asian twist.
Facebook might not be the only social network company stepping into this space in Southeast Asia, however. Line, which operates its own payment service and a shopping app in some parts of the region, is also talking to small retailers with a view to launching its own new service, one source with knowledge of discussions told TechCrunch.
Southeast Asia is one of Line’s most important geographies since Indonesia and Thailand are among its top four countries based on active user numbers. The Japanese company claims 218 million active users worldwide and is reportedly planning an IPO this year.",2016-06-09,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/shutterstock_140953558.jpg?w=738,"2c2p,southeast-asia,thailand",Facebook is testing social commerce payments in Southeast Asia

That’s probably not the job description that HTC put out for a new CFO, but, even with the most beautiful prose at its disposal, the company has certainly been challenged to fill the role. The Taiwanese mobile firm started looking for a new CFO in May 2014 and, more than two years later, the long hunt is finally over after it announced that Peter Shen, formerly of Taiwan-based Inotera Memories and HP, has taken the job.

CFO and sales chief are two hugely important positions for HTC, which has publicly struggled financially in recent years, right now.
Q1 2016 represented its fourth straight quarter in the red, with a $148 million loss for the period as quarterly revenue fell by a whopping 64 percent year-on-year. Aside from a spate of disappointing financial results, Chang’s tenure as CFO also saw the company spend time worthless, as it traded at less than its cash in hand, while things got so bad that it stopped providing financial guidance to investors and the public.
HTC’s phones are continuing to bomb in terms of sales — though they are generally well-received by media and loyal customers, like the HTC 10 — but the company is pinning its hopes of a comeback on a series of flagship smartphones and new tech initiatives. The company’s Vive VR headset, which began shipping at a faster two-to-three business day rate this week, is perhaps the most obviously new focus, alongside a suite of wearables, which include a partnership with Under Armour to develop a fitness tracker.
Can HTC turn it around? It has certainly been in a rut for so long that it is hard to see anything redeeming the company and restoring it to former glories, but the future is still to be told. Shen, Chang and co certainly have plenty on their plate for 2016 and beyond.",2016-06-08,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/6f9a9846.jpg?w=738,"mobile,smartphone,taiwan",HTC finally hires a new CFO after more than two years of searching
969,Catherine Shu,"Amazon plans to put $3 billion more into its Indian e-commerce site, said founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. The investment was announced Tuesday evening at the U.S.-India Business Council’s 41st Annual Leadership Summit in Washington D.C., where Bezos and other business leaders met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
This brings the total amount Amazon has invested in Amazon India, which it launched in 2013, to $5 billion. It announced a $2 billion funding back in July 2014.
In a press release from the U.S.-India Business Council, Bezos said Amazon “has already created some 45,000 jobs in India and continue[s] to see huge potential in the Indian economy.”
India’s e-commerce market is now the fastest-growing in the world and is expected to be worth $119 billion by 2020, according to Morgan Stanley.
Amazon India’s main rivals are marketplaces Flipkart and Snapdeal, both of which have significant venture capital banking. According to CrunchBase, Flipkart has raised $3.15 billion so far from investors including Naspers, Tiger Global, DST Global, and Accel; Snapdeal has received about $1.54 billion from backers such as Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, SoftBank, and eBay.
A February report by Morgan Stanley said that Flipkart was the leader by gross merchandise volume (GMV), with 45 percent market share in 2015. Snapdeal came in second with 26 percent, and Amazon India took third place with 12 percent.
Both Flipkart and Amazon India, however, have claimed to be the largest e-commerce marketplace in India by user traffic. At the end of last year, comScore released data showing that Amazon India had more than 30 million unique visitors to its site during Diwali holiday sales in October, which Bezos said made it the most visited e-commerce site in India.
Flipkart then responded with data that claimed its main marketplace and clothing site Myntra (which Flipkart acquired in 2014) received 63 percent of total mobile commerce traffic in December, compared to 15.86 percent for Amazon India, and 13.84 percent for Snapdeal.
But Flipkart is now facing questions about its GMV growth and ability to continue competing with Amazon India. Morgan Stanley, an investor in Flipkart, recently cut the marketplace’s value to $9.4 billion, down from the $15.2 billion valuation it claimed last year after a $700 million funding round.
The heated competition comes at a high cost for all of India’s largest e-commerce players. For example, all three have invested huge amounts of money in logistics, a weak point in India’s commercial infrastructure, and also have to balance tight margins with offering competitive prices.",2016-06-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/shutterstock_372185890.jpg?w=738,"india,amazon-india",Amazon will pump $3B more into its Indian marketplace as it competes with Snapdeal and Flipkart
970,Jon Russell,"Rakuten is downsizing its international presence once again after Japan’s top e-commerce firm announced plans to shutter its e-commerce businesses in three countries in Europe.
The move to close Rakuten.co.uk in the UK and Rakuten.es and Spain, as well as Rakuten’s offices in Cambridge and Barcelona, mirrors a similar streamlining decision in February, when the company pulled out of Southeast Asia, restructured its presence in Brazil and wrote down $340 million in assets.
These latest closes also include the shutting of Rakuten’s operations and office in Austria, although customers in the country will continue to be served out of neighboring Germany. The changes are slated to happen by August, after which Rakuten will focus on France (where its PriceMinister business got downsized) and Germany in Europe because its presence in those countries has “the scale and potential for sustainable growth.”
“In [the] UK and Spain, the cost of growth relative to the size of the businesses has led to plans to close these operations,” Rakuten added in a statement.
A Rakuten spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the shutdowns will not affect a number of the companies other business interests in Europe, including its Wuaki video platform, messaging app Viber, and Fits.me, a fashion e-commerce firm it acquired last year which has an office of its own in London. (It remains to be seen how Fits.me, which is based in Estonia, will feel about the UK exit since presumably much of its ambition was centered around piggybacking Rakuten’s e-commerce business.)
“Subject to consultation processes, approximately 100 employees are expected to be impacted across the region by the current plans to close three marketplaces. Rakuten will offer staff alternatives where these are available,” the spokesperson added.
While the company is contracting in Europe, it also played up new initiatives in France and Germany, which include a membership loyalty program in the former and new low-cost commission program for merchants in the latter.
Rakuten entered the UK when it acquired Play.com for just shy of $40 million in 2011. The site later became Rakuten.co.uk, but it wasn’t able to compete adequately enough for Rakuten to justify putting more resources into the business.
Rakuten CEO and co-founder Hiroshi Mikitani announced Rakuten’s new ‘2020 Vision’ in February this year and removing the deadwood of the group’s less promising businesses has been the first step. Mikitani is putting faith in a number of Rakuten’s more recent acquisitions — Viber ($900 million in 2014), video site Viki (reportedly $200 million in 2013), and U.S. discounts store Ebates ($1 billion in 2014) — which he believes can unlock e-commerce and customer opportunities on mobile.",2016-06-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/rakuten.jpg?w=738,"france,europe,e-commerce,rakuten","Rakuten to exit the UK, Austria and Spain as global retrenchment continues"
971,Jon Russell,"There’s a new company entering the mobile healthcare space in Asia, and it is perhaps an unlikely name. That’s because telecom giant Telenor has launched Tonic, a service that provides basic medical information as well as more sophisticated services.
Tonic has launched first in Bangladesh via Telenor-owned Grameenphone, the country’s largest operator with over 57 million customers.
Bangladesh is the world’s eighth largest country with a population of 168 million people, yet there are just 0.4 doctors per 1,000 people and the World Health Organization estimates that 60 percent of national healthcare spend is not covered by insurance.
Just those two data points alone show that there are plenty of problems to fix. Tonic is aiming to capitalize on the widespread adoption of mobile devices to enable new levels of access to healthcare and more convenient services among the 120 million estimated phone owners.
“There’s a great opportunity in the digital health space,” Sajidur Rahman, CEO of Telenor Health, which runs Tonic, told TechCrunch in an interview. “In a country where almost all people carry a mobile phone, a mobile phone can be a very powerful weapon to help solve problems and make an impact on millions.”
Tonic, a separate company that is wholly owned by Telenor, is initially focused in four main areas. Its ‘Tonic Life’ content portal contains health and illness information, suggestions for positive health change and editorial style content — vetted by doctors — to help catch the attention of Grameenphone subscribers. That’s not unlike the way Google is offering health information in search in India, Brazil and other countries.
There’s also a 24-7 helpline staffed by 30 doctors that enables users to get a very basic diagnosis even if they live far from a doctor, or need information out of hours.
Like other companies that offer additional services beyond those basic blocks — such as Practo and Lybrate, both from India — Tonic includes more advanced options to help increase patient care. Firstly, there’s a cash benefit program that gives users cashback for certain medical expenditures up to four times per year.
Rahman said that, for example, a three-night stay in a hospital could be worth 500 BDT (around $6.35) for a Tonic user. That doesn’t sound a lot, but given that the majority of people are not insured while the minimum salary for a garment worker, for example, is 5,300 BDT per month, it is progress.
Tonic also offers a discount service through which users can find offers for a range of different treatments at hospitals in the country. There are initially 50 partners, but Rahman confirmed there are plans to increase that number.
Initially the service is free and available only for Grameenphone. That latter requirement is unlikely to change, but Rahman explained that the service will move towards a freemium model over time. That won’t happen until a new of new features and more partners are added to the service as it is now.
International expansion is also likely over time, but for now the Telenor Health CEO isn’t giving too many concrete details on that.
“We clearly have the ambition to be in additional markets, [but there’s] nothing specific in mind yet,” he said. “We will look for the right sort of engagement in five to six months in Bangladesh first.”
Tonic sounds much like an m-health startup that a business unit of one of the world’s largest mobile companies. (Norway-based Telenor claims 208 million customers across businesses in 13 countries.) Rahman has a team of 12 full-time staff, with a number of doctors acting as advisors.
“We are operating like a startup, but we are also very careful that we are part of a global brand so very careful about the governance that must happen,” Rahman explained.
This isn’t the first time that Telenor has branched out into digital services. The telecom firm offers a range of mobile banking services in both emerging and first-world countries and initiatives that help industries like agriculture in Asia. With Grameenphone phone the number one operator in Bangladesh by some distance, and Bangladesh itself a hugely challenging market where tech can make a difference, it is not surprising where Tonic is starting out.
Rahman, who is also a director at the Founders Institute in Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, sees real promise in the country beyond simply this initiative.
“The domestic market is huge [and if you] look at the challenges, there are clearly opportunities for startups. This is clearly a market where there is a lot talent and hunger to build businesses, the ecosystem is clearly growing very fast,” he said.",2016-06-07,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/telenor-health.jpg?w=738,"bangladesh,telenor-health,tonic,telenor",Telecom giant Telenor launches a digital health service for emerging markets
972,Ingrid Lunden,"As the on-demand transportation industry continues to heat up in China, one of the bigger online marketplaces for cars is also capitalizing on the growth.
Bitauto Holdings — which both operates a giant car marketplace that we’ve in the past described as Cars.com, Consumer Reports and Auto Trader rolled into one; and also invests in transportation startups — has announced a fundraise of $300 million. The company is traded publicly and is valued at around $1.4 billion; and this latest cash injection is partly notable because of who is making it.
Chinese search giant Baidu, WeChat owner Tencent and e-commerce portal JD.com are each taking investments of $50 million in Bitauto, which is also taking an additional $150 million from PA Grand Opportunity Limited.
Bitauto is not disclosing how it plans to use the money beyond “general corporate purposes.” The company currently makes revenues from advertising, subscriptions, transactions and marketing. Its financials and other metrics are as outsized as the wider economic growth in China: the company is profitable with revenues on the rise, and said that in the first quarter of this  year it generated 27 million sales leads and some 50,000 transactions.
JD.com and Tencent were previous strategic investors, while Baidu is taking its stake as part of a new strategic partnership, in which it sounds like Bitauto will provide inventory for a new auto search on Baidu.
“We are delighted to announce today the strengthening of our strategic partnership with JD.com and Tencent, and the establishment of a new partnership with Baidu, the leader in Chinese language online search,” said Bitauto’s CEO William Li in a statement. “We are also pleased to welcome PAG, a leading regional private investment firm, as an important investor. My personal participation in this transaction is a further testament to management’s strong confidence in Bitauto’s future development.”
While the growing interest both in autos and transportation services are signs of how China’s economy (and specifically its middle class) continues to grow, what’s also interesting is the place that Bitauto might play in the bigger global transportation game of chess.
Bitauto’s CFO was reportedly in talks with Uber last year for the U.S. transportation behemoth to take a stake in Chinese carpooling company Dida Pinche, as part of Uber’s bid to increase its footprint in the country to compete better against Didi Chuxing (formerly known as Didi Kuaidi). While Uber is the biggest and most highly valued of all the on-demand transportation startups, more localized startups like Didi, which itself is valued in the billions, are giving it a run for its money. So why would Bitauto’s CFO be talking to Uber? Because Bitauto is an investor in Dida Pinche, which itself has raised over $100 million.
And, on top of this connection, Baidu is now a common investor between both Bitauto and Uber. It will be interesting to see how and if (and why) there are more connections are made here with Uber in the wake of the Baidu connection between the two.
Back to today’s news, Bitauto says that under the agreement, Tencent, Baidu and JD.com are each purchasing 2,471,577 newly issued ordinary shares of Bitauto at US$20.23 per share, corresponding to US$20.23 per American depositary share of Bitauto (“ADS”).
The PAG investment, meanwhile, is coming in the form of convertible bonds that will be due in five years with an interest rate of 2.00% per annum.",2016-06-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/traffic-in-china.jpg?w=738,"jd-com,tencent,baidu,bitauto","China’s Bitauto raises $300M, with Baidu, JD.com and Tencent each chipping in $50M"
973,Jon Russell,"Netflix has been keen to stress its new global focus since it launched into more than 100 new countries in January. That approach is not just about being available worldwide, it includes programming that is localized to international audiences too and, along that trail, Netflix just announced plans for its first original series from India.
Netflix claims 81 million paying customers across 190 countries, and it has been available in India since January. It hasn’t said how many are from India, the cost of Netflix is higher than local rival services, but the country is clearly a huge opportunity given the billion-plus population while there’s also a significant overseas diaspora, which is pegged at 16 million worldwide.

Netflix said the title will be shot in India and produced in collaboration with local firm Phantom Films. There’s no distribution date at this point, but the U.S. streaming giant did confirm that, once released, it will be available to all Netflix customers worldwide.
“Over the last few years, I’ve watched with great excitement and pleasure as Netflix has transformed narrative television with its ground-breaking, genre-bending shows,” Chandra said. “I’m confident that all the color and vitality and music of the fictional world I’ve lived with for so long will come fully alive on the large-scale canvas provided by Netflix.”

974,Catherine Shu,"Miso, a home cleaning service in South Korea, wants to sweep up some ambitious growth goals after being accepted into Y Combinator’s summer class. The startup’s founders will join the accelerator program this week.
Miso, which lets customers book next-day cleanings through its app and websites, was launched last year by Haksu Lee and Victor Ching.
Ching was chief product officer at Seoul-based food delivery startup Yogiyo before it was acquired by Delivery Hero in 2014. After leaving Yogiyo, Ching decided he could take what he had learned working in food delivery and apply it to a new vertical.
Ching and Lee say South Korea’s home cleaning service market is worth $5 billion and growing thanks to South Korea’s increase in dual-income households. The startup, which has raised $500,000 in pre-seed funding, is targeting revenue growth of 10 percent every week.
Now available in Seoul and neighboring cities Incheon and Gyeonggi-do, Miso currently has about 10,000 customers, 700 of whom use the service more than once a week. Miso has signed up 1,000 cleaners and about half get more than one booking per month.
Miso is among several startups in Seoul, including WaHome (which raised a $1 million seed round last year) and Daeri Jubu, that were launched as an alternative to traditional cleaning agencies.
Agencies usually charge a membership fee, require bookings to be made at least a week in advance, and often expect cleaners to report at a call center and wait until they are sent to a job. Apps give both cleaners and customers more freedom.
Miso wants to set itself apart from other cleaning startups by simplifying its user interface and pricing structure as much as possible. The company currently only offers two options—a four- or eight-hour session—as an alternative to the complicated menu of à la carte services used by many traditional agencies, which are charged on top of a base fee. Customers can request specific tasks, but Miso’s cleaners otherwise just try to do as much as possible in the allotted time.
“Traditionally, businesses offer four or eight hour services, but they charge you more for the same amount of time depending on the size of your house. I didn’t really think that made a lot of sense, because you are still paying for four hours. Some of the pricing structures look like a mini Excel spreadsheet,” says Ching.
“It’s a different pricing table if you want to have a load of laundry done or some kind of cleaning for your fridge. Everything needs an additional fee,” adds Lee. “It’s a big pain point for existing customers and we wanted to simplify it.”
As the business scales up, Miso’s founders want to start offering shorter sessions (as little as two hours) to appeal to people living in small apartments, as well as same-day bookings. Like other on-demand startups, however, Miso has to balance its growth plans with keeping operating costs sustainable while making sure contractors get enough bookings to stick with the platform. Ching and Lee say that cleaners currently earn about 60 to 100 percent above South Korea’s minimum wage (currently 6,030 won, or about $5.18, per hour) after Miso takes a commission.
Cleaners are interviewed before they can start taking jobs through Miso and, like Uber, the startup’s customers rate each service on a five-star scale. The higher a cleaner’s average rating, the more work gets referred to them.
“In terms of ensuring that cleaners get enough work to make sure they stick with us, that is something we are constantly trying to analyze,” says Ching. “I wouldn’t say we have perfected it yet, but there is obviously a certain threshold for when we onboard and how many sessions cleaners do within their first week or two to get them to stick with us.”
“That’s the reason why technology can help innovate the industry,” adds Lee. “We can predict cleaners’ schedules and assign jobs to them very effectively. That will help our entire platform.”",2016-06-06,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/shutterstock_215897260.jpg?w=738,"south-korea,home-cleaning,on-demand,miso",South Korean home cleaning startup Miso joins Y Combinator’s new class
975,Jon Russell,"Groupon continues to streamline its global business after it announced the sale of its operations in Indonesia to a somewhat unlikely buyer. KFit, a one-year-old startup that sells gym and fitness memberships in the same style as U.S.-based ClassPass, is picking up Groupon Indonesia in an undisclosed deal.
Malaysia-based KFit said it has “no immediate plans” to change Groupon Indonesia’s business, which claims to have more than one million subscribers and over 15,000 merchants. That means that the company will branch out into regular deal-based e-commerce that Groupon is famous (infamous?) for. The mechanics of the deal, which is scheduled to close in Q3 2016, are notable too: Groupon Indonesia is to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of KFit, with Groupon Inc becoming “a strategic shareholder of KFit”.
That suggests that there may have been little-to-no price upfront for the transaction. Groupon purged a number of its struggling country businesses last year, so it remains possible that it was open to offloading its Indonesian business at an attractive cost.
The deal signals KFit’s entry into Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country and one of the few sizable markets where smartphone sales are tipped to continue to rise despite a global slowdown. KFit is present in 10 cities in Asia Pacific, including countries in Southeast Asia, Australia, Taiwan and Korea, and it has raised over $20 million from investors like Sequoia Capital — via its India and Southeast Asia fund — and debt-financing from Innoven Capital.
KFit hinted that it would expand into new categories when it announced a $12 million Series A round in January, and Indonesia-based Venturra Capital led its Series A, but few people would have predicted that it would turn out like this. (ClassPass is also venturing into similar ground, it should be noted.)
There are, however, strong links between the two companies. KFit CEO Joel Neoh started group-buying site GroupsMore in Malaysia which Groupon acquired within months of launch. Post-acquisition, Neoh led Groupon’s operations in Asia before leaving to start KFit in 2015. Fellow KFit co-founder Yeoh Chen Chow was regional operations director for Groupon APAC, too.
With Groupon generally on the decline, or at least struggling compared to the days of regular acquisitions worldwide, why would Neoh get back into the business?
There are a few possible answers depending on your personal view.
Indonesia is a huge market, it is tipped to drive Southeast Asia’s internet economy to $200 billion by 2025, and e-commerce remains nascent despite tens of billion of dollars invested by Rocket Internet (Lazada and Zalora) and retail conglomerate Lippo (Matahari Mall). That growth is tempting for ambitious startups, particularly if you can get a rolling start by acquiring a business and get a favorable acquisition cost, too.
That’s the more positive theory, but there remains the strong possibility that KFit is diversifying because its current model isn’t working as well as expected. Back at that Series A, we reported that KFit was operating with a pretty serious burn rate — negative $320,000 in Q3 2015, according to internal documents we had seen — which had put it months from running out of cash in late 2014. It could be that the opportunity to re-enter the group-buying space, where Neoh has had success, is seen as a way to augment the finances and provide an engine for growth.
“Indonesia represents an untapped opportunity for us and serves as a natural expansion of our regional footprint in Southeast Asia,” Neoh said in a press statement.
“The combination of Groupon Indonesia’s established presence and KFit’s experience in building a mobile-first platform will propel us in a high-growth local commerce market, further accelerated by increasing mobile penetration,” he added.
Speaking to TechCrunch in an interview, Neoh confirmed that he was unable to provide details of the deal itself — since Groupon is a public company and the transaction is pending — but he did explain that it is somewhat an “anomaly.”
“It’s a very specific case as we’ve been looking at the [Indonesian] market since the end of last year. It’s very attractive [country] for a consumer-facing company,” he said.
Neoh said KFit may enter one or two more cities before the end of this year, but it isn’t actively seeking out other M&A opportunities. Going forward he said the company will experiment with new models for the Groupon business.
“We want to build a platform [for] any time you are going out to experience local services… we’re building beyond a deals platform,” he said.
That’s also the focus for KFit’s 10 other cities in Asia Pacific, but they are likely to develop the model at a slower pace than Indonesia, where KFit has this Groupon momentum, Neoh added.

976,Catherine Shu,"After postponing it for two years, Line may finally go public. According to reports from the International Financing Review and the Wall Street Journal this week, the company, which is best known for its messaging app, is contemplating a dual initial public listing in Tokyo and New York City this summer.
Line may also hold an IPO in Tokyo as soon as next month, says the WSJ.
A Line spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company does not “have any confirmed decision at the moment.” If it goes forward, the IPO may raise $2 billion to $3 billion and value Line at more than $5 billion.
This is almost less than half of the $9.8 billion valuation Line reportedly anticipated when it first applied to go public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in summer 2014. But the company, a subsidiary of South Korean Internet giant Naver, postponed its plans in order to tackle growth in global markets.
A few months later, in December 2014, Its former COO, Takeshi Idezawa, was appointed to CEO. Just before his promotion was announced, Idezawa told TechCrunch that the company wanted to prioritize growth and user engagement before holding an IPO.
Despite its efforts, however, Line failed to establish an international foothold and its user growth has plateaued, with just four Asian countries—Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia—accounting for about 69 percent of its 218 million monthly active users.
The messaging app landscape is also different than it was two years ago. After a wave of consolidation, a handful of players (WeChat, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger) have pulled ahead in many of the markets Line wanted to tackle.
Line makes most of its revenue through sticker sales and in-app games, but it’s also attempted to build its messaging app into a platform with enough services (streaming music, mobile payments, food delivery, taxi hailing, shopping, digital assistants etc.) to become indispensable to users as they go about their daily lives. The company created a $42 million fund to invest in services that it can potentially integrate and also made several acquisitions, including streaming music service MixRadio.
It’s still unclear, however, if Line’s efforts to grow into a lifestyle platform (a strategy WeChat has excelled at) will succeed and there are already signs it may be struggling. For example, in February, Line announced the closure of MixRadio, just 14 months after purchasing it from Microsoft.",2016-06-02,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/line-india-10-million-users.jpg?w=738,"naver,messaging,line,line-corp","After a long delay, Line may hold an initial public offering"
977,Jon Russell,"Uber says it is on course to topple bitter rival Didi Chuxing and become China’s most popular ride-on demand service within a year.
That’s according to Zhen Liu, SVP of Strategy at Uber China who oversees the company’s business in the country. During an interview at Converge in Hong Kong, Liu stated her firm would overtake Didi on overall marketshare within the next twelve months.
Liu claimed Uber is growing rapidly in China, to the point that it is only a matter of time before it snatches the top spot.
“Last year, we were only operating in eight cities and we were [at] about one percent marketshare. A year later, we are about one-third of the marketshare and operating in over sixty cities across China,” she said.
A change at the top would represent a remarkable achievement for Uber. The firm has only been in China for just over two years and, as its own CEO has acknowledged, it has poured billions into a fierce rivalry with four-year-old Didi — which itself was created via a merger when China’s top two ride-sharing firms abandoned an expensive subsidies battle to join forces in 2015.
Generally speaking it is hard to find accurate data that measures how Uber and Didi, which is present in over 400 cities, are performing in China, although most reports and watchers peg Didi as being a large margin ahead. Nevertheless, China remains the most important market for Uber worldwide, Liu said. Six of Uber’s top ten busiest cities are located in China, and she expects that China will continue to account for even more of its top locations. 
Uber China earlier this year raised more than $1 billion at a $7 billion valuation, and Liu said that the company is actively raising funding once again. From her comments and part history, it seems likely that some of that round will come from parent company, Uber Inc, which just closed a $3.5 billion investment from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF). Although Liu did not explicitly say that.
Didi, by contrast, is backed by local Chinese giants including Alibaba and Tencent, while Apple recently joined the party with a landmark $1 billion investment in the firm last month. Interviewed separately at Converge, Didi’s Senior Director for International Strategy, Li Zijian, was more diplomatic on the rivalry, pointing out that his firm isn’t concerned with others.
“There’s lot of competition in the ride-sharing market, that’s true [but] what we are really doing is to focus on what’s in front of us,” Li said. “It’s like running a hurdles race, if you want to win a hurdles race the only thing you need to focus on is what’s in front of you. You don’t really look over your shoulder to see what other athletes are doing.”",2016-06-02,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/uber-china.jpg?w=738,"taxi-apps,china,uber-china",Uber: We’ll be China’s number one taxi app within a year

Here’s a quick recap in case you aren’t familiar with the Thumbtack model. If you need to hire a plumber, a guitar teacher, a photographer and more, you can tell the platform what you’re looking for. Over the next 24 hours, professionals can bid on your request. The client can finally pick a service provider based on reviews and quotes.
While this system might not be efficient enough if there’s a giant leak in your bathroom or you’re in the middle of a power outage, many projects require you to find the right person — for home improvement, event-based and teaching jobs, waiting a day or two before connecting with the right professional seems fair.
And it seems to be working as the startup has generated around $900 million (€800 million) in business volume — StarOfService takes a cut from this number. The startup has developed specific websites for Italy, Spain, Germany, the U.K., Poland, Australia, Canada, Turkey, Brazil, India and France.
Even though StarOfService started as a copycat, it looks like the startup has bigger ambitions now. It seemed unrealistic a couple of years ago, but maybe the startup now has a shot at becoming the global leader in this market — minus the U.S.
While Thumbtack has a ton of funding, if the company doesn’t expand internationally quickly enough, there might not be enough room to compete properly with StarOfService outside of the U.S.
With today’s funding round, StarOfService plans to expand internationally more aggressively. This kind of companies require a lot of capital for search engine optimization, online ads and recruiting professionals. And if this expansion is working, it’s just step one as there should be more expansion pushes in the future.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/starofservice.jpg?w=738,"france-newsletter,starofservice",StarOfService raises $10 million for its service marketplace
979,Megan Rose Dickey,"I’d like to tip my imaginary hat off to Jessica O. Matthews, the black female founder and CEO of renewable energy tech startup Uncharted Play. Her company just closed a $7 million Series A round led by the NIC Fund with participation from Kapor Capital, Magic Johnson Enterprises, BBG Ventures and Lingo Ventures.
With the new injection of funding, Uncharted Play plans to build out the team and better equip itself to support the partners the company is bringing on in the coming months. Uncharted Play’s mission is to spread awareness about global energy and clean power through technology and play.
The $7 million investment in Uncharted Play makes Matthews the 13th black female founder who has raised more than $1 million in outside investment. Earlier this month at Disrupt SF, Morgan DeBaun of Blavity said that she’s raised over $1 million in funding and is still actively raising. DeBaun was the 12th black female founder to raise over $1 million.
In the tech ecosystem, black female founders receive basically zero venture capital. Of the several thousand venture deals that went down from 2012 to 2014, less than 1 percent of them went to black women, according to a recent report by #ProjectDiane. And the black women who received outside funding on average only got $36,000, while the average seed deal size in February of this year was $4.5 million, according to CB Insights. At the time of the #ProjectDiane report, only 11 black female founders had raised more than $1 million in outside funding.
Uncharted Play’s first product, SOCCKET, is a soccer ball that doubles as a power generator. The SOCCKET uses the rotational energy that gets generated every time the ball rolls to produce three hours of light for every hour of play.

Uncharted Play’s second product is the PULSE, a jump rope that doubles as a light. Both the SOCCKET and PULSE are powered by MORE (motion-based, off-grid, renewable energy, Uncharted Play’s proprietary technology for micro-generator systems. Those systems can integrate into anything that moves, which is what transforms the product, like a soccer ball or a jump rope, into a source of off-grid power. Uncharted Play’s goal is to better utilize kinetic energy in order to complement or even replace other energy systems.
Uncharted Play’s business model entails partnering with product manufacturers across industries like consumer electronics and infrastructure to put the MORE technology inside the everyday products we use, like strollers, shopping carts and suitcases. The idea is that you could then use the energy produced by that product to charge your cell phone and other things.
“We not only aim to disrupt how energy is generated, but how it is consumed,” Matthews said. “We envision a world where people shift from a ‘hoard & save’ energy mentality to a ‘continuous and on­-demand’ energy experience.”",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/jessica-matthews-e1474310380985.jpg?w=738,"include,energy",Black female founder raises $7 million for renewable energy tech startup
980,Romain Dillet,"In case you missed it, Aircall announced last week that it had raised another $8 million dollars in funding for its call center software-as-a-service. Balderton Capital is leading this Series A round, with New York-based VC firm FJLabs and existing investors also investing.
I’m a bit late to the news because last week was TechCrunch Disrupt SF. It’s worth mentioning that because Aircall also participated in the Startup Battlefield at Disrupt SF a year ago. But Aircall has grown quite a lot since then.
The company started in 2014 and was a simple software-as-a-service for support teams. You could create virtual phone numbers in many different countries and manage calls with different people answering — a sort of modern call center for small support teams. The company raised $800,000 from eFounders and business angels at the time.
Aircall has then drastically improved call quality, added features to make it easier for bigger teams, added integrations with popular services, such as Salesforce or Zendesk and launched mobile apps. The company also raised $2.75 million from Balderton Capital, FundersClub and business angels in January 2016.
There are now many different features when it comes to setting up your call center. You can decide opening hours, add a custom waiting music, distribute calls, record calls, queue customers, transfer calls and more. And with today’s new funding round coming just a few months after the previous one, it confirms what I’ve heard about the company’s incredible growth rate.
Following this round, the French company plans to expand in the U.S. with a new office in New York. Co-founder and CEO Olivier Pailhes plans to move there. The team of 30 will double over the next twelve months. Aircall now has 2,000 customers.

982,Steve O'Hear,"DueCourse, a cloud-based invoice financing service for SMEs, has raised £6.25 million in new funding. Backers include GFC (the venture arm of Rocket Internet), Alex Chesterman (founder and CEO of Zoopla), and Simon Franks (co-founder of Lovefilm, acquired by Amazon). Also noteworthy is that the new capital is a split between £1.25 million of equity and £5 million of debt.
The latter is a reflection of the Manchester, UK company’s business model: it lets small- to medium-sized businesses access cash tied up in their yet-to-be-paid invoices. But, rather than operating a peer-to-peer lending marketplace, DueCourse is doing the lending, hence its own debt-financing.
“We allow small businesses using cloud accounting the ability to access the money tied-up in their unpaid invoices whenever they like, in just a few clicks,” explains DueCourse co-founder and CEO Paul Haydock. “The product is free to install, setup takes minutes, and any money requested is then in their bank account within an hour”.
The ability for SMEs to access invoice financing at such a speedy rate is born out of DueCourse’s use of data and its own risk models. This includes pulling in data from the cloud accounting services it plugs into, which include Xero, SageOne, and FreeAgent.
“The rise of cloud accounting within the SME market over the past few years has enabled us to access real-time accounting information, which we combine with other external sources of data to generate a proprietary risk score for lending to small businesses,” says Haydock.
This then enables the startup to generate a risk score that combined with DueCourse’s “data-driven decision engine” tells businesses (a) whether they are eligible to take advances against invoices and (b) the cost to access the money tied up in unpaid invoices.
He also says that DueCourse differs from the traditional invoice finance model that requires an SME to handover all invoices, sign a lengthy contract, “and involves the finance company informing all customers that the SME is in a finance arrangement”. In contrast, DueCourse is confidential (end customers are never aware a business is using the service).
“Businesses can choose how often they use it, and when they use it, whether that’s hiring new people, funding new resources or purchasing equipment,” adds Haydock.
Meanwhile, I’m told that the company plans to raise a Series A round of £10-15 million in the next 10 months to expand its service globally.",2016-09-19,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-18-at-13-50-41.png?w=738,,"DueCourse, a cloud-based invoice financing service for SMEs, raises £6.25M"
983,Max Moruzzi,"

Over the past few years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been the white-hot center of a flurry of activity. Startups that create embedded sensors for physical things have been snapped up by larger companies at a rapid pace, with deals for IoT startups totaling more than $30 billion in the past four years.
The IoT may well be The Next Big Thing, but maybe the attention around sensors is misplaced…
What if we didn’t even need embedded sensors to allow things to gather data about their surrounding environment? What if material could be a sensor in and of itself?
Sentient materials might sound like the stuff of sci-fi, but it’s quickly becoming a reality. A new generation of materials is being developed that can sense temperature, pressure, impact and other variables — completely removing the need for sensors.
Not only can these materials capture and relay data to the cloud, they also can reconfigure themselves on-the-fly to react to changing environmental conditions. It’s as if materials are becoming not just smart, but “alive” — and it will change the way things are designed and used in startling ways.
How did we arrive here? Design and engineering used to focus on materials that behaved isotropically — which is to say, uniformly and predictably. In the isotropic age, you would create a design and then assign a material to carry out a specific role in that design.
What if, however, you allowed materials to determine design, rather than vice versa? We see this in nature all the time. A seed, for example, works together with a specific environment to create a tree.
This is an example of anisotropic materials in action. Unlike isotropic materials, their behavior isn’t predetermined, so their performance can be tailored to their environment.
Welcome to the anisotropic age of design.
Imagine an airplane skin that self-heals to remove dings and dents, thereby maintaining optimal aerodynamics. In the isotropic age that’d be virtually impossible to design — but in the anisotropic age, it becomes a possibility.
Here’s how it would work: An airplane component (like the wing) is made out of a composite material that has been coated with a thin layer of nanosensors. This coating serves as a “nervous system,” allowing the component to “sense” everything that is happening around it — pressure, temperature and so on.
When the wing’s nervous system senses damage, it sends a signal to microspheres of uncured material within the nanocrystal coating. This signal instructs the microspheres to release their contents in the damaged area and then start curing, much like putting glue on a crack and letting it harden.
Airbus is already doing important research in this area at the University of Bristol’s National Composites Centre, moving us closer to an aviation industry shaped by smart materials.
The automotive industry, meanwhile, can use smart materials to manufacture cars that not only sense damage and self-heal, but also collect data about performance that can be fed back into the design and engineering process.
The Hack Rod project — which brings technology partners together with a team of automotive enthusiasts in Southern California — is out to design the first car in history built with smart materials and engineered using artificial intelligence.
In another example, Paulo Gameiro, coordinator of the EU-funded HARKEN project and R&D manager for the Portuguese automotive textiles supplier Borgstena, is developing a prototype seat and seatbelt that uses smart textiles with built-in sensors to detect a driver’s heart and breathing rates, so it can alert drivers to tell-tale signs of drowsiness.
Beyond transportation, more opportunities await in the construction and civil engineering fields, where smart materials can greatly assist with structural health monitoring.
Today, the world has hundreds of roads, bridges and other pieces of infrastructure that are slowly falling apart because of wear and tear and exposure to the elements. More often than not, we don’t even know which items need our attention most urgently.
But what if you could build these structures out of “smart concrete”? The “nervous system” within the concrete could constantly monitor and assess the status of the infrastructure and initiate self-repair as soon as any damage was sustained.
There is a major project currently underway at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), called ZERO+, that aims to reshape the construction industry with exactly these types of advanced composite materials.
The researchers at MIT are also hard at work at the newly formed Advanced Functional Fabrics of America (AFFOA) Institute. Their goal is to come up with a new generation of fabrics and fibers that will have the ability to see, hear and sense their surroundings; communicate; store and convert energy; monitor health; control temperature; and change their color.

These functional fabrics mean that clothes won’t necessarily just be clothes anymore. They can be agents of health and well-being, serving as noninvasive ways to monitor body temperature or to analyze sweat for the presence of various elements. They can be portable power sources, capturing energy from outside sources like the sun and retaining that energy. They even can be used by soldiers to adapt to different environments more quickly and efficiently.
And if you accidentally rip a hole in your garment? Naturally, the nanosensors within the fabric will engage a self-repair process to patch things up — in the exact same way the airplane wing and the smart concrete healed themselves.
This is no Hollywood movie — this is reality, and a clear indicator of how quickly smart materials are coming along.
These materials have an increasingly important role to play in shaping the world around us — whether that’s airplanes and infrastructure or the clothes on our backs. By creating things that can not only capture data about their environment, but also adjust their performance based on that data, materials are starting to play an active role in design.
This is the potential of smart materials, and it’s one of the keys to creating a better-designed world around us.",2016-09-17,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/clayearth.jpg?w=738,"sensors,iot",How smart materials will literally reshape the world around us

Traveling the globe used to be relegated to gap years and retirement fantasies, but thanks to tech innovation and some forward-thinking startups, you can now see the world while you take the professional realm by storm.
Digital nomads are free-spirited freelance and tech workers who need little more than an internet connection and a passport. They’ve taken the concept of remote work out of the home office and made the big, wide world their workplace.
With half of the American workforce spending some time each week working remotely, it’s only a matter of time before they jump on the digital nomad bandwagon. What was once a dream is now a very tangible reality — and these groundbreaking startups are making it easier than ever to climb the career ladder while trotting the globe.
One of the biggest hurdles to traveling the world is finding a place to stay that is affordable and meets your workspace needs. Fortunately, there are several startups working to cover the digital nomad’s lodging needs.
Nomad House is one of the co-living spaces facilitating the digital nomad lifestyle. The housing network matches digital nomads with co-living arrangements that are safe, comfortable and equipped with all the amenities a traveling worker needs. The company’s 10-day retreats offer an option for potential digital nomads to get their feet wet before jumping right into the lifestyle.
Nomad House was founded in 2015. The company is headquartered in Montreal, Canada. Funding and employment information has yet to be publicly disclosed; reports show minimal growth from August 2015 to present.
Roam is another digitally minded collection of communal living spaces that make working from anywhere in the world possible. The company was founded in 2015 and has since raised $3 million in funding. Travelers sign one lease with Roam and gain access to a number of fully equipped houses worldwide. Roam ensures a private room, a bathroom, a “battle-tested” Wi-Fi connection and a vibrant community of like-minded people with whom to engage.
The commitment that goes along with signing an actual lease with Roam means its customers can fully emerge themselves in the digital nomad lifestyle after signing up.
WeWork is also getting into this sector in a big way. The service provides access to working spaces around the world with your WeWork membership. Depending on the amount of space you need, you can rent out a “hot desk,” a dedicated desk or a private office. This is perfect for remote workers and remote teams looking to stay connected during regular trips outside of the country or maintain daily operations while traveling to meet with international teams.
The company was founded in 2010 and has raised $1 billion in total funding. WeWork has hired 1,243 employees, and reports show major growth taking place at the startup since in March 2016.
While a hotel room — or even an Airbnb setup — can cost upwards of $100 per night, these nomadic startups are designed to make sure travel isn’t cost-prohibitive. Roam offers co-living arrangements for around $500 per week. Nomad House also offers 10-day retreats at around $550. Nomad House, Roam and WeWork also offer long- and short-term rentals that let workers spend anywhere from two nights to two months in their location of choice.
One drawback of working from anywhere is that it’s harder for the office or your needy client to get ahold of you when you’re halfway around the world. Many remote workers need to keep close connections and respond in real time to requests or crises. YouRoam is a mobile app created in 2013 that lets you make and receive calls no matter where you are. Best of all, YouRoam makes all those international calls virtually free.
You don’t need to change your number, rely on a signal from your carrier or pay astronomical roaming charges. YouRoam lets you call and text anyone anywhere using Wi-Fi and 3G. The app is currently set up for call-forwarding in 36 countries, but users can still reach out to someone in countries without call-forwarding; it will just count against plan minutes.
The company hasn’t disclosed funding information and shows a slow growth pattern in reports, but has certainly created a buzz in the startup sphere.
If instant messaging is more your thing, Telegram lets you connect and collaborate no matter where you are. This messaging startup uses the cloud to help you communicate safely, securely and quickly. Messages are encrypted and can be set to self-destruct, which means your trade secrets will be protected even when you’re working on public Wi-Fi in a cafe in Paris.
Telegram was founded in 2013. The company has decided not to disclose funding information and has showed signs of exceptionally high growth in the past year.
Most digital nomads still have ties to a permanent office or residence, but managing the daily details of life is hard when you’re on a different continent. Thankfully, startups like Earth Class Mail and World Time Buddy (WTB) have created an app for that.
No matter how electronic we go, plenty of things are still delivered via snail mail every day. Earth Class Mail is a mail scanning service that will digitally deliver letters and other mail to you and follow your instructions about what to keep, what to recycle and what to destroy. Whether you receive mail at your home or the office, Earth Class Mail will take care of it for you — and you never need to worry about missing something important while you travel.
The company was founded in 2004 and currently employees a staff of 32. To date, Earth Class Mail has received $21 million in funding.
One of the trickiest things about travel is dealing with different time zones. WTB is a world clock converter and meeting scheduler that lets you schedule personal and professional events at a glance over multiple time zones. With a number of useful features, like Google Calendar integration, WTB is a great newer tool for working away from home.
WTB has not disclosed funding information. According to reports, growth took a dive around November 2015, but shot back up in December 2015, and has maintained steady growth through 2016.
As remote work continues to grow and more people refuse to compromise lifestyle for professional success, the digital nomad lifestyle is now even more attainable. If you’ve ever dreamed of leaving the cubicle behind and hitting the road, these startups provide the insider help you need to make it happen.

985,Matthew Lynley,"Many of the largest companies in the world — like Facebook with FBLearner — have built an edge for themselves by making the process of studying their users and data science ongoing, tracking closely how things change over time. But for other businesses, those studies might just end with a single chart or predictive analysis report.
Ian Swanson started DataScience about two and a half years ago in order to provide those businesses with that kind of information. The company employed data scientists internally that would work with outside businesses. But over the past year, DataScience has been working to build an array of tools — ones that they’ve used internally — that businesses can hand to data scientists internally to essentially get the same thing done, which is launching today in the form of DataScience Cloud.

“Data scientist, and data science, is a pretty narrow focused term like a lot of roles: statistician, actuary, and so on,” Swanson said. “The common term we might hear is data science. They spend a lot of time performing engineering tasks, many times they fail to make an impact in their business. They might create from a simple standpoint some SQL queries, start to build a model using python or R, but once they create that model, one they can predict a user is leaving business, what do they do with it? You have to become algorithmic.”
Part of the challenge that led to DataScience was the process of actually building out those models. For example, it might be easier to put together a predictive model using Python, R or MATLAB for a data scientist, but it may need to be implemented in Java to be used across the organization. If the data scientist isn’t an expert in Java, that means handing the project over to an engineer to write through it in Java and not being able to make any adjustments to it without going through that engineer (or, of course, learning Java).
With this tool, data scientists can constantly tweak and update their models as new information comes in, as well as do it in the language they prefer. That keeps those teams more nimble and able to react more quickly to changes in the way people are using their tools. And it also means they have a better understanding of the scope of the models they can build and run, rather than there being a communicative disconnect between multiple departments in a company.

Another part of the problem was making sure that the query process was adaptable across multiple different skill sets, Swanson said. Because the role of “data scientist” is so overarching and becoming larger, there are a lot of roles that have expertise in small parts of the puzzle, and DataScience has to fill in the holes by making it easier to query the right information. Any queries done through DataScience can also operate on NoSQL databases as well. In the end, getting that data has to be fast, easy, and highly open to interpretation if it’s going to be a viable product for a large array of companies.
There are a couple of risks when it comes to a business like DataScience and a product like this. The main one is whether a company with a similar tool — or others with similar tools — would simply widely open source their tools in order to speed up the rate of development on them. That would allow other companies to start implementing those tools, and even start to build additional businesses on top of them.
Swanson’s argument against that is DataScience is handling the infrastructure side of things as well. Data science models often exist on servers that are constantly online, but aren’t always running those operations, he said, so that’s why the company has a pay-per-compute pricing model similar to what Amazon Web Services has.
DataScience has raised $28 million in funding total from Crosscut Ventures, Greycroft Partners and Whitehart Ventures.",2016-09-16,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/ui_screen-1.png?w=738,datascience,DataScience launches a service to easily query info and build models from anywhere
986,Haje Jan Kamps,"The last time you had a key cut, you probably experienced a retro service, which included speaking to a real human (ugh!). KeyMe puts the kibosh on the old-fashioned key copying user experience with a series of new kiosks and just landed a $15 million Series C round to fund aggressive expansion.
“KeyMe is poised to help tens of millions of consumers securely and conveniently copy keys at their local retailer,” Greg Marsh, founder and CEO of KeyMe told me, explaining that the company is eager to disrupt what it claims is a $7.5 billion per year industry. “This new round of funding will help us meet explosive retailer demand for tens of thousands of new kiosks.”
The Series C was led by QuestMark Partners. It’s a smaller round than the company’s previous $20 million Series B nine months ago, but it brings the total of funds raised to $45 million.

987,"Matthew Lynley,Katie Roof","We’re hearing from our sources Unilever has been in serious talks with the Honest Company, and may very well win the bid for the e-commerce startup, though our sources stressed that the deal is in early stages.
As usual, the deal is fluid and the final details could change (or not happen at all), and the exact price in the conversation could not be learned, though one source said the price could be more than $1 billion. The Honest Company would be the latest in a string of acquisitions in the e-commerce space by larger operations and consumer packaged goods companies. Unilever earlier this year acquired Dollar Shave Club in another massive $1 billion deal, one of a number of large e-commerce acquisitions in recent months. Walmart also acquired Jet.com — another e-commerce operation that was burning through a remarkable amount of cash to grow — for around $3.3 billion.
It also underscores, even with the success of companies targeting a narrow array of products, that e-commerce operations with strong brands may still face steep challenges and make more sense in the scope of larger CPG and e-commerce companies with ample financing. With enough capital — and not subject to the whims of investors and Wall Street — larger operations and consumer packaged goods companies can wait out the loss-leading periods as they grow and potentially end up with highly profitable divisions with strong branding.
Last week, reports emerged that The Honest Company was in talks with larger consumer packaged good companies to sell itself (Re/code first reported the story, and we too heard this was the case). From that information it would seem the batch would have included companies like Proctor & Gamble, but we hear from our sources the deal is probably going to come from Unilever.
The Honest Company sells a number of consumer products like diapers, baby formula, bath and body care, and even laundry detergent. It’s also known for its high-profile co-founder, actress Jessica Alba, but there has also been a big surge in care and beauty products also driven by the popularity of personalities. One case is ipsy, a makeup subscription service that’s worth more than $500 million and recently raised $100 million, which has piggybacked on the immense popularity of online personality Michelle Phan. The Honest Company, too, has started expanding into beauty products, and it remains to be seen if it’ll be a successful venture.
Highly targeted online products go beyond simple consumer packaged goods as well. While The Honest Company is gunning for beauty products, for example, there are startups like Curology emerging targeting acne care. The general trend here is that startups are increasingly starting off with, or simply focusing entirely, on a narrow branch of products in the hopes to overtake larger e-commerce companies that are hoping to sell a wide array of products and may not necessarily have the time or capital to invest heavily in one division alone.

The Honest Company has also been the target of lawsuits, and at TechCrunch Disrupt NY earlier this year Alba said the company was working to be as transparent as possible with its customers. In August last year, The Honest Company raised $100 million at a $1.7 billion valuation. Altogether, the company — founded in 2011 — has raised around $220 million. There have been whispers that the company is also slowly preparing for an IPO, but it looks like those plans may be nixed.

988,Anthony Ha,"Optimizely has helped to popularize A/B testing — the idea of trying out different versions of a website or mobile app to see which one performs better.
However, co-founder and CEO Dan Siroker said the practice has largely been limited to marketers testing relatively superficial changes, such as the text or the layout of a page. So today, at its Opticon user conference, the company announced a new version of its platform, now dubbed Optimizely X, which Siroker said will allow for “experimentation in code.”
“We made experimentation accessible to the mere marketing mortal — we made this good idea something that anyone could do,” Siroker said. “That same thing will happen for developers.”
For example, Optimizely says customers will be able to experiment with search results, product recommendations, pricing and various product features. While I suggested that experimenting with the core functionality of your website or app might seem a bit riskier than fiddling text, Siroker replied, “Most of our customers love the idea of experimenting as a way to mitigate risk.

989,Lora Kolodny,"Large manufacturers of high-tech products, from luxury vehicles to elastomers and resins, have lined up to invest in and partner with Carbon (formerly known as Carbon 3D) the Redwood City, Calif. company known for its rapid, 3D-printing technologies.
The three-year-old startup added $81 million in venture funding to its Series C round from strategic investors, including BMW Group, GE, Nikon and JSR Corp., and earlier venture backers including GV and Sequoia Capital, among others.
Carbon plans to use the new funding to manufacture and lease their CLIP or “continuous liquid interface production” technology, and develop and sell materials to customers internationally.
Carbon CEO and co-founder Joe DeSimone said:
Using Carbon’s CLIP tech, manifest in their flagship M1 machines, manufacturers can make functional prototypes, or a small volume of parts, 25 to 100 times faster than they could using other industrial 3D printers, DeSimone claims.
Parts made on Carbon machines, using the company’s cloud-based design software, resins and elastomers, have different mechanical properties and a smoother surface than parts produced on traditional CNC machines.
That’s because they’re not deposited layer by layer, cut or milled. They’re sculpted, in effect, by precisely applying light and oxygen, to a liquid pool of material. That enables users of Carbon to create lattices, which can give objects like drones or vehicles structural integrity without unnecessary weight.
Early customers of Carbon include a Hollywood special effects studio called Legacy Effects, BMW and Ford Motor Co.
Carbon also supplies its printers to service bureaus like Sculpteo, and The Technology House in Cleveland, where industrial designers or consumers can outsource custom prototyping and parts production.
By now, Carbon has leased out 50 of its machines, and expects to have 100 operating in the field by the end of the year, and 500 in the next year at least.
It also has clients and partners in aerospace, athletic apparel, automotive, consumer electronics, industrials and medical devices and equipment.
According to Carbon board member Jim Goetz, a partner at Sequoia Capital, the startup’s new, strategic backers are “lighthouse customers, people who could transform their own businesses through new approaches to manufacturing.”
He expects Carbon, long-term, has the potential to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., particularly the Midwest, and could do something similar in parts of Asia and Europe where manufacturing once boomed.
The new expansion round brings Carbon’s total venture capital raised to date to $222 million. The company is valued at $1 billion.
The CEO confirmed this will likely be the last time Carbon seeks venture funding.
The company generates recurring revenue by renting out its machines, or leasing them on three-year contracts. It also generates revenue from selling resins, elastomers and other materials it develops to users of those printers.
This business model makes Carbon distinct from companies that sell large, industrial 3D printers outright.
The company is competing against large incumbents like Stratasys, which is newly committed to the industrial market for 3D printing after previous and disappointing initiatives to spark a consumer trend with desktop 3D printers.",2016-09-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/carbon3d.jpg?w=738,"sequoia-capital,stratasys",Carbon raises $81 million for international expansion of its rapid 3D-printing tech
990,James Currier,"

The recent $26 billion LinkedIn acquisition by Microsoft was the largest in the history of the software industry, and the $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition by Facebook in 2014 was close behind. These are examples of how much value is created by companies that achieve true defensibility.
Some advisers tell founders, “Don’t worry about defensibility. Focus on doing something to delight customers and do it better.” That’s okay.
But, if I have a choice, I’d rather start a business where I know if it works, it will be defensible… that I can really protect it from competition. For a long time.
The punch line here is that the best way to get true defensibility in the digital world seems to be by using network effects. We’ll get to that.
The key to understanding this more broadly is that nearly all of the massive returns to you and your investors — the 100X or 500X returns — come from businesses that have long-term defensibility. For early-stage investing it’s the big hits that drive returns. So having a line of sight to defensibility matters, even for early-stage investing.
In the old days, the business literature listed many ways to create defensibility: unique access to raw materials, favorable geographic location, government regulations like tariffs, patents and licenses, etc.

In the digital world, however, these have largely melted away. In software, information transparency is much higher, geographic borders mean less, it’s easy for customers to click to a competitor, etc.
What we’re left with are a short list of competitive advantages and just a handful of true defensibilities.
“Competitive advantages” help your company become successful.  “Defensibility” helps you stay there. Both add value to your business. Here are eight competitive advantages that are currently working well in the digital world:
 

Speed. Going faster is a significant advantage in the short and medium term. It’s the No. 1 competitive advantage every startup can give itself. At NFX Guild, this is one of the critical things we screen for in our Guild members.
Capital. Like we’ve seen with Uber, Square or NextDoor, the ability for a team to raise more capital lets a company hire faster, buy market share and move to set up real defensibilities. Further, raising a lot of capital helps scare other investors from investing in your competition. (It can also lead to errors in judgment that hurt the company, but that’s another story.)
Unique Team. Either technical talent or having unique insight into a customer/market.
Content. Companies like Zillow, Yelp and Facebook were places for users to get unique content at launch or shortly after launch.
Buzz. When companies like Slack or Meerkat capture the elusive imagination of influencers in tech and media, it makes it easier to fundraise, hire talent, get press and get noticed by customers.
Relationships. People do matter. Having a personal advantage with a customer can be an advantage for a time against competition.
Silicon Valley. Companies located here have a competitive advantage because of access to capital, press, talent and creative insights from the dense network of people working on similar problems.  The numbers prove it.
Patents. These can apply, but we’re seeing them apply less over time in software and the digital world.
If you build a business with good competitive advantages, your value grows linearly as you grow revenues. That’s good.  But if you’re able to move past competitive advantages to true defensibility — to really being able to protect your business from competition — your value grows exponentially.

In the digital world, there are few defensibilities. Today, we count just four.
 

Economies of scale (example: Amazon). When you get bigger, a host of advantages accrue to you.  More users means more volume, means you can get cheaper prices from suppliers, means lower prices for customers, means higher conversion rates, makes your advertising more effective than your competition, etc. The numbers all move in your favor, and math is hard to compete with.
Brand (examples: Booking.com, Google). With brand, a certain company can stand top of mind when we think of something we need, like booking.com when I need a hotel room. Priceline, the owner of Booking.com, spends more than $2 billion per year in advertising to make sure that’s true. Further, people come to identify themselves with brands. People who want to associate with Apple products will not comparison shop. Those psychological barriers make it very hard for competitors to break in.
Embedding (examples: Workday, Oracle, SAP). Embedding works when you integrate your software into a customer’s operations so the customer can’t rip you out and replace you with a competitor. This is obviously more prevalent when customers are organizations, not individuals, and is typically accompanied by a direct sales force to drive the embed.
Network effects (examples: LinkedIn, Alibaba, Craigslist). A network effect is when another user makes the service more valuable for every other user. Once your company gets ahead, users won’t find as much value in your competitors’ smaller networks.
There are five major types of network effects. Direct (LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook); two-sided (eBay, Craigslist, Microsoft, iOS); data (Google Maps, Waze); tech performance (BitTorrent, Skype); and interpersonal (Slack, Apple).
Each of these makes your business hard to catch once it gets going. They make it defensible.
Network effects have emerged as the native defense in the digital world. Fortunately, creating network effects are available to startups from Day One. As such, we consider network effects the most important type of defensibility, and thus, the surest route to value creation.
If you’re starting or investing a business, don’t start it until you’ve thought thoroughly about how to design it with one or more of the core network effects. Then think about how every new feature you build could add value to the other users of your product. That way of thinking about business and product design puts you on the road to true defensibility and massive impact and value creation.",2016-09-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/armor.jpg?w=738,"competition,network-effects",Defensibility creates the most value for founders
991,Josh Constine,"The online learning market is becoming as crowded as the app stores. Ranku offers the equivalent of SEO assistance to make sure colleges with electronic courses convert visitors into students.
Now Ranku (pronounced ran-koo) is being acquired by publicly traded education conglomerate John Wiley & Sons. A source familiar with the deal confirms to TechCrunch that the acquisition price was around $25 million.
That’s not “F-You Money,” but it’s a strong exit for a startup that had only raised $650,000. The startup scored that seed round in 2014 from Mark Cuban, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Microsoft Accelerator, Archangel and Deborah Quazzo. They should see healthy returns on their small investments.

Ranku’s story is also a testament to the power of pivots. The startup changed directions several times.
Ranku launched in 2013, founded by Kim Taylor and Cecilia Retelle. Ranku was a comparison shopping site for legitimate universities offering online degrees. It was designed to save people from enrolling in scammy for-profit schools like University Of Phoenix Online, Kaplan and Everest.
By 2015 Ranku had refocused on naive international students who might not know which schools are actually prestigious. Eventually it began working directly with schools, providing them with analytics about their web traffic-to-enrolled student funnel, and helping them tailor their courses to demand.
Ranku’s product could fit nicely amongst Wiley’s many tentacles that reach across the education space. It sells print reference books and journals, professional development training, test prep and online course management tools for schools, amongst other services. Ranku should be able to optimize Wiley’s various offerings to match the fast-moving trends in what people want to learn.

“There are so many affordable online degree programs within state systems and community colleges but without the right strategies and tools, many are going undiscovered,” writes Taylor. ”With Wiley’s support, Ranku can ensure that potential applicants are discovering the programs that are right for them and enable both the student and institution to be successful.”
It’s a wisely timed buy for Wiley. Education is poised for a rapid shift from one-size-fits-all traditional school and online courses to personalized learning systems that account for whether someone learns best from reading, visuals, lectures, independent work or group projects. Students will need the best education they can get to still find jobs in the post-AI/robotics world.",2016-09-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/ranku.jpeg?w=680,"edtech,ranku",Ranku’s eCollege optimizer bought by edtech giant for ~$25 million

The success of high-tech accelerators has ignited the creation of similar models around the country hoping to replicate their accomplishments. But their achievements have not come without criticism.
The exclusivity of the high-tech sector in general is reflected in the lack of diverse entrepreneurs being supported by high-tech accelerators and, to a lesser degree, by high-tech incubators.
This lack of inclusion matters because women and minority entrepreneurs are significantly underrepresented in high-tech. Incubators and accelerators offer critical support to entrepreneurs — from business education to access to capital and expanded networks — and can be an effective tool for increasing the number of women and minority-owned businesses in the high-tech sector. Unfortunately, they are not making an impact because of the low participation rates of women and minority entrepreneurs in these organizations.
A recent report by the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City digs into the barriers preventing women and minority entrepreneurs from fully participating in high-tech incubators and accelerators.
The good news from this report is that many high-tech incubator and accelerator leaders already recognize that lack of diversity is a critical issue for their organization and many want to address this issue, but are unsure of how to effectively do so. The other good news is that some organizations, high-tech incubators in particular, have already implemented strategies and practices that are creating impressive diversity rates (often around 30-40 percent) and helping to change the high-tech status quo.
These success stories prove that high-tech incubators and accelerators can be more inclusive and serve as a promising tool toward creating a more inclusive high-tech sector.
The report identifies four types of barriers facing women and minority entrepreneurs: recruitment, selection biases, program design and culture. Recruitment and selection biases may prevent diverse entrepreneurs from gaining access to high-tech incubators and accelerators, while programs that aren’t flexible and an exclusive, macho culture may make them not want to.
To create inclusive organizations, it takes deliberate actions on the part of incubator and accelerator managers to recruit women and minority entrepreneurs and to create programs that meet their needs.
Recruitment
Some high-tech incubators and accelerators simply don’t actively recruit any entrepreneurs. Unfortunately, women and minority entrepreneurs are less likely to find their way to these organizations than white men because they may not know about them, may not feel like they are a good fit or may not feel like they would be selected. Other incubators and accelerators struggle with limited pipeline networks and a lack of knowledge about how best to find diverse entrepreneurs.
Selection
Selection biases play out all along the incubator/accelerator system. Selection panels are often not diverse and people are more likely to identify with and select entrepreneurs who look and act like themselves. Ingrained cultural notions of what successful high-tech entrepreneurs look like also create biases. Private high-tech accelerators, whose reputations are built on ventures graduating with large infusions of venture capital, might find women and minority entrepreneurs less attractive because they attract less capital.
Program design
The program design of traditional high-tech accelerators, which often require intensive, in-person residency, may fit the lifestyle of the stereotypical young, white, male entrepreneur, but not others.
Culture
The macho, exclusive, hyper-competitive culture of some high-tech accelerators is the image marketed and shared by media, creating perhaps the biggest deterrent to women and minority entrepreneurs. High-tech incubators and accelerators can’t be both intentionally exclusive and hope to attract more diverse entrepreneurs.

The recommendations and strategies set forth in this report offer a playbook for creating more inclusive high-tech incubators and accelerators. Hopefully, the documented barriers that exist for women and minority entrepreneurs in the high-tech sector will provoke a greater urgency for change in these organizations.",2016-09-15,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/diversity-e1425048481664.jpg?w=738,inclusion,What it will take to create inclusive high-tech incubators and accelerators
993,Jon Russell,"Samsung has confirmed that it is recalling the Galaxy Note 7, its newest smartphone, following reports that some devices exploded.
The device was launched less than a month ago to very positive reviews, but concerns about the battery in some units — which reportedly combusted while charging — have forced the company’s hand. Yesterday, Samsung confirmed it was investigating the issue, and now it has taken quick action to avoid potential tragedies.
Samsung said it has sold 2.5 million devices so far, and it plans to replace them all in “the coming weeks.” It added that it is aware of 35 cases of faulty batteries, although it isn’t clear how many of that number had exploded.
“We acknowledge the inconvenience this may cause in the market but this is to ensure that Samsung continues to deliver the highest quality products to our customers. We are working closely with our partners to ensure the replacement experience is as convenient and efficient as possible,” the company said.
The timing is particularly painful for the Korean firm, with arch-rival Apple set to unveil its latest iPhone next week. Any sales advantage that the Note 7 had will be wiped out, while there are obvious question marks around the safety of the device, too.
The Note 7 looked like being a continuation of positive progress for Samsung this year. Its Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge phones were released to glowing reviews earlier this year and impressive sales helped Samsung to its most profitable quarter for two years.
Rather than pushing things on, today’s confirmation of a recall leaves Samsung in a sticky position.

994,Sarah Perez,"Google is today expanding to more developers access to its “Early Access” beta testing program. This program, launched earlier this spring, gave Android developers the ability to better reach early adopters willing to try their app while still in beta, ahead of its public launch. Through the “Early Access” section on the Google Play Store, users could discover a curated list of interesting, new applications to download.
Initially, inclusion in this program was only available to a hand-picked group of 29 app and game partners, but today Google is opening up “Early Access” more broadly.
Though Google already offered a way for developers to run open beta tests for their apps, in May it began allowing developers to enroll users into beta tests right from the Play Store landing pages. Meanwhile, the idea with the “Early Access” collection on Google Play was to highlight the best upcoming applications for those developers who don’t yet have an active user community.

In just over a month after the collection became available to all Google Play users, the open beta titles were installed more than 1 million times. Launch partners like language learning developer Lingbe, online book club Readfeed and Lego were among those who participated in “Early Access,” using their spot to attract users, validate their app’s concept, get feedback, identify bugs, test game mechanics and more.
However, being featured in “Early Access” was previously based on Google’s discretion alone. There was no way to request a spot. Today, that changes — Google is introducing a sign-up process for Android developers, which will allow them to nominate their app for consideration.

That’s not a guarantee that the app will be included in “Early Access,” of course, but it’s a way to at least request inclusion. Google says new titles will be added weekly, and thousands of users are available to test.
The program’s expansion comes at a time when Google (and Apple) are working on better ways to help indie developers have their applications discovered in what have become sizable mobile application marketplaces. Google Play now has more than 2 million apps available for download, which means finding new apps and games to try by browsing the top charts or categories isn’t always efficient. Often, users find new apps via app store search, advertising and word-of-mouth recommendations.
Being able to test an app ahead of launch to work out the kinks is valuable, as you may only have one shot at retaining a user’s interest after download… if they ever launch the app at all.",2016-09-01,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/android-early-access.jpg?w=738,"google-play,android-apps,mobile,apps",Google Play’s beta testing program “Early Access” opens to more developers
995,Sarah Perez,"Today, Apple is previewing of some of the first apps that will integrate with Siri in the upcoming release of iOS 10. Announced at WWDC earlier this year, one of the biggest changes in Apple’s new mobile operating system is the ability to interact with your apps using your voice. Soon, you’ll be able to ask Siri to do things like compose and read your texts, search your photos, book rides in apps like Uber, pause your workout app, make payments to friends, place a call using a third-party VoIP app, and much more.
Already, Siri offered some limited functionality with third-party apps, like Twitter and Yelp, but now Apple is opening up the ability for users to “talk” to their apps more broadly.
SiriKit
This functionality is made possible through SiriKit – a new toolkit for iOS 10 developers which allows them to build in an extension into their app that communicates with the virtual assistant Siri.
Siri will handle the user interaction – meaning, voice and natural language recognition – and then works with the extension in question to get the information from the app and handle the user’s request.

At WWDC in June, Apple detailed how this would work, offering specific examples like WeChat, WhatsApp, Slack, Uber, Lyft, Didi, EyeEm, Pinterest, Runtastic, RunKeeper, Venmo, Number26, Skype, and Viber. Getting an on-stage shoutout, as it turns out, was a good indication that those apps were among the first who would be integrating the new voice functionality.
Many of those in the list will be ready to work via voice when iOS 10 debuts.
Others Apple has confirmed to be integrating with Siri include Skype, LinkedIn, Square Cash, Monzo, Vogue Runway, Looklive, The Roll, and Pikazo.

Today, Apple is kicking off a series of blog posts that will introduce the forthcoming Siri-powered applications, and explain how they work.
This is something unusual for the company, which normally makes developer-related announcements at WWDC, then pushes its new mobile OS out the door as timed with its iPhone event in the fall.
But perhaps a little end user education is in order this time around? Or maybe, the popular voice computing platform, Amazon Alexa, is looking like a bit of a threat these days.
Already, Alexa lets you do things like call for an Uber, check the news and weather, order a pizza, start a workout, play a game, and more.
But Apple’s advantage is that Siri is already installed on people’s devices, and we’re comfortable asking the assistant for help with simpler tasks, like creating appointments, or getting our schedules. Asking it to call us an Uber or launch a call is an obvious next step.
Ride-Hailing with Siri
With iOS 10, ride-hailing apps like Uber, Lyft, China’s Didi Chuxing (also an Apple investment) and Europe’s myTaxi will be taking advantage of the new functionality. What’s interesting is that you don’t have to learn some stilted voice commands to talk to these apps via Siri.
Sample commands include things like “Hey Siri, get me a DiDi ride to the airport,” or “Hey Siri, ask myTaxi to get me a taxi to Parliament Square,” for example.

When you’re asking for a ride from an app that offers different tiers, like Uber, you’ll be able to pick which one after saying something like “Get me an Uber to SFO.” The app will then display the available Uber products, like UberPOOL, UberX, and others, as well as a fare estimate and ETA.
Once the riders are connected with a driver, they’ll see the car in real-time in Apple Maps, along with the vehicle and driver information – the latter thanks to Uber’s use of MapKit.
“We are always looking for ways to work with partners to further integrate Uber into the daily lives of riders around the world,” explains Rahul Bijor, Senior Product Manager at Uber.
He says the implementation of SiriKit took a few months.
“The main challenge we faced was figuring out how to design and build an experience that made the most of Apple’s new functionality, and identifying the best way to leverage the intelligence of Siri for our users,” says Bijor.
That’s something that many developers will struggle with in the months ahead, as well. Integrating with Siri is one thing, but doing it in the right way to best serve the app’s users will be the concern.
Making Calls with VoIP apps via Siri 
Apple is also showing off how voice-enabled apps will function in the workplace, as with Cisco’s Spark. The new version of Spark will let users search for contacts and place calls via Siri. For example, you’ll be able to say “Hey Siri, video call Luisa on Spark,” among other things.
SiriKit and CallKit integrations will then work together to pass the contact information to Spark and launch the call. What’s handy about the way this has been implemented is that if Spark doesn’t have the contact information, it can search iOS contacts for what it needs, then make the call.

“Spark was built specifically for the mobile user—it’s all about making sure users on the go can connect from wherever they are, so integration with Siri is a natural fit,” explains Riley Marsh, Spark’s iOS lead developer. “We prioritized the implementation so users can get their calls started by just using their voice—they can call any contact – personal or corporate directory contact – from one screen view.”
Calls made with Vonage Essentials – another upcoming Siri-powered app – will work similarly. And in the future, Vonage will enable Siri to find information that resides in corporate backend systems, the company says.
“For example, we would integrate SiriKit with the other Vonage app functionality such as messaging/texting for hands-free texting,” says Sagi Dudai, VP Mobile Development for Vonage. “The magic happens when Vonage starts doing more sophisticated development with iOS10, such as integrating business workflow, such as CRM software, with voice and messaging using Siri commands.”

Dudai adds that iOS 10 provides a better user experience for voice apps like Vonage. Before, push notifications were required to receive a call, and users would have to get past the lockscreen to get to their call. Meanwhile, when native calls came in, the VoIP call was put on hold.
“All this changes with iOS10 CallKit, where VoIP calls behave exactly like native calls in every respect,” Dudai continues.
“By having the same functionality and user experience as the native dialer, it’s not really necessary to use a traditional carrier for voice or text. Apple has removed the last barrier for adopting VoIP as a standard for mobile communication,” he says.

A New Way of Using Apps
Voice-powered apps are arriving at a time when App Store ecosystem is going through some growing pains. Because of its now massive size – over 2 million apps across 25 categories – app discovery has become more of a challenge. Users are simply not being exposed to new apps, and those they download are often soon abandoned.
At the same time, Apple’s developer community continues to grow. There are now 13 million developers worldwide who have earned over $50 billion to date since 2008. However, for the indie developer, getting an app noticed and used is harder than after.
Voice-powered apps could change that. Being able to launch apps by speaking instead of having to search for them in Spotlight, or manually flipping through your device’s many screens, could potentially boost app usage by making apps more accessible to end users. It may also make apps simpler to use, as you won’t have to figure out where various settings and controls are located, you can just speak.",2016-09-01,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/siri-kit.jpg?w=738,"mobile,apps",Apple shows off the first Siri-powered apps arriving in iOS 10
996,John Mannes,"Global mobile payments company Boku announced a $13.75 million funding round today led by a consortium of UK investors. The company had previously raised approximately $77.25 million from Khosla Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Index Ventures, Benchmark, and Andreessen Horowitz among others.
The relatively small round, within the greater context of the company’s past fundraising efforts, includes investors that could be considered strategic. Japanese company GMO Payment Gateway is participating in the round. The UK consortium also included angel investors Andrew Black and Robert Markwick. Black notably founded Betfair, the worlds largest online betting exchange.
Boku enables mobile payments to be powered by carrier billing, rather than traditional credit cards and bank accounts. Much in the same way that we text money to charity, Boku lets cell phone users charge things like game purchases directly to their carrier.
To U.S. cell phone users, this may initially seem like an odd concept. One reason is because Apple does not allow carrier billing in the United States. Perhaps more importantly however, U.S. companies are still skeptical of “bill cramming.” While not as large of an issue today, it was common in the early days of carrier billing for some merchants to deceive customers into approving unwanted charges on their phone bill.
“U.S. consumers are important to us but not necessary for our business,” said Adam Lee, chief product officer for Boku. “If it never takes off in the U.S., we are still bullish about our growth.”
Globally however, carrier billing has been growing rapidly as companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft have incorporated the feature into many of their services. Today, Boku processes hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions across 55-60 countries. The company’s largest markets include the U.K., Germany, Japan, and Taiwan.
Lee notes that the growth of on-demand services like Uber will bolster the use of Boku in environments outside of the remote purchase of premium digital content. Cell phone owners use carrier billing for a variety of reasons, but ease of use and security usually top the list, explains Lee.
“Boku requires the least change to consumer behavior in the mobile payments space and the least amount of things a merchant needs to do,” said David Weiden, partner at Khosla Ventures.
 To get up and running, all consumers have to do is complete a simple SMS handshake to confirm they are using the device they plan to charge to. The company doesn’t see itself as a direct competitor to other mobile wallets, but rather sees itself as a component of a larger ecosystem of payment options.
“Think about Boku like cash,” added Weiden. “We don’t buy flatscreen TVs with cash either, but at the Deli maybe we use cash.”
On the merchant side, companies like Facebook already work with Boku to facilitate swift transactions for gamers and other consumers of digital content. Boku takes a small percentage of all transactions as its revenue stream much like Visa or MasterCard.
While the round is smaller, Lee notes that the company is approaching profitability and that the capital is reflective of what the company needs today.",2016-09-01,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/boku.png?w=738,"boku,khosla-ventures,mobile-payments",Boku locks down another $13.75M to fund carrier connections for global expansion
997,John Mannes,"With new 360 video cameras hitting the shelves — alongside matching headsets — in time for the holiday season, millions of new users will be looking to consume VR content. Facebook recognizes that one of the biggest impediments to the enjoyment of 360 video is excess motion.
The company released a demo today of its new 360 video stabilization technology. The new technology combines traditional 2D motion models with 3D models and a new “deformed-rotation” model.
“Our investment in video is something we have talked about for a while,” said Jay Parikh, vice president of infrastructure engineering at Facebook. “We have been pretty verbal about saying this is important, we are building these experiences, VR, 360 and Live.”

Johannes Kopf, the research scientist who led the effort, explained that he used a variety of open-source technologies like OpenCV and OpenGV to build the stabilization tool. While neither of these tools are new, the application to stabilizing video is unique.
Moreover, both 2D and 3D stabilization have been used before, but an implementation of both in the same tool enables fast and accurate stabilization. The team decided to only use 3D analysis for key frames. Rather than equally spacing out the key frames, a tracker identifies specific frames with spikes in activity. Kopf explains that once the 3D reconstruction is applied, the system can differentiate rotational and translational camera motion. This effectively allows the final 2D optimization to be more effective. Once aligned, the key frames are locked and used as reference points. This is when the deformed-rotation model comes into play, and local deformations are fixed.
While not all of us can appreciate the complexity behind the new modeling, we can all get behind reduced motion sickness from watching our favorite videos with a 360-degree field of view.
In addition to increased stabilization, videos also play more efficiently. If the same playback quality is maintained, videos will have a 10-20 percent reduction in bit rate.
In the old days, post-processing even a short 2D video for stabilization was a time-consuming process. Facebook prioritized speed for their new 360 video stabilization. The result is that videos can be stabilized at less than 22 milliseconds per frame. It actually takes less time to process videos than to play them.
While Facebook is experimenting with the technology internally, it has not been open sourced yet.
“We are still discussing plans, what we have learned, and how we handle this,” said Parikh. “There’s still lots of R&D left.”
Kopf and his team are also toying around with a hyperlapse tool for 360 video. The algorithm for speeding up videos anchors playback timing to camera velocity. In layman’s terms, this means that if you film an urban bike ride with your GoPro, you can share the playback in high-speed without awkward traffic stops. Kopf says another benefit of pegging timing to velocity is the reduction of acceleration. Watching acceleration in a VR headset, when it isn’t occurring in real life, can cause fun-killing motion sickness.

998,Jay Donovan,"You may recall Vince Vaughn’s faux stock photo campaign that accompanied his 2015 movie Unfinished Business. In those campaign photos, the actor had his head cleverly photoshopped into bland, business stock photography. There’s a reason that stunt was so funny. It’s because we all recognize the banality of so much stock photography.
To be clear, there is still great work out there too, but you have to work to find it.
A startup from Columbus called BYLINED is aiming to make it a bit easier for brands and people to come together in a win/win situation resulting in better photography or at least in more unique photography.
Through their free app and photo ecosystem, BYLINED enables photo buyers (typically brands, agencies or publishers) to issue a request for a certain type of photo—an assignment or commission so to speak. The buyers choose a bounty they’re willing to pay for “product-oriented photos that best capture their brand-promise or product in use.”

Once the assignment is saved to the platform, app users (or BYLINER’s as they are called) are notified of the assignment through the BYLINED mobile app. They submit photos via the app and winners are selected and paid. Photos purchased by buyers are licensed royalty-free.
BYLINED currently monetizes through 25% service fee charged to the brand, based on the bounty price the brand sets. Subscription models are planned for 2017.

There are other crowdsourced photo apps out there like twenty20 and Foap (which is very similar to BYLINED) or even Chute. BYLINED differentiates itself by focusing on product-oriented photos and by providing meta-data for every photo. Plus, their model is only assignment-based. There is no regular marketplace like in Foap and in this way—according to founder David Hunegnaw—”we are keeping our platform focused on the reason we exist – customer engagement!”
Regardless of similarity, I think there’s room in the market for competition here. And as Smartphone cameras get better and better, their capabilities are making it easier and easier for us to fake being good photographers. So it’s good news for citizen shutterbugs.
Who it’s not good for, I suspect, is professional photographers. Could some pros be disintermediated by this process? Possibly, but that has been happening to many art forms in the digital age. It’s possible that, instead of fighting with new systems, pro photographers could find a new revenue stream, assimilate and dominate services like this with the skills of their trade, because photographic composition and lighting techniques that accompany real photoshoots are an actual art.
I asked my friend and pro photographer Jason Poteat what he thinks about services like this and his response was even-keeled:
He went on to say:
One also has to wonder if Smartphone photos will ever end up having their own stigma like cheesy stock photos? Will it ever be possible for “the smartphone photo look” to become recognizable and therefore stale? I don’t know, but that would probably be a great problem for a company like BYLINED to have.
The startup just raised $250,000 through LOUD Capital and a group of angel investors. BYLINED founder David Hunegnaw is also a Partner/Executive in Residence with LOUD Capital. It’s also worth noting that Columbus-based prototyping powerhouse Big Kitty Labs are equity partners in this venture and built the app.",2016-08-31,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/bylinedchuckphoto.jpg?w=738,"stock,photography,digital-art",Bylined crowdsources product photos for brands
999,Sarah Perez,"More of the content we’re looking for is saved in mobile applications, which is why Google has been working to bring that information to the surface by indexing apps in search. Now, it will do the same thing on your phone, too. The company is introducing a new search mode in its Google app called “In Apps,” which will allow you to search inside your mobile applications for things like contacts, messages, music, videos, tasks, notes and more.
For example, Google suggests you could use the “In Apps” search mode to find something you and a friend were chatting about several weeks ago in one of your messages threads – like the name of a new restaurant. Or you could use the search feature to pull up your favorite song in a music streaming app, or a video from YouTube.
Currently, “In Apps” search only works with Gmail, Spotify and YouTube, but Google says it’s working on adding Facebook Messenger, LinkedIn, Evernote, Glide, Todoist, and Google Keep in the coming months.

Unlike Google searches, which take place on remote servers, this “In Apps” search takes place entirely on your phone, the company says. That means your private information is not sent to Google, and you can perform searches even when you’re offline. You can also configure which apps will appear by going to the Google App’s Settings and toggling the various apps on or off.
Google has already been working to bring in-app content to search by way of its app indexing project, which was expanded last year to include apps that didn’t also have matching web content. It even rolled out a search feature that let you stream the app from a virtual machine when you didn’t have it installed on your device.
However, some of the content in apps is not the kind of thing a standard Google query can locate – While you can easily pull up a hotel’s rate or today’s weather, personal content like your grocery list or a message to a friend is not indexed. To bring that into the Google Search app, the app has to be able to dive into the mobile operating itself, which is why this feature is currently only available on Android.

Google also notes that the upcoming LG V20 phone will be the first phone to offer a dedicated shortcut on the homescreen and Second Screen to the new “In Apps” mode.",2016-08-31,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/screen-shot-2016-08-31-at-9-20-36-am.png?w=738,"search,mobile,apps",Google’s Search app on Android can now find content buried in your apps
